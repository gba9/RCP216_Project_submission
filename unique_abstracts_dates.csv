Oscillatory spatial profile of alcohol's effects on the resting state: anatomically-constrained MEG.	DOI: 10.1016/j.alcohol.2013.12.004	It has been firmly established that opening and closing the eyes strongly modulate the electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG) signals acquired during wakeful rest. Certain features of the resting EEG are altered in chronic alcoholics and their offspring, and have been proposed as biomarkers for alcoholism. Spontaneous brain oscillations are also affected by pharmacological manipulations, but the spectral and spatial characteristics of these changes are not clear. This study examined effects of the eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting paradigm and alcohol challenge on the spatial profile of spontaneous MEG and EEG oscillations. Whole-head MEG and scalp EEG signals were acquired simultaneously from healthy social drinkers (n = 17) who participated in both alcohol (0.6 g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55 g/kg for women) and placebo conditions in a counterbalanced design. Power of the signal was calculated with Fast Fourier Transform and was decomposed into its constituent theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (15-20 Hz) frequency bands. High-resolution structural MRI images were additionally obtained from all participants and used to constrain distributed minimum norm inverse source power estimates. The spatial estimates of the main generator nodes were in agreement with studies using a combined fMRI-EEG approach. Alpha band oscillations dominated the spectral profile and their source was estimated to the medial parieto-occipital area. Power in theta and beta bands was weaker overall and their sources were estimated to a more focal medial prefrontal area. EO and EC manipulation most strongly modulated power in the alpha band, but a wide-band power increase was observed during the EC condition. Alcohol intoxication increased alpha power, particularly during the EC condition. Application of this methodology to cohorts of chronic alcoholics or individuals at risk could potentially provide insight into the neural basis of oscillatory differences that may be predictive of the vulnerability to alcoholism.

Effects of alcohol on sleep and the sleep electroencephalogram in healthy young women.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2006.00111.x	Although the association between sleep and alcohol has been of interest to scientists for decades, the effects of alcohol on sleep and sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) have not been extensively studied in women. Our specific aim was to determine whether sleep stage variables and/or spectral characteristics of the sleep EEG are altered by alcohol administration in women.

Spatio-temporal processing of words and nonwords: hemispheric laterality and acute alcohol intoxication.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2014.02.030	This study examined neurofunctional correlates of reading by modulating semantic, lexical, and orthographic attributes of letter strings. It compared the spatio-temporal activity patterns elicited by real words (RW), pseudowords, orthographically regular, pronounceable nonwords (PN) that carry no meaning, and orthographically illegal, nonpronounceable nonwords (NN). A double-duty lexical decision paradigm instructed participants to detect RW while ignoring nonwords and to additionally respond to words that refer to animals (AW). Healthy social drinkers (N=22) participated in both alcohol (0.6 g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55 g/kg for women) and placebo conditions in a counterbalanced design. Whole-head MEG signals were analyzed with an anatomically-constrained MEG method. Simultaneously acquired ERPs confirm previous evidence. Spatio-temporal MEG estimates to RW and PN are consistent with the highly replicable left-lateralized ventral visual processing stream. However, the PN elicit weaker activity than other stimuli starting at ~230 ms and extending to the M400 (magnetic equivalent of N400) in the left lateral temporal area, indicating their reduced access to lexicosemantic stores. In contrast, the NN uniquely engage the right hemisphere during the M400. Increased demands on lexicosemantic access imposed by AW result in greater activity in the left temporal cortex starting at ~230 ms and persisting through the M400 and response preparation stages. Alcohol intoxication strongly attenuates early visual responses occipito-temporally overall. Subsequently, alcohol selectively affects the left prefrontal cortex as a function of orthographic and semantic dimensions, suggesting that it modulates the dynamics of the lexicosemantic processing in a top-down manner, by increasing difficulty of semantic retrieval.

Time-of-day effects of ethanol consumption on EEG topography and cognitive event-related potential in adult males.	DOI: 10.2114/jpa.19.249	Time-of-day effects of ethanol consumption on EEG topography and cognitive event-related potential in adult males were studied. Ethanol (0.5 g/kg) or control drink was orally administered to nine healthy males at 10:00 and 18:00. The alpha 2 amplitude was significantly lower than that of the control at 0.5, 2.5 and 4.5 hours after ethanol consumption in the morning. These effects were observed in the left hemisphere and were only found after consumption in the morning. The subjectively rated attention was significantly lower than that of the control at 0.5 and 2.5 hours after ethanol consumption in the morning and at 0.5 hours after ethanol consumption in the evening. In contrast, the search speed of serial search task and P300 amplitude was significantly lower than that of the control at 2.5 hours after ethanol consumption in the evening. These results demonstrate that effects of ethanol are dependent on time-of-day of consumption. Ethanol consumption significantly lowered the alpha 2 amplitude when consumed in the morning, and lowered P300 amplitude when consumed in the evening.

Impairment due to combined sleep restriction and alcohol is not mitigated by decaying breath alcohol concentration or rest breaks.

Effects of alcohol on TMS-evoked N100 responses.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.06.030	TMS combined with simultaneous EEG is a novel brain imaging tool allowing investigation local excitability of human cortex. As alcohol acts through increasing function of A-type gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors and attenuating the function of glutaminergic NMDA-receptors-related excitation, we tested whether TMS-evoked N100 response which is thought to reflect cortical inhibitory processes, might be affected by alcohol. Ten healthy subjects ingested alcohol (0.8 g/kg) and EEG responses from 60 channels before and after alcohol ingestion were recorded after left motor-cortex stimulation. Alcohol almost abolished TMS-evoked N100 response. Control experiments with a piece of plastic placed between the head and coil to exclude auditory artefacts were conducted. Alcohol effects were similar when EEG responses from control experiments were subtracted from real-TMS. Alcohol-induced decrease was similar at ipsilateral, contralateral and frontal EEG sites suggesting that alcohol may change cortico-cortical connectivity of motor cortex. Alternative explanation is that alcohol has overall suppression effect on motor cortex. N100 may provide a useful marker of neural inhibition of human cortex for drug research.

Convergent and divergent effects of odors and emotions in depression.	DOI: 10.1111/1469-8986.00023	The aim of the present study was to investigate the similarities and differences in the olfactory and visual processing of emotional stimuli in healthy subjects and in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Twenty-five inpatients were investigated after admission to the psychiatric clinic. Fifteen of them participated a second time, shortly before their discharge from the hospital. A group of healthy subjects, matched according to age and sex, served as a control. Chemsosensory event-related potentials (CSERPs) were recorded using the constant flow method. In addition, event-related potentials (ERPs), in response to colors and emotional slides, were obtained to control modality and emotion-specific effects. The subjects' task was to discriminate the colors (red/yellow) and odors (phenyl-ethylalcohol = rose/ isobutyraldehyde = rotten butter) according to their quality and to judge the valence of the emotional slides (IAPS slides). The EEG was recorded from 32 scalp locations. At the beginning of the therapy, visual stimulus processing was attenuated in depressive subjects at a relatively late processing level (reduced amplitudes of the P3 and pSW in response to colors and emotional slides), whereas olfactory stimulus processing had already been affected at an early level (reduced amplitudes of the P2 and P3-1 peaks in MDD patients). However, after successful medical treatment, ERPs did not differentiate between depressive patients and healthy controls. We discuss whether functional deviations within the primary olfactory cortex are responsible for the lower olfactory sensitivity, as well as for the altered emotional stimulus processing in MDD patients.

Habitual moderate alcohol consumption desynchronizes circadian physiologic rhythms and affects reaction-time performance.	DOI: 10.3109/07420528.2010.515763	"The authors studied longitudinally four healthy young adults to explore if habitual evening intake of a ""moderate"" amount of wine alters parameters, including period (τ) of circadian rhythms. Subjects, synchronized by diurnal activity from 07.30 h ± 60 min to 23.00 h ± 90 min and nocturnal rest, were studied during a continuous 22-day span: 11 days without alcohol (control) and 11 days with a glass (200 mL) of wine nightly at supper (alcohol). The amount of alcohol ingested with dinner ranged from 0.28 to 0.42 g/kg/24 h/participant and the estimated evening blood alcohol level ranged from 0.02 to 0.10 g/L/participant. Single reaction time (SRT; yellow light signal), three-choice reaction time (CRT) (red, green, and yellow signals) of both hands, related cumulated errors (c-errors), as well as oral temperature (OT) and grip strength (GS) were measured four to seven times/24 h. Time series were analyzed individually to quantify 24-h means (M), circadian τ (power spectra), and cosinor, and correlation, χ(2), and t tests were performed. The sleep-wake τ (actography) was 24 h in every subject for both conditions. With alcohol, all subjects showed an OT circadian τ shorter than the control one. The SRT circadian M was longer (poorer performance) with wine versus control in three subjects, while CRT was longer with wine versus control in only one subject. Correlation analyses also showed the detrimental effect of alcohol on the same variables. Number of days with <2 c-errors was predominant in control and decreased with alcohol, especially for SRT. The desynchronization of the 10 different documented rhythms was greater with alcohol with reference to control in two of the four studied subjects. This work shows that habitual ""moderate"" wine drinking at supper reduces the performance of subjects, increases the level of c-errors/24 h, especially for SRT, suggesting a ""moderate"" amount of alcohol has the potential to increase accident risk, and it can also desynchronize circadian time organization."

When the brain changes its mind: Oscillatory dynamics of conflict processing and response switching in a flanker task during alcohol challenge.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0191200	Despite the subjective experience of being in full and deliberate control of our actions, our daily routines rely on a continuous and interactive engagement of sensory evaluation and response preparation streams. They unfold automatically and unconsciously and are seamlessly integrated with cognitive control which is mobilized by stimuli that evoke ambiguity or response conflict. Methods with high spatio-temporal sensitivity are needed to provide insight into the interplay between automatic and controlled processing. This study used anatomically-constrained MEG to examine the underlying neural dynamics in a flanker task that manipulated S-R incongruity at the stimulus (SI) and response levels (RI). Though irrelevant, flankers evoked automatic preparation of motor plans which had to be suppressed and reversed following the target presentation on RI trials. Event-related source power estimates in beta (15-25 Hz) frequency band in the sensorimotor cortex tracked motor preparation and response in real time and revealed switching from the incorrectly-primed to the correctly-responding hemisphere. In contrast, theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) were sensitive to the levels of incongruity as the medial and ventrolateral frontal cortices were especially activated by response conflict. These two areas are key to cognitive control and their integrated contributions to response inhibition and switching were revealed by phase-locked co-oscillations. These processes were pharmacologically manipulated with a moderate alcohol beverage or a placebo administered to healthy social drinkers. Alcohol selectively decreased accuracy to response conflict. It strongly attenuated theta oscillations during decision making and partly re-sculpted relative contributions of the frontal network without affecting the motor switching process subserved by beta band. Our results indicate that motor preparation is initiated automatically even when counterproductive but that it is monitored and regulated by the prefrontal cognitive control processes under conflict. They further confirm that the regulative top-down functions are particularly vulnerable to alcohol intoxication.

Effects of alcohol on spontaneous neuronal oscillations: a combined magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2005.04.014	Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) can detect different aspects of alcohol effects on auditory processing measured with event-related potentials and magnetic fields. The present study aimed to detect alcohol-induced changes in spontaneous neuronal oscillations with combined EEG and MEG techniques. The effects of alcohol on spontaneous neuronal rhythms were studied in 12 healthy subjects after 0.8 g/kg alcohol or juice in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design using simultaneous high-resolution MEG and EEG in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. The data were analyzed with a power spectral density analysis. MEG recording showed that alcohol significantly increased the relative power of alpha rhythm (8-10 Hz) and reduced the relative power of beta activity (17-25 Hz) in both left and right hemispheres, but only in the eyes-closed condition. These effects did not depend on gender. No analogous statistically significant changes were observed in EEG rhythms. However, the power of alpha and beta rhythms was positively correlated in MEG and EEG recordings, indicating that MEG and EEG reflect similar processes. A distinct sensitivity of MEG and EEG to the sources of cortical oscillations, a better signal-to-noise ratio of MEG, as well as strong spatial blurring of potentials in EEG are most likely the reasons for the observed differences in the effects of alcohol on spontaneous oscillations as detected with two methods.

Impairment of Neuroplasticity in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex by Alcohol.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-04764-9	Previous studies have demonstrated that alcohol consumption impairs neuroplasticity in the motor cortex. However, it is unknown whether alcohol produces a similar impairment of neuroplasticity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a brain region that plays an important role in cognitive functioning. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of alcohol intoxication on neuroplasticity in the DLPFC. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) was used for the induction and measurement of associative LTP-like neuroplasticity in the DLPFC. Fifteen healthy subjects were administered PAS to the DLPFC following consumption of an alcohol (1.5 g/l of body water) or placebo beverage in a within-subject cross-over design. PAS induced neuroplasticity was indexed up to 60 minutes following PAS. Additionally, the effect of alcohol on PAS-induced potentiation of theta-gamma coupling (an index associated with learning and memory) was examined prior to and following PAS. Alcohol consumption resulted in a significant impairment of mean (t = 2.456, df = 13, p = 0.029) and maximum potentiation (t = -2.945, df = 13, p = 0.011) compared to the placebo beverage in the DLPFC and globally. Alcohol also suppressed the potentiation of theta-gamma coupling by PAS. Findings from the present study provide a potential neurophysiological mechanism for impairment of cognitive functioning by alcohol.

Late-afternoon ethanol intake affects nocturnal sleep and the sleep EEG in middle-aged men.	DOI: 10.1097/00004714-199612000-00004	The effect of a moderate dose of ethanol (0.55 g/kg of body weight), administered 6 hours before scheduled bedtime, on performance, nocturnal sleep, and the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) was investigated in 10 healthy, middle-aged men (mean age: 61.6 +/- 0.9 years). By the beginning of the sleep episode, breath-ethanol concentrations had declined to zero in all subjects. Compared with the control condition (mineral water), sleep was perceived as more superficial. Sleep efficiency, total sleep time, stage 1, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were reduced. In the second half of the sleep episode, wakefulness exhibited a twofold increase. EEG power density in low delta frequencies was enhanced in non-REM sleep (1.25-2.5 Hz) and REM sleep (1.25-1.5 Hz). In slow wave sleep (i.e., stages 3 + 4), power density was increased not only in the low-frequency range (1.25-1.5, 2.25-4.0, 4.75-5.0 Hz) but also within the alpha (8.25-9.0 Hz) and sigma (12.25-13.0 Hz) band. The data demonstrate that late-afternoon ethanol intake in middle-aged men disrupts sleep consolidation, affects the sleep stage distribution, and alters the sleep EEG.

Alcohol reduces prefrontal cortical excitability in humans: a combined TMS and EEG study.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1300099	The effects of alcohol (0.8 g/kg) on the prefrontal cortex were studied in nine healthy subjects using the technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG). A total of 120 magnetic pulses were delivered with a figure-of-eight coil to the left prefrontal cortex at the rate of 0.4-0.7 Hz. The EEG was recorded simultaneously with 60 scalp electrodes (41 electrodes were used for analysis); the TMS-evoked activation was estimated by the area under the global mean field amplitude (GMFA) time curve. TMS caused changes in EEG activity lasting up to 270 ms poststimulus. Alcohol decreased GMFA at 30-270 ms poststimulus (713+/-303 vs 478+/-142 microV ms; p=0.007). Alcohol-induced differences were most pronounced at anterior electrodes. These results suggest that alcohol reduces the excitability in the prefrontal cortex.

The effects of ethanol on human sleep EEG power spectra differ from those of benzodiazepine receptor agonists.		A single dose of ethanol (0.60 g/kg of body weight) was administered to eight young healthy male subjects 35 minutes before bedtime. Compared to the average value of two baseline nights, subjective sleep and polysomnographically determined sleep parameters were not significantly affected. In the first 2 hours of sleep after ethanol intake, the combined value of wakefulness, stage 1, and movement time was reduced. In this interval, visually scored stage 4 sleep was increased, and electroencephalographic (EEG) power density in nonrapid-eye-movement (nonREM) sleep was enhanced in the lowest delta frequencies and reduced in the beta range. Computed for the entire sleep episode, power density in REM sleep was enhanced in some theta frequencies. In the sleep episode initiated 24 hours after ethanol intake, power density in nonREM and REM sleep was enhanced in delta and theta frequencies, and the subjectively perceived number of awakenings was reduced. The effects of ethanol on EEG power spectra during sleep differ from those published for benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics. This indicates that the effects of ethanol on the human sleep EEG are not mediated by the benzodiazepine receptor.

Specific sleepiness symptoms are indicators of performance impairment during sleep deprivation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.aap.2013.09.003	"Drivers are not always aware that they are becoming impaired as a result of sleepiness. Using specific symptoms of sleepiness might assist with recognition of drowsiness related impairment and help drivers judge whether they are safe to drive a vehicle, however this has not been evaluated. In this study, 20 healthy volunteer professional drivers completed two randomized sessions in the laboratory - one under 24h of acute sleep deprivation, and one with alcohol. The Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) and a 30min simulated driving task (AusEdTM) were performed every 3-4h in the sleep deprivation session, and at a BAC of 0.00% and 0.05% in the alcohol session, while electroencephalography (EEG) and eye movements were recorded. After each test session, drivers completed the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and the Sleepiness Symptoms Questionnaire (SSQ), which includes eight specific sleepiness and driving performance symptoms. A second baseline session was completed on a separate day by the professional drivers and in an additional 20 non-professional drivers for test-retest reliability. There was moderate test-retest agreement on the SSQ (r=0.59). Significant correlations were identified between individual sleepiness symptoms and the KSS score (r values 0.50-0.74, p<0.01 for all symptoms). The frequency of all SSQ items increased during sleep deprivation (χ(2) values of 28.4-80.2, p<0.01 for all symptoms) and symptoms were related to increased subjective sleepiness and performance deterioration. The symptoms ""struggling to keep your eyes open"", ""difficulty maintaining correct speed"", ""reactions were slow"" and ""head dropping down"" were most closely related to increased alpha and theta activity on EEG (r values 0.49-0.59, p<0.001) and ""nodding off to sleep"" and ""struggling to keep your eyes open"" were related to slow eye movements (r values 0.67 and 0.64, p<0.001). Symptoms related to visual disturbance and impaired driving performance were most accurate at detecting severely impaired driving performance (AUC on ROC curve of 0.86-0.91 for detecting change in lateral lane position greater than the change at a BAC of 0.05%). Individual sleepiness symptoms are related to impairment during acute sleep deprivation and might be able to assist drivers in recognizing their own sleepiness and ability to drive safely."

Effects of alcohol on sleep parameters of sleep-deprived healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1093/sleep/20.1.52	Both partial and total sleep deprivation frequently result in a rebound of paradoxical sleep (PS), as well as of slow-wave or delta sleep. Acute administration of ethanol inhibits PS in normal volunteers. This effect is dose-dependent and consists of increased latency to and reduced duration of paradoxical sleep. It has also been shown that PS rebound may occur on the same night, as blood alcohol concentration (BAC) declines. The present study examined the effects of sleep deprivation prior to ethanol administration on nocturnal-sleep parameters in healthy male volunteers. Polysomnograms were performed with a randomized, crossover design on baseline, placebo, post-placebo, ethanol (0.9 g/kg), and post-ethanol recovery nights. Subjects were submitted to partial (PSD) (n = 6) or total (TSD) (n = 6) sleep deprivation for 40 hours before placebo or ethanol conditions. Results evidenced a PS inhibition after ethanol treatment in both deprivation groups, despite their sleep debt (PSD, placebo = 103.7 minutes and ethanol = 72.7 minutes; TSD, placebo = 111.8 minutes and ethanol = 76.6 minutes). This inhibition was BAC-dependent and specific to PS, since delta sleep remained unaltered. These effects could be due to the reduction of cholinergic release and/or glutamatergic inhibition, both of which modulate acetylcholine release.

Serotonergic ethanol effects and auditory evoked dipole activity in alcoholic and healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1016/0165-1781(96)02796-5	Ethanol has central serotonergic effects that may be of pathogenetic importance in a subgroup of alcohol-dependent patients with a central serotonergic hypofunction. Recent results indicate that pronounced amplitude increases of auditory evoked responses (tangential dipoles, N1/P2 component) with increasing stimulus intensity (loudness) may be an indicator of such a low serotonergic neurotransmission. Because of its serotonin-agonistic effects, ethanol can be expected to decrease this intensity dependence. Twenty-eight alcoholic patients were studied both in the intoxication phase and after 1 week of withdrawal. A reduced intensity dependence of the tangential dipole activity was observed in the intoxicated state. Correspondingly, a reduction of this parameter was found in 14 healthy subjects after an ethanol load (1 g/kg, p.o.).

Acute alcohol intoxication and expectations reshape the spatiotemporal functional architecture of executive control.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116811	While the deleterious effects of acute ethyl alcohol intoxication on executive control are well-established, the underlying spatiotemporal brain mechanisms remain largely unresolved. In addition, since the effects of alcohol are noticeable to participants, isolating the effects of the substance from those related to expectations represents a major challenge. We addressed these issues using a double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled experimental design comparing the behavioral and electrical neuroimaging acute effects of 0.6 vs 0.02 ​g/kg alcohol intake recorded in 65 healthy adults during an inhibitory control Go/NoGo task. Topographic ERP analyses of covariance with self-reported dose expectations allowed to dissociate their neurophysiological effects from those of the substance. While alcohol intoxication increased response time variability and post-error slowing, bayesian analyses indicated that it did not modify commission error rates. Functionally, alcohol induced topographic ERP modulations over the periods of the stimulus-locked N2 and P3 components, arising from pre-supplementary motor and anterior cingulate areas. In contrast, alcohol decreased the strength of the response-locked anterior cingulate error-related component but not its topography. This pattern indicates that alcohol had a locally specific influence within the executive control network, but disrupted performance monitoring processes via global strength-based mechanisms. We further revealed that alcohol-related expectations induced temporally specific functional modulations of the early N2 stimulus-locked medio-lateral prefrontal activity, a processing phase preceding those influenced by the actual alcohol intake. Our collective findings thus not only reveal the mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced impairments in impulse control and error processing, but also dissociate substance- from expectations- related functional effects.

Dipole estimation of alpha EEG during alcohol ingestion in males genotypes for ALDH2.	DOI: 10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00707-4	Using a dipole tracing method based on the two-dipole model, the purpose of the present study was to investigate alcohol-induced changes in the alpha band of electroencephalogram (EEG) and its equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) in 12 healthy male volunteers, who were genetically typed for mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2). The alpha power and the mean interval dipolarity, which represents the goodness of fit of alpha EEG with the two-dipole model, increased at 30 min after 0.75 ml/kg of alcohol ingestion, when breath alcohol concentration showed its peak. However, the location of ECDs and distribution of alpha EEG did not change after alcohol ingestion. These findings indicate that alcohol enhances alpha EEG but does not change the location of its electrical sources. Interestingly, the time course of alcohol-induced EEG changes differed significantly according to the aversive flushing reaction after its intake. From 60 to 120 min, the non-flushing group which had homozygous ALDH2* 1 (active type) displayed significant increase not only in the alpha power but also in the interval dipolarity compared to the baseline, whereas the flushing group with heterozygous ALDH2*1/2*2 (inactive type) did not exhibit this significant increase. The difference in the time course was discussed from the viewpoint of the protective effect of ALDH2*2 allele against the risk for alcoholism. These results suggest that the dipole tracing method could provide an alternative neurophysiological marker for the risk for alcoholism.

The differentiated networks related to essential tremor onset and its amplitude modulation after alcohol intake.	DOI: 10.1016/j.expneurol.2017.07.013	The dysregulation of endogenous rhythms within brain networks have been implicated in a broad range of motor and non-motor pathologies. Essential tremor (ET), classically the purview of a single aberrant pacemaker, has recently become associated with network-level dysfunction across multiple brain regions. Specifically, it has been suggested that motor cortex constitutes an important node in a tremor-generating network involving the cerebellum. Yet the mechanisms by which these regions relate to tremor remain a matter of considerable debate. We sought to discriminate the contributions of cerebral and cerebellar dysregulation by combining high-density electroencephalography with subject-specific structural MRI. For that, we contrasted ET with voluntary (mimicked) tremor before and after ingestion of alcohol to regulate the tremorgenic networks. Our results demonstrate distinct loci of cortical tremor coherence, most pronounced over the sensorimotor cortices in healthy controls, but more frontal motor areas in ET-patients consistent with a heightened involvement of the supplementary motor area. We further demonstrate that the reduction in tremor amplitude associated with alcohol intake is reflected in altered cerebellar - but not cerebral - coupling with movement. Taken together, these findings implicate tremor emergence as principally associated with increases in activity within frontal motor regions, whereas modulation of the amplitude of established tremor relates to changes in cerebellar activity. These findings progress a mechanistic understanding of ET and implicate network-level vulnerabilities in the rhythmic nature of communication throughout the brain.

The effects of inhibitory control training on alcohol consumption, implicit alcohol-related cognitions and brain electrical activity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.04.011	This study aimed to replicate findings that alcohol consumption and positive implicit beer-related cognitions can be reduced using inhibitory control (IC) training, with the addition of an active training control. Frontal EEG asymmetry, an objective psychophysiological index of approach motivation, was used as a dependent measure to examine training outcomes. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two IC training conditions (Beer NoGo or Beer Go) or a Brief Alcohol Intervention (BAI) (i.e. the active training control). The IC training tasks consistently paired a stimulus that required a response with images of water (Beer NoGo) or images of beer (Beer Go). Alcohol consumption and implicit beer-related cognitions were measured at pre-training, post-training and at one week follow-up. Frontal EEG asymmetry was recorded during a passive image viewing task that presented neutral, healthy, and beer stimuli - at pre-training, post-training and follow-up. Participants in the Beer NoGo and BAI conditions consumed less beer in a taste test immediately after training than Beer Go participants, suggesting that IC training may be as effective as the already established BAI. The taste test findings were in line with the frontal EEG asymmetry data, which indicated that approach motivation for beer stimuli was altered in the expected directions. However, the positive correlation between post-training frontal EEG asymmetry data and taste test consumption was not significant. While there were no significant changes in implicit beer-related cognitions following training, a trending positive relationship between implicit beer-related cognitions at post-training and taste test consumption was reported. Further exploration addressing the limitations of the current study is required in order to clarify the implications of these findings.

Psychophysiological responses to drug-associated stimuli in chronic heavy cannabis use.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06051.x	Due to learning processes originally neutral stimuli become drug-associated and can activate an implicit drug memory, which leads to a conditioned arousing 'drug-seeking' state. This condition is accompanied by specific psychophysiological responses. The goal of the present study was the analysis of changes in cortical and peripheral reactivity to cannabis as well as alcohol-associated pictures compared with emotionally significant drug-unrelated and neutral pictures in long-term heavy cannabis users. Participants were 15 chronic heavy cannabis users and 15 healthy controls. Verbal reports as well as event-related potentials of the electroencephalogram and skin conductance responses were assessed in a cue-reactivity paradigm to determine the psychophysiological effects caused by drug-related visual stimulus material. The evaluation of self-reported craving and emotional processing showed that cannabis stimuli were perceived as more arousing and pleasant and elicited significantly more cannabis craving in cannabis users than in healthy controls. Cannabis users also demonstrated higher cannabis stimulus-induced arousal, as indicated by significantly increased skin conductance and a larger late positivity of the visual event-related brain potential. These findings support the assumption that drug-associated stimuli acquire increased incentive salience in addiction history and induce conditioned physiological patterns, which lead to craving and potentially to drug intake. The potency of visual drug-associated cues to capture attention and to activate drug-specific memory traces and accompanying physiological symptoms embedded in a cycle of abstinence and relapse--even in a 'so-called' soft drug--was assessed for the first time.

Clinical implications of the pharmacology of sertraline.	DOI: 10.1097/00004850-199112002-00004	Sertraline is slowly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations at 6-8 h. Plasma concentrations are linearly related to dose. The elimination half-life is about 32 h; metabolism is by demethylation to an inactive metabolite. Once-daily dosing is recommended, with steady state being reached after about 7 days. The kinetics of sertraline in the elderly and in patients with renal impairment are similar to those in young healthy female volunteers. In young male volunteers, peak plasma concentrations were lower, and elimination half-life shorter, than in elderly men or both groups of women. Nevertheless, no reduction in dosage is recommended for these groups. Sertraline is highly active in animal models of depression, and administration of the drug to healthy human beings causes a selective, dose-related inhibition of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) uptake into blood platelets. Single doses of sertraline in volunteers caused changes in the quantitative pharmaco-electroencephalogram suggesting antidepressant and anxiolytic actions, with sedative potential evident only at doses of 200 mg or more. Sertraline does not impair psychomotor performance, including simulated car driving, and overall seems neither stimulating nor sedating: an increase in critical flicker fusion threshold suggests a slight alerting effect, whereas subjective tests indicate an increase in perceived sedation at doses of 100 mg or more. No potentiation of the effects of ethanol has been noted in either young or elderly subjects. No adverse effects on the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, or systolic time intervals have been detected, and sertraline lacks anticholinergic action. These studies imply a low probability of adverse central nervous and cardiovascular effects. Sertraline is probably a weak inducer of hepatic microsomal enzyme activity. Sertraline does not affect the clearance of lithium but there may be a pharmacodynamic interaction which leads to increased tremor when the drugs are given together. No clinically relevant effects were noted in the interaction studies with digoxin, atenolol and diazepam. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sertraline are generally favourable. However, caution is needed when sertraline is given to patients receiving lithium or drugs with a low therapeutic ratio, such as corticosteroids, oral hypoglycaemic agents, and warfarin.

A comparison of the central nervous system effects of alcohol at pseudo-steady state in Caucasian and expatriate Japanese healthy male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/j.alcohol.2012.06.004	In general, Japanese and Caucasians differ in their response to alcohol. To investigate these differences the alcohol clamping method can be used. This strictly controlled infusion regimen provides a reliable tool to study contrasts in central nervous system (CNS) effects and/or alcohol disposition. In this study, twelve Japanese and twelve Caucasian healthy volunteers received two concentrations of intravenous alcohol or placebo using the alcohol clamp. Infusion rates during the steady state phase were used to compare alcohol clearance between the subgroups. Central nervous system (CNS) effects were frequently measured throughout the clamp. On average, significantly lower amounts of alcohol were needed to maintain similar stable concentrations in the Japanese group. However, these differences disappeared when values were corrected for lean body mass. The most pronounced pharmacodynamic differences between the groups were observed on body sway and on the visual analogue scale for subjective alcohol effects, mainly at the highest dose level. The alcohol clamp seems a useful method to compare differences in alcohol metabolism between groups. Some CNS effects of alcohol differed clearly between Japanese and Caucasians, but others did not, even though alcohol levels were stable and similar between the two groups.

Alcohol affects the brain's resting-state network in social drinkers.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048641	Acute alcohol intake is known to enhance inhibition through facilitation of GABA(A) receptors, which are present in 40% of the synapses all over the brain. Evidence suggests that enhanced GABAergic transmission leads to increased large-scale brain connectivity. Our hypothesis is that acute alcohol intake would increase the functional connectivity of the human brain resting-state network (RSN). To test our hypothesis, electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements were recorded from healthy social drinkers at rest, during eyes-open and eyes-closed sessions, after administering to them an alcoholic beverage or placebo respectively. Salivary alcohol and cortisol served to measure the inebriation and stress levels. By calculating Magnitude Square Coherence (MSC) on standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA) solutions, we formed cortical networks over several frequency bands, which were then analyzed in the context of functional connectivity and graph theory. MSC was increased (p<0.05, corrected with False Discovery Rate, FDR corrected) in alpha, beta (eyes-open) and theta bands (eyes-closed) following acute alcohol intake. Graph parameters were accordingly altered in these bands quantifying the effect of alcohol on the structure of brain networks; global efficiency and density were higher and path length was lower during alcohol (vs. placebo, p<0.05). Salivary alcohol concentration was positively correlated with the density of the network in beta band. The degree of specific nodes was elevated following alcohol (vs. placebo). Our findings support the hypothesis that short-term inebriation considerably increases large-scale connectivity in the RSN. The increased baseline functional connectivity can -at least partially- be attributed to the alcohol-induced disruption of the delicate balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission in favor of inhibitory influences. Thus, it is suggested that short-term inebriation is associated, as expected, to increased GABA transmission and functional connectivity, while long-term alcohol consumption may be linked to exactly the opposite effect.

The effects of nefazodone, imipramine and placebo, alone and combined with alcohol, in normal subjects.	DOI: 10.1097/00004850-199300810-00002	Nefazodone (200 mg, 400 mg/day) imipramine (150 mg/day) and placebo were administered to 12 normal, healthy volunteer subjects for a period of 8 days each. A measured dose of alcohol was consumed with the drug on day 8. A battery of physiological, psychomotor, cognitive and subjective tests was carried out before drug administration and 2 h after drug administration on days 1, 7, and 8. Nefazodone had little effect on heart rate and blood pressure whereas imipramine increased both heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. Nefazodone 400 mg impaired the critical flicker fusion threshold. Dose-dependent improvements in psychomotor performance (Gibson Spiral Maze) and complex memory performance (learning, pursuit rotor, and visual working memory) were produced by nefazodone while imipramine administration impaired performance on these tasks. Subjective changes in alertness and bodily symptoms were produced by all active compounds. While nefazodone failed to potentiate the sedative-hypnotic (depressant) effects of alcohol, imipramine tended to enhance them for psychomotor performance, memory assessments, and some subjective ratings. Thus, nefazodone, particularly at lower dose levels, causes less disruption of human performance than imipramine. This effect probably reflects the lack of anticholinergic activity of nefazodone. Also, nefazodone failed to potentiate the depressant effects of alcohol, perhaps because of its minimal alpha-blockade.

Altered oscillatory brain dynamics of emotional processing in young binge drinkers.	DOI: 10.3758/s13415-017-0551-7	Heavy episodic drinking, also termed binge drinking, is commonly practiced by young adults. It is accompanied by a range of cognitive, affective, and social problems, but the neural dynamics underlying changes in emotional functions is poorly understood. To investigate the behavioral and brain indices of affective processing as a function of binge drinking, young, healthy participants (23.3 ± 3.3 years) were assigned to two groups (n = 32 each) based on their drinking habits. Binge drinking (BD) participants reported drinking heavily with at least five binge episodes in the last 6 months, whereas light drinkers (LD) reported no more than one binge episode in the last 6 months. Participants provided subjective ratings of emotionally evocative images with negative, positive, erotic, and neutral themes mostly selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Electroencephalography (EEG) signal was recorded with a 64-channel system and analyzed in theta frequency band (4-7 Hz) with Morlet wavelets. Subjective ratings of the IAPS pictures were equivalent across both groups. However, affective modulation of event-related theta power both during early appraisal and later integrative processing stages was attenuated in BD, particularly those engaging in high-intensity drinking. These findings suggest that binge drinking is associated with altered neurophysiological indices of affective functions that are reflected in lower theta responsivity to emotions. The blunted long-range cortico-cortical and corticolimbic integration is consistent with compromised affective functions in alcohol use disorder. These findings may have implications for diagnostic and intervention strategies in heavy alcohol users.

Neuronal oscillations and functional interactions between resting state networks.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.22418	Functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) studies showed that resting state activity in the healthy brain is organized into multiple large-scale networks encompassing distant regions. A key finding of resting state fMRI studies is the anti-correlation typically observed between the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default mode network (DMN), which - during task performance - are activated and deactivated, respectively. Previous studies have suggested that alcohol administration modulates the balance of activation/deactivation in brain networks, as well as it induces significant changes in oscillatory activity measured by electroencephalography (EEG). However, our knowledge of alcohol-induced changes in band-limited EEG power and their potential link with the functional interactions between DAN and DMN is still very limited. Here we address this issue, examining the neuronal effects of alcohol administration during resting state by using simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Our findings show increased EEG power in the theta frequency band (4-8 Hz) after administration of alcohol compared to placebo, which was prominent over the frontal cortex. More interestingly, increased frontal tonic EEG activity in this band was associated with greater anti-correlation between the DAN and the frontal component of the DMN. Furthermore, EEG theta power and DAN-DMN anti-correlation were relatively greater in subjects who reported a feeling of euphoria after alcohol administration, which may result from a diminished inhibition exerted by the prefrontal cortex. Overall, our findings suggest that slow brain rhythms are responsible for dynamic functional interactions between brain networks. They also confirm the applicability and potential usefulness of EEG-fMRI for central nervous system drug research.

EEG topography of acute ethanol effects in resting and activated normals.	DOI: 10.15288/jsa.1994.55.645	Acute effects of ethanol on spectral characteristics of the EEG were studied using 18 recording sites and topographic mapping. The EEG was recorded both at rest and during a mental arithmetic task. Healthy young male volunteers were randomly assigned to an ethanol (n = 22) or a placebo (n = 15) group. The ethanol group received a total dose of 1.0 g/kg, divided into two equal doses given 75 minutes apart. and measurement sessions took place at baseline and after each dose. The placebo group underwent a similar schedule. Power in the theta, alpha and beta bands all increased in the ethanol group, but only the theta and beta bands clearly separated ethanol from placebo. Alpha increases were seen in the placebo group as well. The ethanol-induced changes were greater in the left hemisphere than in the right, having the effect of attenuating the right-over-left asymmetry seen at baseline. Differences between ethanol and placebo were more marked in the mentally activated condition, since the changes seen at rest were inhibited by the activation in the placebo group, but not in the ethanol group. The results indicate (1) that ethanol induces a less differentiated pattern of activity within the brain at rest, and (2) that it impairs the capacity to activate the brain under the challenge of a mental task.

COVID-19 pandemic stressors are associated with reported increases in frequency of drunkenness among individuals with a history of alcohol use disorder.	DOI: 10.1038/s41398-023-02577-1	Some sources report increases in alcohol use have been observed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among women. Cross-sectional studies suggest that specific COVID-19-related stressful experiences (e.g., social disconnection) may be driving such increases in the general population. Few studies have explored these topics among individuals with a history of Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD), an especially vulnerable population. Drawing on recent data collected by the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA; COVID-19 study N = 1651, 62% women, age range: 30-91) in conjunction with AUD history data collected on the sample since 1990, we investigated associations of COVID-19 related stressors and coping activities with changes in drunkenness frequency since the start of the pandemic. Analyses were conducted for those without a history of AUD (N: 645) and three groups of participants with a history of AUD prior to the start of the pandemic: (1) those experiencing AUD symptoms (N: 606), (2) those in remission who were drinking (N: 231), and (3) those in remission who were abstinent (had not consumed alcohol for 5+ years; N: 169). Gender-stratified models were also examined. Exploratory analyses examined the moderating effects of 'problematic alcohol use' polygenic risk scores (PRS) and neural connectivity (i.e., posterior interhemispheric alpha EEG coherence) on associations between COVID-19 stressors and coping activities with changes in the frequency of drunkenness. Increases in drunkenness frequency since the start of the pandemic were higher among those with a lifetime AUD diagnosis experiencing symptoms prior to the start of the pandemic (14% reported increased drunkenness) when compared to those without a history of AUD (5% reported increased drunkenness). Among individuals in remission from AUD prior to the start of the pandemic, rates of increased drunkenness were 10% for those who were drinking pre-pandemic and 4% for those who had previously been abstinent. Across all groups, women reported nominally greater increases in drunkenness frequency when compared with men, although only women experiencing pre-pandemic AUD symptoms reported significantly greater rates of increased drunkenness since the start of the pandemic compared to men in this group (17% of women vs. 5% of men). Among those without a prior history of AUD, associations between COVID-19 risk and protective factors with increases in drunkenness frequency were not observed. Among all groups with a history of AUD (including those with AUD symptoms and those remitted from AUD), perceived stress was associated with increases in drunkenness. Among the remitted-abstinent group, essential worker status was associated with increases in drunkenness. Gender differences in these associations were observed: among women in the remitted-abstinent group, essential worker status, perceived stress, media consumption, and decreased social interactions were associated with increases in drunkenness. Among men in the remitted-drinking group, perceived stress was associated with increases in drunkenness, and increased relationship quality was associated with decreases in drunkenness. Exploratory analyses indicated that associations between family illness or death with increases in drunkenness and increased relationship quality with decreases in drunkenness were more pronounced among the remitted-drinking participants with higher PRS. Associations between family illness or death, media consumption, and economic hardships with increases in drunkenness and healthy coping with decreases in drunkenness were more pronounced among the remitted-abstinent group with lower interhemispheric alpha EEG connectivity. Our results demonstrated that only individuals with pre-pandemic AUD symptoms reported greater increases in drunkenness frequency since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those without a lifetime history of AUD. This increase was more pronounced among women than men in this group. However, COVID-19-related stressors and coping activities were associated with changes in the frequency of drunkenness among all groups of participants with a prior history of AUD, including those experiencing AUD symptoms, as well as abstinent and non-abstinent participants in remission. Perceived stress, essential worker status, media consumption, social connections (especially for women), and relationship quality (especially for men) are specific areas of focus for designing intervention and prevention strategies aimed at reducing pandemic-related alcohol misuse among this particularly vulnerable group. Interestingly, these associations were not observed for individuals without a prior history of AUD, supporting prior literature that demonstrates that widespread stressors (e.g., pandemics, terrorist attacks) disproportionately impact the mental health and alcohol use of those with a prior history of problems.

Alcohol-induced deficits in reactive control of response selection and inhibition are counteracted by a seemingly paradox increase in proactive control.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-28012-5	High-dose alcohol intoxication reduces cognitive control, including inhibition. Although inhibition deficits may contribute to the behavioral deficits commonly observed in alcohol use disorder (AUD), many questions about potentially modulating factors have remained unanswered. We examined the effects of experimentally induced high-dose alcohol intoxication (~ 1.1 ‰) on the interplay between controlled vs. automatic response selection and inhibition in healthy young men. A holistic EEG-based theta activity analysis that considered both reactive control during task performance and preceding proactive control processes was run. It revealed a previously unknown seesaw relationship, with decreased reactive control, but paradoxically increased proactive control. Most importantly, alcohol-induced increases in proactive occipital theta band power were associated with reductions in negative alcohol effects on reactive control processes associated with decreased activity in the SMA and medial frontal cortex. Our findings demonstrate that research should not solely focus on immediate effects during task performance. Aside from differential neurobiochemical and neuroanatomical effects of alcohol, it is also conceivable that proactive control may have been recruited in a (secondary) response to compensate for alcohol-induced impairments in reactive control. Against this background, it could be promising to investigate changes in such compensatory mechanisms in pronounced alcohol-associated inhibition deficits, like in AUD patients.

The interactions of ethanol with single and repeated doses of suriclone and diazepam on physiological and psychomotor functions in normal subjects.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00314858	The effects of diazepam (5 mg t.i.d.), suriclone (0.2 and 0.4 mg t.i.d.) and placebo (t.i.d.) were assessed in 12 normal, healthy volunteer subjects after a single dose and after treatment for a period of 8 days. A battery of physiological, psychomotor and subjective tests was administered on days 1 and 8 both before and after drug and after a measured dose of ethanol. The effects of diazepam on the EEG were characteristic of benzodiazepines-a decrease in the slow frequency wave-bands, an increase in fast frequency wave-band and diminished evoked response amplitude. Suriclone had similar effects on fast frequency activity and evoked response amplitude but, in contrast to diazepam, also increased the slow frequency wave-bands after 7 days treatment. Some improvements in performance were seen with suriclone on critical flicker fusion, tapping speed, spiral maze and digit cancellation. In contrast, suriclone impaired performance to a greater extent than diazepam on digit symbol substitution and symbol copying. Body sway was also enhanced by suriclone to a greater extent than diazepam. Subjective ratings for mood and adverse-effects showed few differences between suriclone or diazepam. However, suriclone caused greater gastro-intestinal disturbances than diazepam, especially after ethanol, and subjects rated themselves as more antagonistic and more irritable on suriclone. Ratings for calmness suggested that in contrast to diazepam, suriclone had no anxiolytic effect. Several of the parameters tested showed a build up of effect with diazepam over the treatment period which was not seen with suriclone. It is suggested that this difference may be due to differences in elimination rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Affectdrug effects', 'Anti-Anxiety Agentsadministration & dosagepharmacology', 'Diazepamadministration & dosagepharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Ethanolpharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Naphthyridines', 'Ovumdrug effects', 'Piperazinesadministration & dosagepharmacology', 'Psychomotor Performancedrug effects', 'Reaction Timedrug effects', 'Sulfur Compounds']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1351467/	['Ethanol', 'Benzodiazepine', 'Piperazine', 'Suriclone']	[702, 134664, 4837, 40903]	1351467	['1992']

The diversity of seizures related to alcohol use. A study of consecutive patients.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1468-1331.1999.660697.x	The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of hazardous alcohol drinking on the occurrence of epileptic seizures, the semiology of such seizures, and the extent of the problem. A consecutive sample of 142 acute seizure patients (78 male and 64 female, mean age 46 (16-79) years) was studied. Control groups were 185 consecutive sciatica patients and 254 healthy individuals. Subjects with a hazardous alcohol drinking level were identified by a score >8 in the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Seizures in AUDIT-positive individuals occurring within 72 h of the last drink were considered to be related to alcohol withdrawal. Generalized or partial onset seizures were classified on the basis of history, electroencephalographic (EEG) and neuroradiological findings. Thirty-five percent of seizure patients were AUDIT-positive, whereas conversely 27% were abstainers. Two-thirds of AUDIT-positive seizure patients met the criteria for withdrawal seizures. Indications of partial onset seizures were found in 25 (51%) of AUDIT-positive patients, all secondarily generalized seizures. Sixty percent of generalized onset seizure patients were AUDIT-positive. In conclusion, seizure patients included significantly more AUDIT-positive subjects, as well as abstainers, than healthy Norwegian controls and consecutive sciatica patients from our hospital. Partial onset seizures are more frequent among hazardous drinkers than hitherto recognized. A generalized onset seizure in adults warrants a high suspicion of alcohol as a provoking factor. Routine screening of acute seizure admissions with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test is recommended.

Alcohol Impairs N100 Response to Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Stimulation.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-21457-z	Alcohol is thought to exert its effect by acting on gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) inhibitory neurotransmission. The N100, the negative peak on electroencephalography (EEG) that occurs approximately 100 ms following the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, is believed to represent GABAB receptor mediated neurotransmission. However, no studies have examined the effect of alcohol on the N100 response to TMS stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In the present study, we aimed to explore the effect of alcohol on the DLPFC TMS-evoked N100 response. The study was a within-subject cross-over design study. Fifteen healthy alcohol drinkers were administered TMS to the DLPFC before (PreBev) and after consumption (PostBev) of an alcohol or placebo beverage. The amplitude of the N100 before and after beverage was compared for both the alcohol and placebo beverage. Alcohol produced a significant decrease in N100 amplitude (t = 4.316, df = 14, p = 0.001). The placebo beverage had no effect on the N100 amplitude (t = -1.856, df = 14, p = 0.085). Acute alcohol consumption produces a decrease in N100 amplitude to TMS stimulation of the DLPFC, suggesting a decrease in GABAB receptor mediated neurotransmission. Findings suggest that the N100 may represent a marker of alcohol's effects on inhibitory neurotransmission.

Quantitative electroencephalographic analysis of delirium tremens development following alcohol-withdrawal seizure based on a small number of male cases.

High-dose ethanol intoxication decreases 1/f neural noise or scale-free neural activity in the resting state.	DOI: 10.1111/adb.12818	"Binge drinking is a frequent phenomenon in many western societies and has been associated with an increased risk of developing alcohol use disorder later in life. Yet, the effects of high-dose alcohol intoxication on neurophysiological processes are still quite poorly understood. This is particularly the case given that neurophysiological brain activity not only contains recurring (oscillatory) patterns of activity, but also a significant fraction of ""scale-free"" or arrhythmic dynamics referred to as 1/f type activity, pink noise, or 1/f neural noise. Neurobiological considerations suggest that it should be modulated by alcohol intoxication. To investigate this assumption, we collected resting state EEG data from n = 23 healthy young male subjects in a crossover design, where each subject was once tested sober and once tested while intoxicated (mean breath alcohol concentration of 1.1 permille ±0.2). Analyses of the 1/f neural dynamics showed that ethanol intoxication decreased resting state 1/f neural noise, as compared with a sober state. The effects were strongest when the eyes were closed and particularly reliable in the beta frequency band. Given that the dynamics of the beta band have been shown to strongly depend on GABAA receptor neural transmission, this finding nicely aligns with the fact that ethanol increases GABAergic signaling. The study reveals a currently unreported effect of binge drinking on neurophysiological dynamics, which likely revealed a higher sensitivity for ethanol effects than most commonly considered measures of power in neural oscillations. Implications and applicability of these findings are discussed."

Ethanol modulates cortical activity: direct evidence with combined TMS and EEG.	DOI: 10.1006/nimg.2001.0849	The motor cortex of 10 healthy subjects was stimulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after ethanol challenge (0.8 g/kg resulting in blood concentration of 0.77 +/- 0.14 ml/liter). The electrical brain activity resulting from the brief electromagnetic pulse was recorded with high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) and located using inversion algorithms. Focal magnetic pulses to the left motor cortex were delivered with a figure-of-eight coil at the random interstimulus interval of 1.5-2.5 s. The stimulation intensity was adjusted to the motor threshold of abductor digiti minimi. Two conditions before and after ethanol ingestion (30 min) were applied: (1) real TMS, with the coil pressed against the scalp; and (2) control condition, with the coil separated from the scalp by a 2-cm-thick piece of plastic. A separate EMG control recording of one subject during TMS was made with two bipolar platinum needle electrodes inserted to the left temporal muscle. In each condition, 120 pulses were delivered. The EEG was recorded from 60 scalp electrodes. A peak in the EEG signals was observed at 43 ms after the TMS pulse in the real-TMS condition but not in the control condition or in the control scalp EMG. Potential maps before and after ethanol ingestion were significantly different from each other (P = 0.01), but no differences were found in the control condition. Ethanol changed the TMS-evoked potentials over right frontal and left parietal areas, the underlying effect appearing to be largest in the right prefrontal area. Our findings suggest that ethanol may have changed the functional connectivity between prefrontal and motor cortices. This new noninvasive method provides direct evidence about the modulation of cortical connectivity after ethanol challenge.

Forty-eight healthy volunteers were assigned randomly to 4 independent groups who received: alprazolam and placebo drink, alprazolam and alcohol, placebo capsule and alcohol, placebo capsule and placebo drink respectively. Alprazolam decreased the amplitudes of the 3 potentials of the evoked response, decreased activity in the 8-13 Hz and increased activity in the 13.5-26 Hz wavebands of the EEG and decreased the frequency at which fusion was perceived.

Theta oscillations are sensitive to both early and late conflict processing stages: effects of alcohol intoxication.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043957	Prior neuroimaging evidence indicates that decision conflict activates medial and lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices. Theoretical accounts of cognitive control highlight anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a central node in this network. However, a better understanding of the relative primacy and functional contributions of these areas to decision conflict requires insight into the neural dynamics of successive processing stages including conflict detection, response selection and execution. Moderate alcohol intoxication impairs cognitive control as it interferes with the ability to inhibit dominant, prepotent responses when they are no longer correct. To examine the effects of moderate intoxication on successive processing stages during cognitive control, spatio-temporal changes in total event-related theta power were measured during Stroop-induced conflict. Healthy social drinkers served as their own controls by participating in both alcohol (0.6 g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55 g/kg women) and placebo conditions in a counterbalanced design. Anatomically-constrained magnetoencephalography (aMEG) approach was applied to complex power spectra for theta (4-7 Hz) frequencies. The principal generator of event-related theta power to conflict was estimated to ACC, with contributions from fronto-parietal areas. The ACC was uniquely sensitive to conflict during both early conflict detection, and later response selection and execution stages. Alcohol attenuated theta power to conflict across successive processing stages, suggesting that alcohol-induced deficits in cognitive control may result from theta suppression in the executive network. Slower RTs were associated with attenuated theta power estimated to ACC, indicating that alcohol impairs motor preparation and execution subserved by the ACC. In addition to their relevance for the currently prevailing accounts of cognitive control, our results suggest that alcohol-induced impairment of top-down strategic processing underlies poor self-control and inability to refrain from drinking.

Effects of loratadine and cetirizine on actual driving and psychometric test performance, and EEG during driving.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00280119	Sixteen healthy male and female volunteers took part in a 6-way, double-blind cross-over trial to compare the effects of single doses of cetirizine 10 mg, loratadine 10 mg and placebo, with and without alcohol (0.72 g.kg-1, lean body mass). Performance was measured in two repetitions of a psychometric test battery, and a standard, over-the-road driving test. EEG was also measured during driving. Alcohol significantly affected almost every performance measure and altered the EEG energy spectrum during driving whilst the blood concentrations declined from 0.37 to 0.20 mg.ml-1. The effects of cetirizine of on driving performance resembled those of alcohol. It caused the subjects to operate with significantly greater variability in speed and lateral position ('weaving' motion). The effects of alcohol and cetirizine appeared to be additive. Certain cetirizine-placebo differences in subjective feelings and test battery performance were also significant. Loratadine had no significant effect on any performance parameter. It was concluded that cetirizine, but not loratadine, generally caused mild impairment of performance after a single 10 mg dose.

Combined effects of methanol and ethanol on event-related potentials in non alcohol dependent men.		The effects of consumption of the beverage got by distillation of Elaeis quineensis on brain functions were investigated in ten healthy, non-alcoholic men. Each subject ingested 979 mg ethanol and 21 mg methanol/kg body weight. N1, P2 and P3 components of the event-related potentials (ERP's) were recorded during a go/no go task before, 60 and 240 min. after alcohol ingestion. Subjects were presented paired auditory stimuli--standard (60%) and target stimuli in a random order and were asked to detect and signal the target unconditional stimulus by pressing a push button. In the trials 60 min. after alcohol P3 was smaller than control, both N1 and P2 were flatter 240 min. after dosing, whereas P3 amplitude was not changed then. The results are consistent with ERP's changes in chronic alcoholics and suggest that a low dose of methyl alcohol may increase ethanol effects in non alcohol-dependent man.

How high-dose alcohol intoxication affects the interplay of automatic and controlled processes.	DOI: 10.1111/adb.12700	"Binge drinking is an increasingly prevalent pattern of alcohol consumption that impairs top-down cognitive control to a much stronger degree than automatic response generation. Even though an imbalance of those two antagonistic processes fosters the development and maintenance of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), it has never been directly investigated how binge drinking affects the interaction of those two processes. We therefore assessed a sample of n = 35 healthy young men who were asked to perform a newly developed Simon Nogo paradigm once sober and once intoxicated (~1.2‰) in a balanced within-subject design. Additionally, an EEG was recorded to dissociate controlled and automatic cognitive subprocesses. The results demonstrate that alcohol seems to reduce top-down cognitive control. This control impairment was associated with changes in S-R mapping (reflected by a reduced parietal P3 amplitude), top-down response selection (reflected by modulations of lateralized readiness potentials), and (the evaluation of) response inhibition (reflected by modulations of the Nogo P3). In sharp contrast to this, automatic processing does not seem to be equally altered, as we found neither increases nor decreases in this domain. Most importantly, we also found that the interaction between control and automatisms might be less impaired by alcohol than control alone, which may help to overcome alcohol-induced response inhibition deficits. These ""carryover"" effects of control from one domain to the other could potentially prove beneficial in AUDs."

Ethanol-induced alterations in electroencephalographic activity in adult males.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.1993.36	The present investigation examined the effects of placebo (P), low-dose (LD), and high-dose (HD) ethanol on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in 21 healthy, adult males (X = 22.7 years). Only one condition (P, LD, or HD) was presented per day and the condition order was randomized. For each subject, blood-alcohol levels measured via breathalyzer and EEG activity, using the entire 10/20 International System, were recorded both prior to and at intervals of 35, 70, 105, and 140 minutes after P, LD, or HD administration. The Fast Fourier Transform was used to calculate power spectral densities for each EEG recording. Measures of the relative areas under the power spectral curve were made for each of the following frequency bands: slow alpha (7.5 to 10 Hz); fast alpha (10.5 to 13.0 Hz); slow beta (13.5 to 19.5 Hz); and fast beta (20 to 26 Hz) at electrodes F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, and O2. Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance performed on normalized relative area values revealed that ethanol had significant effects on EEG activity at anterior sites: frontal (F3, F4) and central (C3, C4) that presented as increased activity in the slow alpha frequency band. These results suggest a differential responsivity of both cortical region and EEG frequency band to the effects of ethanol ingestion.

Early evening low alcohol intake also worsens sleepiness-related driving impairment.	DOI: 10.1002/hup.691	Following night-time sleep restriction, afternoon driving performance during the bi-circadian surge in afternoon sleepiness is markedly worsened by blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) well under most national driving limits. This study assessed how driving with this same sleep restriction and BACs (av 40 mg and 28 mg alcohol/100 ml blood at the beginning and end of drive, respectively) respond during the evening circadian rise in alertness. In a 2 x 2 (alcohol versus control drink [double blind] x normal night sleep versus sleep restricted), repeated-measures design, eight healthy young men drove for 2 h from 18:00 h, in a real-car simulator, on a monotonous, simulated highway. Driving impairment (lane drifting), subjective sleepiness and EEG measures of sleepiness were recorded. While sleep restriction alone produced significant impairments to evening driving and subjective sleepiness, alcohol alone did not. However, alcohol combined with sleep restriction significantly worsened all indices, although, this was less than that found for afternoon driving with identical interventions. Whereas low BACs may not affect driving in normally alert drivers in the early evening, the addition of moderate sleep restriction still produces a dangerous combination. Probably, there is no 'safe' level of alcohol intake for otherwise sleepy drivers, at any time of the day.

Test-retest reliability of chemosensory evoked potentials.	DOI: 10.1097/00004691-200304000-00008	This study investigated the test-retest reliability of chemosensory event-related potentials in humans. Olfactory event-related potentials and chemosomatosensory event-related potentials were evaluated in 20 healthy, normosmic subjects. Phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA, 40% v/v) and H(2)S (4 ppm) served as olfactory stimuli whereas CO(2) (60% v/v) was the chemosomatosensory stimulus. Fifteen stimuli of each compound were applied to each nostril. Identical stimulation sequences were used during three test sessions. Sessions 1 and 2 were separated by a mean of 6.8 days; sessions 2 and 3 by 12.5 days. Electroencephalographic recordings were made from Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, and C4. Amplitudes and latencies of P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 were measured. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to test the test-retest reliability, and the general linear model examined the differences. Most correlations ranged between 0.4 < r < 0.75. Latencies correlated significantly better (P = 0.008) between sessions than amplitudes, even though with CO(2) stimulus amplitudes correlated significantly better than with PEA (P = 0.006) or H(2)S (P = 0.003). No differences arose between measurements from different nostrils for any stimulus. Chemosensory event-related potentials show good test-retest reliability. Carbon dioxide amplitudes exhibit better signal-to-noise ratios than PEA or H(2)S amplitudes. Chemosensory event-related potentials are a clinically valuable objective and are reproducible.

Simple reaction time event-related potentials: effects of alcohol and diazepam.	DOI: 10.1016/0278-5846(94)90091-4	Acute effects of alcohol and diazepam on reaction time (RT) and event-related potential (ERP) measures were examined in 108 healthy male volunteers. The subjects engaged in a simple RT task at two levels of stimulus intensity during baseline and treatment sessions. Lower stimulus intensity produced increased RT's, increased ERP peak latencies, and suppression of peak amplitudes. Moderate and high doses of alcohol, and high doses of diazepam produced increased RT's. Alcohol suppressed P100 and N100 amplitudes, while diazepam suppressed P100 amplitudes only. P100 amplitudes were correlated to RT's under baseline and treatment conditions. These results were taken as evidence for impaired stimulus detection during alcohol and diazepam intoxication, with both drugs influencing sensory-perceptual processes and alcohol alone influencing the degree of attentiveness.

The polymorphism GABABR1 T1974C[rs29230] of the GABAB receptor gene is not associated with the diagnosis of alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal seizures.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2006.00013.x	As the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulates ethanol consumption, alcohol withdrawal symptoms and seizure generation by interacting with the GABAB receptor, the genes encoding for the GABAB receptor can be considered as candidate genes for alcoholism and alcohol withdrawal seizures (AWS). As the polymorphism GABABR1 T1974C[rs29230] of the GABAB receptor gene had been associated with alcoholism and EEG abnormalities in prior studies, the present examination investigated if the polymorphism is associated with the diagnosis of alcoholism or AWS. After genotyping the allele and genotype frequencies of a group of alcoholics with a history of AWS (n = 69) were compared with the results of a group of alcoholics with only mild withdrawal symptoms (n = 97). Additionally a group of healthy controls (n = 101) was compared with individuals with the diagnosis of alcoholism (n = 220). As no significant differences were found between the compared groups, this study gave no further evidence for GABABR1 T1974C[rs29230] as a candidate for alcoholism or AWS.

Alcohol continues to affect sleepiness related driving impairment, when breath alcohol levels have fallen to near-zero.	DOI: 10.1002/hup.601	Epidemiological findings point to very low blood alcohol levels heightening the risk of sleep-related fatal road crashes. This was further assessed using a full sized interactive car simulator. Twenty, sleep restricted, healthy young men underwent a 2 h simulated afternoon monotonous drive, having previously consumed nil alcohol or 3 units >90 min previously, and having near-zero breath alcohol (BrACs) at the start of the drive. In a repeated measures, double-blind, balanced design, driving performance, subjective sleepiness and EEG were monitored throughout. Compared with nil alcohol, the alcohol condition initially increased sleepiness-related driving impairment. However, this was not mirrored by subjective sleepiness or EEG. An unexpected reversal (i.e. improvement) in driving impairment occurred with the alcohol group, in the second hour of the drive. This was supported by a trend for improved subjective alertness. Alcohol continued to interact with sleepiness-related driving impairment after BrACs had reached zero. However, a lack of subjective perception of increased sleepiness, at this time, further points to the dangerous combination of even modest alcohol intake and sleepiness, and confirms the road crash findings. BrACs are a poor guide to driver impairment.

Influence of Airflow Rate and Stimulus Concentration on Olfactory Event-Related Potentials (OERP) in Humans.	DOI: 10.1093/chemse/bjx072	Although the association between odor concentration and olfactory event-related potential (OERP) has been studied, less is known about the influence of airflow on OERP. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of airflow rate and stimulus concentration on OERP in humans. Electroencephalogram data were collected from young healthy volunteers (n = 17) in separate sessions where 2-phenylethanol (PEA) was delivered in the following conditions: 8 L/min 50% v/v, 8 L/min 30% v/v, 4 L/min 100% v/v, and 4 L/min 60%v/v. Odor concentrations are referred to the %v/v achieved with air dilution and was not measured in the nose. Odor intensity ratings were recorded immediately after stimulus presentation. Data recorded at 5 electrodes (Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, and C4) were pooled and analyzed using both time-domain averaging and single-trial time-frequency domain approaches. Higher airflow rate significantly increased intensity ratings (F = 10.98, P < 0.01), and improved the signal-to-noise-ratio (F = 5.42, P = 0.025). Results from time-frequency analysis showed higher concentration versus lower concentration increased brain oscillations in the slow frequency band (1-3 Hz) at 0-600 ms; while higher airflow rates versus lower airflow rate increased theta-band oscillations (300-600 ms and 5-9 Hz) and decreased delta-band oscillations at 900-1500 ms after stimulus onset. In conclusion, compared to stimulus concentration, airflow rate was associated with improved OERP quality and more pronounced responses. The results suggest that intensity ratings and OERP are strongly related to the steepness of stimulus onset. High airflow rates are suggested for odor delivery in order to record OERP.

Effect of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol on nocturnal sleep and early-morning behavior in young adults.	DOI: 10.1097/01.jcp.0000125688.05091.8f	The effects of cannabis extracts on nocturnal sleep, early-morning performance, memory, and sleepiness were studied in 8 healthy volunteers (4 males, 4 females; 21 to 34 years). The study was double-blind and placebo-controlled with a 4-way crossover design. The 4 treatments were placebo, 15 mg Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), 5 mg THC combined with 5 mg cannabidiol (CBD), and 15 mg THC combined with 15 mg CBD. These were formulated in 50:50 ethanol to propylene glycol and administered using an oromucosal spray during a 30-minute period from 10 pm. The electroencephalogram was recorded during the sleep period (11 pm to 7 am). Performance, sleep latency, and subjective assessments of sleepiness and mood were measured from 8:30 am (10 hours after drug administration). There were no effects of 15 mg THC on nocturnal sleep. With the concomitant administration of the drugs (5 mg THC and 5 mg CBD to 15 mg THC and 15 mg CBD), there was a decrease in stage 3 sleep, and with the higher dose combination, wakefulness was increased. The next day, with 15 mg THC, memory was impaired, sleep latency was reduced, and the subjects reported increased sleepiness and changes in mood. With the lower dose combination, reaction time was faster on the digit recall task, and with the higher dose combination, subjects reported increased sleepiness and changes in mood. Fifteen milligrams THC would appear to be sedative, while 15 mg CBD appears to have alerting properties as it increased awake activity during sleep and counteracted the residual sedative activity of 15 mg THC.

Tracking the cognitive pharmacodynamics of psychoactive substances with combinations of behavioral and neurophysiological measures.	DOI: 10.1016/S0893-133X(01)00300-1	Many common pharmacological treatments have effects on cognitive ability. Psychometric task batteries used to characterize such effects do not provide direct information about treatment-related changes in brain function. Since overt task performance reflects motivation and effort as well as ability, behavioral measures alone may overestimate or underestimate the impact of a pharmacological intervention on brain function. Here we present a method that combines behavioral and neurophysiological measures in an attempt to detect the psychoactive effects of pharmacological treatments with greater sensitivity than that provided by behavioral measures alone. Initial application of the method is made to the data from a double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in which caffeine, diphenhydramine, and alcohol were used to alter the mental state of 16 healthy subjects at rest and while they performed low load and high load versions of a working memory task. For each intervention, more sensitive detection of drug or alcohol effects over a four hour period was obtained when EEG variables were included in multivariate analyses than when only behavioral variables were used. These initial results suggest that it can be useful to incorporate neurophysiological measures of brain activity into inferences concerning the acute impact of drugs on mental function, and demonstrate the feasibility of using multivariate combinations of behavioral and neurophysiological measures to sensitively characterize the pharmacodynamics of drug-induced changes in cognition.

Multimodal combination of neuroimaging methods for localizing the epileptogenic zone in MR-negative epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-022-19121-8	The objective was to determine the optimal combination of multimodal imaging methods (IMs) for localizing the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in patients with MR-negative drug-resistant epilepsy. Data from 25 patients with MR-negative focal epilepsy (age 30 ± 10 years, 16M/9F) who underwent surgical resection of the EZ and from 110 healthy controls (age 31 ± 9 years; 56M/54F) were used to evaluate IMs based on 3T MRI, FDG-PET, HD-EEG, and SPECT. Patients with successful outcomes and/or positive histological findings were evaluated. From 38 IMs calculated per patient, 13 methods were selected by evaluating the mutual similarity of the methods and the accuracy of the EZ localization. The best results in postsurgical patients for EZ localization were found for ictal/ interictal SPECT (SISCOM), FDG-PET, arterial spin labeling (ASL), functional regional homogeneity (ReHo), gray matter volume (GMV), cortical thickness, HD electrical source imaging (ESI-HD), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), diffusion tensor imaging, and kurtosis imaging. Combining IMs provides the method with the most accurate EZ identification in MR-negative epilepsy. The PET, SISCOM, and selected MRI-post-processing techniques are useful for EZ localization for surgical tailoring.

Effect of the GABAA agonist gaboxadol on nocturnal sleep and hormone secretion in healthy elderly subjects.	DOI: 10.1152/ajpendo.2001.281.1.E130	Aging is associated with a dramatic decrease in sleep intensity and continuity. The selective GABA(A) receptor agonist gaboxadol has been shown to increase non-REM sleep and the duration of the non-REM episodes in rats and sleep efficiency in young subjects and to enhance low-frequency activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-REM sleep in both rats and humans. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the influence of an oral dose of 15 mg of gaboxadol on nocturnal sleep and hormone secretion (ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone) in 10 healthy elderly subjects (6 women). Compared with placebo, gaboxadol did not affect endocrine activity but significantly reduced perceived sleep latency, elevated self-estimated total sleep time, and increased sleep efficiency by decreasing intermittent wakefulness and powerfully augmented low-frequency activity in the EEG within non-REM sleep. These findings indicate that gaboxadol is able to increase sleep consolidation and non-REM sleep intensity, without disrupting REM sleep, in elderly individuals and that these effects are not mediated by a modulation of hormone secretion.

Effect of repeated gaboxadol administration on night sleep and next-day performance in healthy elderly subjects.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1300641	Aging is associated with dramatic reductions in sleep continuity and sleep intensity. Since gaboxadol, a selective GABA(A) receptor agonist, has been demonstrated to improve sleep consolidation and promote deep sleep, it may be an effective hypnotic, particularly for elderly patients with insomnia. In the present study, we investigated the effects of subchronic gaboxadol administration on nocturnal sleep and its residual effects during the next days in elderly subjects. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced crossover study in 10 healthy elderly subjects without sleep complaints. The subjects were administered either placebo or 15 mg gaboxadol hydrochloride at bedtime on three consecutive nights. Sleep was recorded during each night from 2300 to 0700 h and tests assessing attention (target detection, stroop test) and memory function (visual form recognition, immediate word recall, digit span) were applied at 0900, 1400, and 1700 h during the following days. Compared with placebo, gaboxadol significantly shortened subjective sleep onset latency and increased self-rated sleep intensity and quality. Polysomnographic recordings showed that it significantly decreased the number of awakenings, the amount of intermittent wakefulness, and stage 1, and increased slow wave sleep and stage 2. These effects were stable over the three nights. None of the subjects reported side effects. Next-day cognitive performance was not affected by gaboxadol. Gaboxadol persistently improved subjective and objective sleep quality and was devoid of residual effects. Thus, at the employed dose, it seems an effective hypnotic in elderly subjects.

The GABA uptake inhibitor tiagabine promotes slow wave sleep in normal elderly subjects.	DOI: 10.1016/s0197-4580(00)00232-3	Aging is associated with a dramatic decrease in slow wave sleep (SWS) and sleep consolidation. Previous studies revealed that various GABA(A) agonists and the GABA uptake inhibitor tiagabine augment slow frequency components in the EEG within non-REM sleep, and thus promote deep sleep in young individuals and/or rats. In the present double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we assessed the effect of a single oral dose of 5 mg tiagabine on nocturnal sleep in ten healthy elderly volunteers (6 females). During the placebo night the subjects displayed a low sleep efficiency, due to high amounts of intermittent wakefulness, and little SWS. Tiagabine significantly increased sleep efficiency, tendentially decreased wakefulness and prominently increased both SWS and low-frequency activity in the EEG within non-REM sleep. The present findings demonstrate that tiagabine increases sleep quality in aged subjects. Moreover, the effects of tiagabine closely match those evoked by the GABA(A) agonist gaboxadol in young subjects and indicate that such compounds may have prospects in the treatment of sleep disturbances, particularly of those commonly occurring in the elderly.

Differences between magnetoencephalographic (MEG) spectral profiles of drugs acting on GABA at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites: a study in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2014.08.017	A range of medications target different aspects of the GABA system; understanding their effects is important to inform further drug development. Effects on the waking EEG comparing these mechanisms have not been reported; in this study we compare the effects on resting MEG spectra of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist zolpidem, the delta sub-unit selective agonist gaboxadol (also known as THIP) and the GABA reuptake inhibitor tiagabine. These were two randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies in healthy volunteers, one using zolpidem 10 mg, gaboxadol 15 mg and placebo, and the other tiagabine 15 mg and placebo. Whole head MEG recordings and individual MEG spectra were divided into frequency bands. Baseline spectra were subtracted from each post-intervention spectra and then differences between intervention and placebo compared. After zolpidem there were significant increases in beta frequencies and reduction in alpha frequency power; after gaboxadol and tiagabine there were significant increases in power at all frequencies up to beta. Enhancement of tonic inhibition via extrasynaptic receptors by gaboxadol gives rise to a very different MEG signature from the synaptic action of zolpidem. Tiagabine theoretically can affect both types of receptor; from these MEG results it is likely that the latter is the more prominent effect here.

The GABAA agonist THIP produces slow wave sleep and reduces spindling activity in NREM sleep in humans.	DOI: 10.1007/s002130050241	Recent studies in the rat demonstrated that systemic administration of muscimol and THIP, both selective GABAA receptor agonists, elevates slow wave activity in the EEG during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In this placebo-controlled study, we assessed the influence of an oral dose of 20 mg THIP on nocturnal sleep in young healthy humans. Compared to placebo, THIP increased slow wave sleep by about 25 min. Spectral analysis of the EEG within NREM sleep revealed significant elevations in the lower frequencies (< 8 Hz) and reductions in the spindle frequency range (approximately 10-16 Hz). In accordance with previous findings in the rat, these data imply that GABAA agonists promote deep NREM sleep, without suppressing REM sleep. These effects are opposite to those induced by agonistic modulators of GABAA receptors such as benzodiazepines and are at variance with established mechanisms according to which GABAA agonists and modulatory agonists would have similar effects. The sleep response to GABAA agonists is highly similar to that evoked by sustained wakefulness, suggesting that GABAA receptors may be implicated in the homeostatic regulation of sleep.

Associations of Plasma Glutamatergic Metabolites with Alpha Desynchronization during Cognitive Interference and Working Memory Tasks in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease.	DOI: 10.3390/cells13110970	Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have suggested compensatory brain overactivation in cognitively healthy (CH) older adults with pathological beta-amyloid(Aβ42)/tau ratios during working memory and interference processing. However, the association between glutamatergic metabolites and brain activation proxied by EEG signals has not been thoroughly investigated. We aim to determine the involvement of these metabolites in EEG signaling. We focused on CH older adults classified under (1) normal CSF Aβ42/tau ratios (CH-NATs) and (2) pathological Aβ42/tau ratios (CH-PATs). We measured plasma glutamine, glutamate, pyroglutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid concentrations using tandem mass spectrometry and conducted a correlational analysis with alpha frequency event-related desynchronization (ERD). Under the N-back working memory paradigm, CH-NATs presented negative correlations (r = ~-0.74--0.96, p = 0.0001-0.0414) between pyroglutamate and alpha ERD but positive correlations (r = ~0.82-0.95, p = 0.0003-0.0119) between glutamine and alpha ERD. Under Stroop interference testing, CH-NATs generated negative correlations between glutamine and left temporal alpha ERD (r = -0.96, p = 0.037 and r = -0.97, p = 0.027). Our study demonstrated that glutamine and pyroglutamate levels were associated with EEG activity only in CH-NATs. These results suggest cognitively healthy adults with amyloid/tau pathology experience subtle metabolic dysfunction that may influence EEG signaling during cognitive challenge. A longitudinal follow-up study with a larger sample size is needed to validate these pilot studies.

Nocturnal sodium oxybate increases the anterior cingulate cortex magnetic resonance glutamate signal upon awakening.	DOI: 10.1111/jsr.13866	Clinical guidelines recommend sodium oxybate (SXB; the sodium salt of γ-hydroxybutyrate) for the treatment of disturbed sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy, yet the underlying mode of action is elusive. In a randomised controlled trial in 20 healthy volunteers, we aimed at establishing neurochemical changes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) following SXB-enhanced sleep. The ACC is a core neural hub regulating vigilance in humans. At 2:30 a.m., we administered in a double-blind cross-over manner an oral dose of 50 mg/kg SXB or placebo, to enhance electroencephalography-defined sleep intensity in the second half of nocturnal sleep (11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.). Upon scheduled awakening, we assessed subjective sleepiness, tiredness and mood and measured two-dimensional, J-resolved, point-resolved magnetic resonance spectroscopy (PRESS) localisation at 3-Tesla field strength. Following brain scanning, we used validated tools to quantify psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) performance and executive functioning. We analysed the data with independent t tests, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple comparisons. The morning glutamate signal (at 8:30 a.m.) in the ACC was specifically increased after SXB-enhanced sleep in all participants in whom good-quality spectroscopy data were available (n = 16; pFDR  < 0.002). Further, global vigilance (10th-90th inter-percentile range on the PVT) was improved (pFDR  < 0.04) and median PVT response time was shorter (pFDR  < 0.04) compared to placebo. The data indicate that elevated glutamate in the ACC could provide a neurochemical mechanism underlying SXB's pro-vigilant efficacy in disorders of hypersomnolence.

Opposite Modulation of the NMDA Receptor by Glycine and S-Ketamine and the Effects on Resting State EEG Gamma Activity: New Insights into the Glutamate Hypothesis of Schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.3390/ijms24031913	NMDA-receptor hypofunction is increasingly considered to be an important pathomechanism in schizophrenia. However, to date, it has not been possible to identify patients with relevant NMDA-receptor hypofunction who would respond to glutamatergic treatments. Preclinical models, such as the ketamine model, could help identify biomarkers related to NMDA-receptor function that respond to glutamatergic modulation, for example, via activation of the glycine-binding site. We, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of opposing modulation of the NMDA receptor on gamma activity (30-100 Hz) at rest, the genesis of which appears to be highly dependent on NMDA receptors. The effects of subanesthetic doses of S-ketamine and pretreatment with glycine on gamma activity at rest were examined in twenty-five healthy male participants using 64-channel electroencephalography. Psychometric scores were assessed using the PANSS and the 5D-ASC. While S-ketamine significantly increased psychometric scores and gamma activity at the scalp and in the source space, pretreatment with glycine did not significantly attenuate any of these effects when controlled for multiple comparisons. Our results question whether increased gamma activity at rest constitutes a suitable biomarker for the target engagement of glutamatergic drugs in the preclinical ketamine model. They might further point to a differential role of NMDA receptors in gamma activity generation.

Fixel-based analysis links white matter characteristics, serostatus and clinical features in limbic encephalitis.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102289	Limbic encephalitis (LE) is an autoimmune syndrome often associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. Recent research suggests that particular structural changes in LE depend on the type of the associated antibody and occur in both mesiotemporal gray matter and white matter regions. However, it remains questionable to what degree conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-methods reflect alterations in white matter microstructure, since these methods do not account for crossing fibers. To address this methodological shortcoming, we applied fixel-based analysis as a novel technique modeling distinct fiber populations. For our study, 19 patients with LE associated with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD-LE, mean age = 35.9 years, 11 females), 4 patients with LE associated with autoantibodies against leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1-LE, mean age = 63.3 years, 2 females), 5 patients with LE associated with contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2, mean age = 57.4, 0 females), 20 age- and gender-matched control patients with hippocampal sclerosis (19 GAD-LE control patients: mean age = 35.1 years, 11 females; 4 LGI1-LE control patients: mean age = 52.6 years, 2 females; 5 CASPR2-LE control patients: mean age = 42.7 years, 0 females; 10 patients are included in more than one group) and 33 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects (19 GAD-LE healthy controls: mean age = 34.6 years, 11 females; 8 LGI1-LE healthy controls: mean age = 57.0 years, 4 females, 10 CASPR2-LE healthy controls: mean age = 57.2 years, 0 females; 4 subjects are included in more than one group) underwent structural imaging and DTI at 3 T and neuropsychological testing. Patient images were oriented according to lateralization in EEG resulting in an affected and unaffected hemisphere. Fixel-based metrics fiber density (FD), fiber cross-section (FC), and fiber density and cross-section (FDC = FD · FC) were calculated to retrieve information about white matter integrity both on the micro- and the macroscale. As compared to healthy controls, patients with GAD-LE showed significantly (family-wise error-corrected, p < 0.05) lower FDC in the superior longitudinal fascicle bilaterally and in the isthmus of the corpus callosum. In CASPR2-LE, lower FDC in the superior longitudinal fascicle was only present in the affected hemisphere. In LGI1-LE, we did not find any white matter alteration of the superior longitudinal fascicle. In an explorative tract-based correlation analysis within the GAD-LE group, only a correlation between the left/right ratio of FC values of the superior longitudinal fascicle and verbal memory performance (R = 0.64, Holm-Bonferroni corrected p < 0.048) remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Our results underscore the concept of LE as a disease comprising a broad and heterogeneous group of entities and contribute novel aspects to the pathomechanistic understanding of this disease that may strengthen the role of MRI in the diagnosis of LE.

Reduced auditory evoked gamma-band response and schizophrenia-like clinical symptoms under subanesthetic ketamine.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-019-0328-5	Abnormal gamma-band oscillations (GBO) have been frequently associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. GBO are modulated by glutamate, a neurotransmitter, which is continuously discussed to shape the complex symptom spectrum in schizophrenia. The current study examined the effects of ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, on the auditory-evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) and psychopathological outcomes in healthy volunteers to investigate neuronal mechanisms of psychotic behavior. In a placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design, the aeGBR power, phase-locking factor (PLF) during a choice reaction task, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale were assessed in 25 healthy subjects. Ketamine was applied in a subanaesthetic dose. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for EEG source localization. Significant reductions of the aeGBR power and PLF were identified under ketamine administration compared to placebo (p < 0.01). Source-space analysis of aeGBR generators revealed significantly reduced current source density (CSD) within the anterior cingulate cortex during ketamine administration. Ketamine induced an increase in all PANSS (p < 0.001) as well as 5D-ASC scores (p < 0.01) and increased response times (p < 0.001) and error rates (p < 0.01). Only negative symptoms were significantly associated with an aeGBR power decrease (p = 0.033) as revealed by multiple linear regression. These findings argue for a substantial role of the glutamate system in the mediation of dysfunctional gamma band responses and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia and are compatible with the NMDAR hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia.

A novel homozygous mutation in SZT2 gene in Saudi family with developmental delay, macrocephaly and epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1007/s13258-018-0673-5	Epileptic encephalopathies are genetically heterogeneous disorders which leads to epilepsy and cause neurological disorders. Seizure threshold 2 (SZT2) gene located on chromosome 1p34.2 encodes protein mainly expressed predominantly in the parietal and frontal cortex and dorsal root ganglia in the brain. Previous studies in mice showed that mutation in this gene can confers low seizure threshold, enhance epileptogenesis and in human may leads to facial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, seizure and macrocephaly. Objective of this study was to find out novel gene or novel mutation related to the gene phenotype. We have identified a large consanguineous Saudi family segregating developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, high forehead and macrocephaly. Exome sequencing was performed in affected siblings of the family to study the novel mutation. Whole exome sequencing data analysis, confirmed by subsequent Sanger sequencing validation study. Our results showed a novel homozygous mutation (c.9368G>A) in a substitution of a conserved glycine residue into a glutamic acid in the exon 67 of SZT2 gene. The mutation was ruled out in 100 unrelated healthy controls. The missense variant has not yet been reported as pathogenic in literature or variant databases. In conclusion, the here detected homozygous SZT2 variant might be the causative mutation that further explain epilepsy and developmental delay in this Saudi family.

Electrophysiological evidence for abnormal glutamate-GABA association following psychosis onset.	DOI: 10.1038/s41398-018-0261-0	Previous studies have shown glutamatergic dysfunction and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic dysfunction in schizophrenia. Animal studies suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction and GABA-ergic dysfunction interact with each other and lead to alterations in excitatory/inhibitory balance. The NMDAR and GABAergic-interneuron functions may be indexed by mismatch negativity (MMN) and auditory steady-state gamma-band response (ASSR), respectively. However, no previous studies have tested the hypothesis of an abnormal association between MMN and gamma-band ASSR in the same patients to identify the in vivo evidence of NMDAR-GABA association during the early stages of psychosis. Participants were individuals with recent-onset schizophrenia (ROSZ; N = 21), ultra-high risk (UHR; N = 27), and healthy controls (HCs; N = 24). The MMN amplitude was significantly impaired in ROSZ (p = 0.001, d = 1.20) and UHR (p = 0.003, d = 1.01) compared with HCs. The intertrial phase coherence (ITC) index of gamma-band ASSR was significantly reduced in ROSZ compared with HCs (p < 0.001, d = -1.27) and UHR (p = 0.032, d = -0.75). The event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) index of gamma-band ASSR was significantly smaller in ROSZ compared with HCs (p < 0.001, d = -1.21). The MMN amplitude was significantly correlated with the ITC in ROSZ (r = -0.69, p < 0.001). These findings provide the first in vivo evidence that an abnormal association of the electrophysiological indices of NMDAR and GABA dysfunctions may be present in recent-onset schizophrenia.

Association between Cortical GABA and Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potentials (LDAEP) in Humans.	DOI: 10.1093/ijnp/pyy056	Loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) is a widely used EEG-based biomarker for central serotonergic activity. Serotonin has been shown to be associated with different psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Despite its clinical significance, the underlying neurochemical mechanism of this promising marker is not fully understood, and further research is needed to improve its validity. Other neurotransmitters might have a significant impact on this measure. Thus, we assessed the inhibitory action through individual GABA/H20 concentrations and GABA/glutamate ratios by means of magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3T in healthy subjects. The measurements were assessed in the primary auditory cortex to investigate the association with the LDAEP, whose generators are mainly in the primary auditory cortex. For the first time, this study examines the link between GABAergic neurotransmission and LDAEP, and the data preliminary show that GABA may not contribute to the generation of EEG-based LDAEP.

Diurnal changes in glutamate + glutamine levels of healthy young adults assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.24225	The glutamatergic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor is involved in synaptic plasticity processes, and animal studies have demonstrated altered expression across the sleep wake cycle. Accordingly, glutamate levels are reduced during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and the rate of this decrease is positively correlated with sleep EEG slow wave activity (SWA). Here, we combined proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) and high-density sleep EEG to assess if 1 H-MRS is sensitive to diurnal changes of glutamate + glutamine (GLX) in healthy young adults and if potential overnight changes of GLX are correlated to SWA. 1 H-MRS was measured in the parietal lobe in the evening and in the subsequent morning. High-density sleep EEG was recorded overnight between the evening and morning scans. Our results revealed a significant overnight reduction in GLX, but no significant changes in other metabolites. The decrease in GLX positively correlated with the decrease of SWA. Our study demonstrates that quantification of diurnal changes in GLX is possible by means of 1 H-MRS and indicates that overnight changes in GLX are related to SWA, a marker that is closely linked to the restorative function of sleep. This relationship might be of particular interest in clinical populations in which sleep is disturbed.

Glutamatergic deficit and schizophrenia-like negative symptoms: new evidence from ketamine-induced mismatch negativity alterations in healthy male humans.	DOI: 10.1503/jpn.160187	Targeting the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a major translational approach for treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Ketamine comprehensively produces schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as positive, cognitive and negative symptoms in healthy volunteers. The amplitude of the mismatch negativity (MMN) is known to be significantly reduced not only in patients with schizophrenia, but also in healthy controls receiving ketamine. Accordingly, it was the aim of the present study to investigate whether changes of MMN amplitudes during ketamine administration are associated with the emergence of schizophrenia-like negative symptoms in healthy volunteers.

Reduced Mismatch Negativity is Associated with Increased Plasma Level of Glutamate in First-episode Psychosis.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-02267-1	Reduced amplitude of mismatch negativity (MMN) is one of the more promising biological markers of schizophrenia. This finding holds true in both early and chronic phases of the disorder, and is compatible with the glutamatergic dysfunction hypothesis. To further establish MMN as a biomarker of aberrant glutamatergic neurotransmission, an exploration for an association with blood levels of glutamatergic amino acids is an important next step. Despite a large body of work investigating MMN in schizophrenia, no previous studies have undertaken this endeavor. Nineteen patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP), 21 ultra-high risk individuals (UHR), and 16 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. The MMNs in response to duration change (dMMN) and frequency change (fMMN) were measured. The fasting plasma levels of glutamate, glutamine, glycine, D-serine, and L-serine were measured. dMMN amplitudes were significantly reduced in FEP and UHR, compared to HC. The plasma levels of glutamate of FEP were significantly higher than those of HC. Higher plasma levels of glutamate were associated with smaller dMMN amplitudes in the FEP and HC groups. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that MMN is a useful biological marker of aberrant glutamatergic neurotransmission in the early stages of schizophrenia.

GABA metabolism and its role in gamma-band oscillatory activity during auditory processing: An MRS and EEG study.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.23642	Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are believed to have inhibitory and exhibitory neuromodulatory effects that regulate the brain's response to sensory perception. Furthermore, frequency-specific synchronization of neuronal excitability within the gamma band (30-80 Hz) is attributable to a homeostatic balance between excitation and inhibition. However, our understanding of the physiological mechanism underlying gamma rhythms is based on animal models. Investigations of the relationship between GABA concentrations, glutamate concentrations, and gamma band activity in humans were mostly restricted to the visual cortex and are conflicting. Here, we performed a multimodal imaging study combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with electroencephalography (EEG) in the auditory cortex. In 14 healthy subjects, we investigated the impact of individual differences in GABA and glutamate concentration on gamma band response (GBR) following auditory stimulus presentation. We explored the effects of bulk GABA on the GBR across frequency (30-200 Hz) and time (-200 to 600 ms) and found no significant relationship. Furthermore, no correlations were found between gamma peak frequency or power measures and metabolite concentrations (GABA, glutamate, and GABA/glutamate ratio). These findings suggest that, according to MRS measurements, and given the auditory stimuli used in this study, GABA and glutamate concentrations are unlikely to play a significant role in the inhibitory and excitatory drive in the generation of gamma band activity in the auditory cortex.

Evidence for cognitive resource imbalance in adolescents with narcolepsy.	DOI: 10.1007/s11682-017-9706-y	The study investigated brain activity changes during performance of a verbal working memory task in a population of adolescents with narcolepsy. Seventeen narcolepsy patients and twenty healthy controls performed a verbal working memory task during simultaneous fMRI and EEG acquisition. All subjects also underwent MRS to measure GABA and Glutamate concentrations in the medial prefrontal cortex. Activation levels in the default mode network and left middle frontal gyrus were examined to investigate whether narcolepsy is characterized by an imbalance in cognitive resources. Significantly increased deactivation within the default mode network during task performance was observed for the narcolepsy patients for both the encoding and recognition phases of the task. No evidence for task performance deficits or reduced activation within the left middle frontal gyrus was noted for the narcolepsy patients. Correlation analyses between the spectroscopy and fMRI data indicated that deactivation of the anterior aspect of the default mode in narcolepsy patients correlated more with increased concentrations of Glutamate and decreased concentrations of GABA. In contrast, deactivation in the default mode was correlated with increased concentrations of GABA and decreased concentrations of Glutamate in controls. The results suggested that narcolepsy is not characterized by a deficit in working memory but rather an imbalance of cognitive resources in favor of monitoring and maintaining attention over actual task performance. This points towards dysregulation within the sustained attention system being the origin behind self-reported cognitive difficulties in narcolepsy.

Characterization of the influence of age on GABAA and glutamatergic mediated functions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using paired-pulse TMS-EEG.	DOI: 10.18632/aging.101178	Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions in the prefrontal cortex decreases with age. Further, cognitive function mediated through the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) also declines with age. Although neuroimaging studies have demonstrated decreased levels of these substances, direct neurophysiological data investigating the effect of aging in the DLPFC in human subjects is lacking. The advent of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) has allowed for the assessment of functional neurotransmission in vivo. In the present study, we examined short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) in a group of older adults (> 60 yrs) to evaluate the strength of GABAA and glutamate-mediated neurotransmission in the DLPFC, compared to younger adults (18-59 yrs). Older adults showed an increase of amplitude of N100 by the SICI paradigm, while N45 amplitude was increased and N100 amplitude was decreased by ICF. Moreover, these modulations significantly correlated with age. Our findings provide evidence for age-related alterations of excitatory and inhibitory functions in the prefrontal cortex in healthy adults. Future studies may aim to explore these neurophysiological relationships in the DLPFC in pathological forms of aging that affect cortical functioning such as mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

Microstructural and functional correlates of glutamate concentration in the posterior cingulate cortex.	DOI: 10.1002/jnr.24010	Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain and has a central role in both intrinsic and stimulus-induced activity. We conducted a study in a cohort of healthy, male volunteers in which glutamate levels were measured in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3T. The advantages of simultaneous electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-MRI) were exploited and the subjects were measured in the same session and under the same physiological conditions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI) and EEG were measured in order to investigate the functional and microstructural correlates of glutamate. The concentration of glutamate (institute units) was calculated and those values were tested for correlation with the metrics of resting state fMRI, DTI, and EEG electrical sources. Our results showed that the concentration of glutamate in the PCC had a significant negative correlation with the tissue mean diffusivity in the same area. The analysis of resting state networks did not show any relationship between the concentration of glutamate and the intrinsic activity of the resting state networks. The concentration of glutamate showed a positive correlation with the electrical generators of α-1 frequency and a negative correlation with the generators of α-2 and β-1 electrical generators. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Prefrontal White Matter Structure Mediates the Influence of GAD1 on Working Memory.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2016.14	The glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) gene is a major determinant of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter modulating local neuronal circuitry. GABAergic dysfunction and expression of GAD1 have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and in working memory impairment. We examined the influence of the functional GAD1 rs3749034 variant on white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), cortical thickness, and working memory performance in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (N=197). Using transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), we subsequently examined the effect of rs3749034 on long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (N=66). We found that the rs3749034 T-allele carrier risk group had lower voxel-wise FA in the prefrontal cortex region (PFWE-corrected<0.05) but not cortical thickness. Mixed-model regression revealed a significant effect on attentional processing and working memory across four performance measures (F1,182=11.5, P=8 × 10(-4)). FA in the prefrontal cortex was associated with digit-span performance. Voxel-wise mediation analysis revealed that the effect GAD1 on poorer digit-span performance statistically predicted the lower white matter FA (PFWE-corrected<0.05). In exploratory analysis, we found a prominent GAD1 genotype-by-diagnosis interaction on DLPFC LICI (F1,56=14.3, P=4.1 × 10(-4)). Our findings converge on variation in GAD1 gene predicting a susceptibility mechanism that affects white matter FA, GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission in the DLPFC, and working memory performance. Furthermore, via voxel mediation of FA and TMS-EEG intervention, we provide evidence for a potentially causal mechanism through which aberrant DLPFC GABA signaling may contribute to working memory dysfunction.

Multivariate genetic determinants of EEG oscillations in schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder from the BSNIP study.	DOI: 10.1038/tp.2015.76	Schizophrenia (SZ) and psychotic bipolar disorder (PBP) are disabling psychiatric illnesses with complex and unclear etiologies. Electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillatory abnormalities in SZ and PBP probands are heritable and expressed in their relatives, but the neurobiology and genetic factors mediating these abnormalities in the psychosis dimension of either disorder are less explored. We examined the polygenic architecture of eyes-open resting state EEG frequency activity (intrinsic frequency) from 64 channels in 105 SZ, 145 PBP probands and 56 healthy controls (HCs) from the multisite BSNIP (Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes) study. One million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were derived from DNA. We assessed eight data-driven EEG frequency activity derived from group-independent component analysis (ICA) in conjunction with a reduced subset of 10,422 SNPs through novel multivariate association using parallel ICA (para-ICA). Genes contributing to the association were examined collectively using pathway analysis tools. Para-ICA extracted five frequency and nine SNP components, of which theta and delta activities were significantly correlated with two different gene components, comprising genes participating extensively in brain development, neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Delta and theta abnormality was present in both SZ and PBP, while theta differed between the two disorders. Theta abnormalities were also mediated by gene clusters involved in glutamic acid pathways, cadherin and synaptic contact-based cell adhesion processes. Our data suggest plausible multifactorial genetic networks, including novel and several previously identified (DISC1) candidate risk genes, mediating low frequency delta and theta abnormalities in psychoses. The gene clusters were enriched for biological properties affecting neural circuitry and involved in brain function and/or development.

GABA/Glutamate synaptic pathways targeted by integrative genomic and electrophysiological explorations distinguish autism from intellectual disability.	DOI: 10.1038/mp.2015.75	Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity is predominant in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), for which the molecular and pathophysiological bases are still unclear. Significant comorbidity and genetic overlap between ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders are also well established. However, little is understood regarding the frequent observation of a wide phenotypic spectrum associated with deleterious mutations affecting a single gene even within multiplex families. We performed a clinical, neurophysiological (in vivo electroencephalography-auditory-evoked related potentials) and genetic (whole-exome sequencing) follow-up analysis of two families with known deleterious NLGN4X gene mutations (either truncating or overexpressing) present in individuals with ASD and/or with intellectual disability (ID). Complete phenotypic evaluation of the pedigrees in the ASD individuals showed common specific autistic behavioural features and neurophysiological patterns (abnormal MisMatch Negativity in response to auditory change) that were absent in healthy parents as well as in family members with isolated ID. Whole-exome sequencing in ASD patients from each family identified a second rare inherited genetic variant, affecting either the GLRB or the ANK3 genes encoding NLGN4X interacting proteins expressed in inhibitory or in excitatory synapses, respectively. The GRLB and ANK3 mutations were absent in relatives with ID as well as in control databases. In summary, our findings provide evidence of a double-hit genetic model focused on excitatory/inhibitory synapses in ASD, that is not found in isolated ID, associated with an atypical in vivo neurophysiological pattern linked to predictive coding.

Resting-state glutamatergic neurotransmission is related to the peak latency of the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) for duration deviants: An (1)H-MRS-EEG study.	DOI: 10.1111/psyp.12445	Mismatch negativity (MMN), an ERP elicited by a deviant stimulus in a train of standard stimuli, has been suggested to be associated to glutamatergic neurotransmission, mediated by glutamatergic NMDA receptors. In this study, we examined the relationship between interindividual variation of (1)H-MRS-measured glutamate+glutamine (Glx) in the superior temporal gyrus and MMN for duration and frequency deviants in 19 healthy young adults (9 male). We found a significant relationship between the peak latency of the duration-MMN peak and creatine-scaled Glx (p = .0003, η(2)  = .43), with increased Glx level being associated to earlier peak of the duration-MMN (r = -.63). In contrast, the amplitude of the duration-MMN was not related to Glx. There was no significant relationship between Glx and the frequency-MMN. The present study is the first to demonstrate that interindividual variation in the glutamatergic neurotransmission affects the MMN response in healthy individuals.

Frontal P3 event-related potential is related to brain glutamine/glutamate ratio measured in vivo.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.02.014	The auditory P3 event-related potential (ERP) is thought to index cognitive processing relevant to attention and working memory processes. Drug challenge studies suggest that glutamate neurotransmission plays an important role in modulating P3 ERP. However, while direct links between glutamate activity and P3 ERP response in humans are suspected, mechanistic details remain largely unknown. We investigated here the relationships between P3 ERP and indices of glutamatergic processing measured in vivo with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS). We hypothesized that a higher index of glutamatergic processing (glutamine/glutamate ratio; abbreviated Gln/Glu) in the anterior cingulate (ACC) and in the parietal-occipital (POC) cortices would associate with larger frontal P3a and parietal P3b amplitudes, respectively.

Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with the E200K mutation: longitudinal neuroimaging from asymptomatic to symptomatic CJD.	DOI: 10.1007/s00415-014-7615-1	"Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD) in Jews of Libyan ancestry is caused by an E200K mutation in the PRNP gene. While carriers are born with this mutation, they usually remain asymptomatic until middle age. Early detection of conversion is crucial for understanding and eventually for the treatment of the disease. The aim of this study was to report longitudinal MRI data in E200K individuals who eventually converted from healthy mutation carriers to clinically symptomatic CJD. As a part of a prospective study, asymptomatic E200K mutation carriers were scanned annually until their conversion to symptomatic disease. Standardized diffusion and anatomical MR sequences were performed before and after clinical conversion in the subjects and those were compared to 15 non-carrier siblings (""healthy controls""). Blinded radiological readings and region of interest analyses were performed. Radiological readings of individual cases failed to detect characteristic changes in the scans taken before the conversion. Region of interest analysis of diffusion changes in pre-symptomatic stage was inconclusive; however, ADC reduction was found in early and late stages of the disease. Computerized volumetric analysis revealed monotonic volume reductions in thalamus, putamen and caudate following conversion, and the lateral ventricles showed dilatation of up to 62 % after clinical conversion.

Narcolepsy patients have antibodies that stain distinct cell populations in rat brain and influence sleep patterns.	DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1412189111	Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder, likely with an autoimmune component. During 2009 and 2010, a link between A(H1N1)pdm09 Pandemrix vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was suggested in Scandinavia. In this study, we searched for autoantibodies related to narcolepsy using a neuroanatomical array: rat brain sections were processed for immunohistochemistry/double labeling using patient sera/cerebrospinal fluid as primary antibodies. Sera from 89 narcoleptic patients, 52 patients with other sleep-related disorders (OSRDs), and 137 healthy controls were examined. Three distinct patterns of immunoreactivity were of particular interest: pattern A, hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone and proopiomelanocortin but not hypocretin/orexin neurons; pattern B, GABAergic cortical interneurons; and pattern C, mainly globus pallidus neurons. Altogether, 24 of 89 (27%) narcoleptics exhibited pattern A or B or C. None of the patterns were exclusive for narcolepsy but were also detected in the OSRD group at significantly lower numbers. Also, some healthy controls exhibited these patterns. The antigen of pattern A autoantibodies was identified as the common C-terminal epitope of neuropeptide glutamic acid-isoleucine/α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (NEI/αMSH) peptides. Passive transfer experiments on rat showed significant effects of pattern A human IgGs on rapid eye movement and slow-wave sleep time parameters in the inactive phase and EEG θ-power in the active phase. We suggest that NEI/αMSH autoantibodies may interfere with the fine regulation of sleep, contributing to the complex pathogenesis of narcolepsy and OSRDs. Also, patterns B and C are potentially interesting, because recent data suggest a relevance of those brain regions/neuron populations in the regulation of sleep/arousal.

Sleep spindles are related to schizotypal personality traits and thalamic glutamine/glutamate in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1093/schbul/sbu109	Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder affecting approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Yet, schizophrenia-like experiences (schizotypy) are very common in the healthy population, indicating a continuum between normal mental functioning and the psychosis found in schizophrenic patients. A continuum between schizotypy and schizophrenia would be supported if they share the same neurobiological origin. Two such neurobiological markers of schizophrenia are: (1) a reduction of sleep spindles (12-15 Hz oscillations during nonrapid eye movement sleep), likely reflecting deficits in thalamo-cortical circuits and (2) increased glutamine and glutamate (Glx) levels in the thalamus. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether sleep spindles and Glx levels are related to schizotypal personality traits in healthy subjects.

Marked reductions in visual evoked responses but not γ-aminobutyric acid concentrations or γ-band measures in remitted depression.	DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.09.032	Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have consistently demonstrated reduced cortical γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in individuals with major depression. However, evidence for a persistent deficit during remission, which would suggest that GABA dysfunction is a possible trait marker of depression, is equivocal. Although MRS measures total concentration of GABA, magneto-encephalography provides direct measures of neural activity, with cortical γ oscillations shaped by the activity of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. In this study we investigated whether γ oscillations and GABA concentrations would differ in individuals with remitted depression (RD) compared with never depressed control subjects (ND).

Familial hemiplegic migraine.		Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a rare, dominantly inherited subtype of migraine with aura, where hemiplegia occurs during the aura phase. Mutation screening of families with FHM has revealed a range of different mutations. The mutated FHM genes code for ion transport proteins. Animal and cellular studies have associated the mutated FHM genes with disturbed ion homeostasis, altered cellular excitability and altered neurotransmitter release. Abnormal cortical excitability due to dysfunctional ion-channels might facilitate cortical spreading depression (CSD) and thereby migraine aura and migraine headache. Genotyped FHM patients offer us the chance to study the interplay between genotype and phenotype and may be regarded as a genetic migraine model. FHM studies might open for a better understanding of the molecular migraine pathology, and potentially help to unravel the pathogenesis of the more common migraine forms. We have therefore studied genotyped FHM patients to understand the effect of genotype on the response to migraine provoking substances. We show here that two known migraine triggers failed to induce more migraine aura or migraine headache in FHM-patients than in healthy controls, thus indicating that the FHM genotype does not confer hypersensitivity to these migraine triggers. This has implications for our understanding of the headache mechanisms and raises the question whether FHM share neurobiological background with the common types of migraine. The aims of the present thesis were to test the hypothesis that FHM mutations might be associated with hypersensitivity to known migraine triggers and, thereby, share pathophysiological pathways with the common types of migraine, but our results disprove this hypothesis. Thus, FHM seems very different from MO and MA, both genetically and pathophysiologically. The fact that FHM genes regulate ion homeostasis cannot be extrapolated to the common types of migraine.

Reliability and robustness of feedback-evoked brain-heart coupling after placebo, dopamine, and noradrenaline challenge.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2018.01.010	External and internal performance feedback triggers not only neural but also cardiac modulations, suggesting communication between brain and heart during feedback processing. Using Cardio-Electroencephalographic Covariance Tracing (CECT), it has accordingly been shown that feedback-evoked centromedial single-trial EEG at the P300 latency intraindividually predicts subsequent changes in heart period - the so called N300H phenomenon. While previous findings suggest that the N300H depends on serotonin, its relationship to central dopamine and noradrenaline is currently unknown. Here, we tested (1) the psychometric properties of this CECT-based component and (2) its putative catecholaminergic mechanisms. N = 54 healthy male participants received either a α2-adrenoceptor antagonist (yohimbine, 10 mg; n = 18), D2-dopamine-receptor antagonist (sulpiride, 200 mg; n = 18), or a placebo (n = 18). Afterwards, they performed a gambling task with feedback after each trial, while EEG and ECG were recorded. Feedback successfully evoked a significant N300H both across all 54 participants and within each substance group. Importantly, we show that N300H can be reliably measured in a priori defined time windows with as few as 240 feedback trials and is relatively unaffected when removing extreme single-trial values. However, we could not find any significant substance effects on N300H magnitude as well as on univariate feedback-related measures (FRN, P300, heart period). Altogether, the N300H component proves as a robust and reliable marker of cortico-cardiac coupling evoked by feedback. Furthermore, these findings suggest a subordinate role of catecholamines (i.e., noradrenaline and dopamine) and sympathetic pathways in feedback-evoked brain-heart communication as measured with N300H.

Noradrenergic stimulation enhances human action monitoring.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4437-04.2005	Noradrenergic neurotransmission has been associated with the modulation of higher cognitive functions mediated by the prefrontal cortex. In the present study, the impact of noradrenergic stimulation on the human action-monitoring system, as indexed by event-related brain potentials, was examined. After the administration of a placebo or the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, which stimulates firing in the locus ceruleus and noradrenaline release, electroencephalograpic recordings were obtained from healthy volunteers performing a letter flanker task. Yohimbine led to an increase in the amplitude of the error-related negativity in conjunction with a significant reduction of action errors. Reaction times were unchanged, and the drug did not modify the N2 in congruent versus incongruent trials, a measure of preresponse conflict, or posterror adjustments as measured by posterror slowing of reaction time. The present findings suggest that the locus ceruleus-noradrenaline system exerts a rather specific effect on human action monitoring.

Alpha2-noradrenergic effects on ERP and behavioral indices of auditory information processing.	DOI: 10.1017/S0048577202991298	Norepinephrine is believed to modulate CNS processing of environmental signals. However, its specific role in stimulus evaluation processes has not been delineated. We examined the effects of the alpha2 noradrenergic agents, clonidine and yohimbine, on ERP and performance measures of auditory information processing. Ten healthy participants performed a three-tone target detection experiment, receiving either placebo, 0.2 mg clonidine, or 30 mg yohimbine, in a double-blind randomized design. The principal locus of action of the noradrenergic agents occurred between 100 and 200 ms poststimulus. P200 latency was sped by yohimbine and slowed by clonidine, and the frontal P3a was shifted in tandem. Components related to target detection (N250 and P3b) were unaffected. The results suggest that norepinephrine modulates CNS mechanisms of selective attention to infrequent stimuli. This may be relevant for patients with schizophrenia, a subset of whom exhibit selective abnormalities of these same ERP components. Our results offer a possible link between these two sets of findings, suggesting that some patients with schizophrenia may have dysfunctional noradrenergic systems.

Differential effects of noradrenergic drugs on anxiety and arousal in healthy volunteers with high and low anxiety.	DOI: 10.1016/s0278-5846(96)00131-5	1. The appearance of frontal midline theta activity (Fm theta), the distinct EEG theta rhythm in the frontal midline area during performance of a mental task, indicates relief from anxiety in humans. 2. The authors investigated the effects of clonidine and yohimbine on anxiety and arousal in 24 male university students with (Fm theta group, n = 12) and without (non-Fm theta group, n = 12) Fm theta. Subjects received placebo, 0.15 mg clonidine and 15 mg yohimbine in a double-blind crossover design. 3. Blood samples were obtained, state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) scores were determined, and EEGs were recorded before and during the performance of an arithmetic addition task. The test was repeated twice: before and 1 hr after drug administration. 4. Clonidine reduced the 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) concentration in both groups; yohimbine caused an increase in both groups. In the Fm theta group, clonidine reduced the appearance time of Fm theta and the number of task performance but did not alter the state anxiety scores; yohimbine had no effects on Fm theta or the state anxiety but increased the task performance. In the non-Fm theta group, clonidine increased the Fm theta amount and reduced the state anxiety score but did not affect task performance, while yohimbine reduced Fm theta but increased the state anxiety, the task performance and the number of errors. 5. These results suggest that changes in noradrenaline (NA) activity affect both anxiety and arousal levels in high-anxiety humans, but predominantly affect only the arousal level in low-anxiety humans.

Influence of quinidine on the pharmacokinetics of trimipramine and on its effect on the waking EEG of healthy volunteers. A pilot study on two subjects.	DOI: 10.1159/000118840	The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (waking EEG) of 75 mg trimipramine taken orally were determined in two healthy volunteers on two separate occasions, once without and once after comedication with 2 x 50 mg quinidine. Quinidine, a potent cytochrome P-450IID6 inhibitor, is used as a pharmacological tool to mimic a lack of this enzyme in man. In this study, it markedly altered the pharmacokinetics of trimipramine, almost doubling its plasma half-life and decreasing its apparent clearance and volume of distribution. These results strongly suggest that trimipramine is a substrate of cytochrome P-450IID6. These modifications of trimipramine metabolism were accompanied by measurable changes in some EEG variables, most notably with regard to the relative power in the alpha and theta bands, which showed higher and longer-lasting effects of trimipramine. Since cytochrome P-450IID6 is deficient in 5-10% of Caucasian subjects, this may have consequences in trimipramine-treated subjects, especially with regard to the effects of the drug on the EEG.

Fluorescence-based method for assessment of blood-brain barrier disruption.	DOI: 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610181	We report on a fluorescence-based optical method for assessment of blood-brain barrier in humans. The technique is based on monitoring of fluorescence light excited in the dye circulating in the brain. Measurements were carried out in healthy volunteers and in patients with disruption of the blood-brain barrier with the use of time-resolved method during inflow and washout of indocyanine green after its intravenous injection. We show large differences in the fluorescence signals - in healthy subjects a fast washout of the dye can be observed whereas in patients the washout is significantly prolonged. We conclude that the monitoring of the fluorescence signals during injection of exogenous optical contrast agent can be used for the assessment of the condition of blood-brain barrier at the bedside.

The effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on gamma oscillatory activity in schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0022627	Gamma (γ) oscillations (30-50 Hz) have been shown to be excessive in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) during working memory (WM). WM is a cognitive process that involves the online maintenance and manipulation of information that is mediated largely by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) represents a non-invasive method to stimulate the cortex that has been shown to enhance cognition and γ oscillatory activity during WM.

Inter-ictal and post-ictal circulating levels of allopregnanolone, an anticonvulsant metabolite of progesterone, in epileptic children.	DOI: 10.1016/s0920-1211(03)00042-1	Allopregnanolone belongs to a group of neuroactive steroid hormones, or neurosteroids, synthesized and acting within the brain and is as a potent endogenous positive modulator of GABA(A) receptor complex. Administration of allopregnanolone protects rats against pentylentetrazol, bicuculline, kainic acid, and picrotoxin-induced seizures. We investigated serum allopregnanolone levels in children with active epilepsy at pubertal Tanner's stage I (n=52). Blood specimens were collected at least 12 h after a seizure (inter-ictal). In a subgroup of patients (n=11), specimens were also collected within 30 min from a seizure attack (post-ictal). Healthy age-matched children (n=18) served as controls. Serum allopregnanolone was measured by radioimmunoassay using a polyclonal antiserum. The inter-ictal serum allopregnanolone levels in the epileptic children were not statistically different from those detected in the control group, whereas post-ictal levels were significantly higher than the inter-ictal ones (P=0.0001). In this subgroup of patients allopregnanolone levels decreased to the basal values during the following 12 h. Serum allopregnanolone levels may therefore reflect changes in neuronal excitability, and allopregnanolone appears to be a reliable circulating marker of epileptic seizures. It is possible that increased post-ictal serum levels of allopregnanolone may play a role in modulating neuronal excitability and may represent an endogenous mechanism of seizure control.

Differential Cerebral Gustatory Responses to Sucrose, Aspartame, and Stevia Using Gustatory Evoked Potentials in Humans.	DOI: 10.3390/nu12020322	Aspartame and Stevia are widely substituted for sugar. Little is known about cerebral activation in response to low-caloric sweeteners in comparison with high-caloric sugar, whereas these molecules lead to different metabolic effects. We aimed to compare gustatory evoked potentials (GEPs) obtained in response to sucrose solution in young, healthy subjects, with GEPs obtained in response to aspartame and Stevia. Twenty healthy volunteers were randomly stimulated with three solutions of similar intensities of sweetness: Sucrose 10 g/100 mL of water, aspartame 0.05 g/100 mL, and Stevia 0.03 g/100 mL. GEPs were recorded with EEG (Electroencephalogram) electrodes. Hedonic values of each solution were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS). The main result was that P1 latencies of GEPs were significantly shorter when subjects were stimulated by the sucrose solution than when they were stimulated by either the aspartame or the Stevia one. P1 latencies were also significantly shorter when subjects were stimulated by the aspartame solution than the Stevia one. No significant correlation was noted between GEP parameters and hedonic values marked by VAS. Although sucrose, aspartame, and Stevia lead to the same taste perception, cerebral activation by these three sweet solutions are different according to GEPs recording. Besides differences of taste receptors and cerebral areas activated by these substances, neural plasticity, and change in synaptic connections related to sweet innate preference and sweet conditioning, could be the best hypothesis to explain the differences in cerebral gustatory processing after sucrose and sweeteners activation.

Cortical neurons and networks are dormant but fully responsive during isoelectric brain state.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awx175	A continuous isoelectric electroencephalogram reflects an interruption of endogenously-generated activity in cortical networks and systematically results in a complete dissolution of conscious processes. This electro-cerebral inactivity occurs during various brain disorders, including hypothermia, drug intoxication, long-lasting anoxia and brain trauma. It can also be induced in a therapeutic context, following the administration of high doses of barbiturate-derived compounds, to interrupt a hyper-refractory status epilepticus. Although altered sensory responses can be occasionally observed on an isoelectric electroencephalogram, the electrical membrane properties and synaptic responses of individual neurons during this cerebral state remain largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to characterize the intracellular correlates of a barbiturate-induced isoelectric electroencephalogram and to analyse the sensory-evoked synaptic responses that can emerge from a brain deprived of spontaneous electrical activity. We first examined the sensory responsiveness from patients suffering from intractable status epilepticus and treated by administration of thiopental. Multimodal sensory responses could be evoked on the flat electroencephalogram, including visually-evoked potentials that were significantly amplified and delayed, with a high trial-to-trial reproducibility compared to awake healthy subjects. Using an analogous pharmacological procedure to induce prolonged electro-cerebral inactivity in the rat, we could describe its cortical and subcortical intracellular counterparts. Neocortical, hippocampal and thalamo-cortical neurons were all silent during the isoelectric state and displayed a flat membrane potential significantly hyperpolarized compared with spontaneously active control states. Nonetheless, all recorded neurons could fire action potentials in response to intracellularly injected depolarizing current pulses and their specific intrinsic electrophysiological features were preserved. Manipulations of the membrane potential and intracellular injection of chloride in neocortical neurons failed to reveal an augmented synaptic inhibition during the isoelectric condition. Consistent with the sensory responses recorded from comatose patients, large and highly reproducible somatosensory-evoked potentials could be generated on the inactive electrocorticogram in rats. Intracellular recordings revealed that the underlying neocortical pyramidal cells responded to sensory stimuli by complex synaptic potentials able to trigger action potentials. As in patients, sensory responses in the isoelectric state were delayed compared to control responses and exhibited an elevated reliability during repeated stimuli. Our findings demonstrate that during prolonged isoelectric brain state neurons and synaptic networks are dormant rather than excessively inhibited, conserving their intrinsic properties and their ability to integrate and propagate environmental stimuli.

Modulation of the cortical processing of novel and target stimuli by drugs affecting glutamate and GABA neurotransmission.	DOI: 10.1017/S1461145708009334	In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we examined the effects of subanaesthetic doses of ketamine (an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist) and thiopental (a GABA-A receptor agonist) on the event-related potential (ERP) correlates of deviant stimulus processing in 24 healthy adults. Participants completed three separate pharmacological challenge sessions (ketamine, thiopental, saline) in a counterbalanced order. EEG data were recorded both before and during each challenge while participants performed a visual 'oddball' task consisting of infrequent 'target' and 'novel' stimuli intermixed with frequent 'standard' stimuli. We examined drug effects on the amplitude and latency of the P300 (P3) component of the ERP elicited by target (P3b) and novel stimuli (P3a), as well as the N200 (N2) component elicited by both target and novel stimuli, and the N100 (N1) elicited by standard stimuli. Relative to placebo, both drugs reduced the amplitude of parietal P3b. While both drugs reduced parietal P3a and Novelty N2, ketamine also shortened P3a latency, reduced Novelty N2 amplitude more than thiopental, and increased frontal P3a amplitude relative to placebo. Overall, the data suggest that both the GABA-A and NMDA receptor systems modulate P3b and P3a. NMDA antagonism appears to lead to more varied effects on the neural correlates of novelty processing.

Propofol-induced alpha rhythm.	DOI: 10.1159/000079981	The electroencephalographic effects of two intravenous sedative/hypnotic drugs, propofol and thiopental, were studied at three stable blood concentrations in 52 normal healthy volunteers. The higher concentration resulted in unresponsiveness (lack of response to auditory/tactile stimuli) in all subjects. This report describes the strong frontal-central rhythms apparent in this state using a quantitative description of oscillatory systems underlying the rhythm. These rhythms occur when sedative drug concentrations are greater than those producing the well-described increase in broadband beta-power associated with many sedative drugs. Propofol induces rhythms in the alpha-range, while thiopental produces rhythms in the beta-range. Quasistationary for a period of about 1 h, these rhythms exceed the baseline alpha-rhythm in power. By their resonant nature, these propofol-induced rhythms are analogous to 'the classic alpha-rhythm', but quantitative characteristics of the underlying oscillatory systems are different. Baseline properties of the oscillatory system underlying the initial resting alpha-rhythm recover completely as drug concentration decays to negligible values.

Resting-state EEG dynamic functional connectivity distinguishes non-psychotic major depression, psychotic major depression and schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1038/s41380-023-02395-3	This study aims to identify dynamic patterns within the spatiotemporal feature space that are specific to nonpsychotic major depression (NPMD), psychotic major depression (PMD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). The study also evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms based on these network manifestations in differentiating individuals with NPMD, PMD, and SCZ. A total of 579 participants were recruited, including 152 patients with NPMD, 45 patients with PMD, 185 patients with SCZ, and 197 healthy controls (HCs). A dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) approach was employed to estimate the principal FC states within each diagnostic group. Incremental proportions of data (ranging from 10% to 100%) within each diagnostic group were used for variability testing. DFC metrics, such as proportion, mean duration, and transition number, were examined among the four diagnostic groups to identify disease-related neural activity patterns. These patterns were then used to train a two-layer classifier for the four groups (HC, NPMD, PMD, and SCZ). The four principal brain states (i.e., states 1,2,3, and 4) identified by the DFC approach were highly representative within and across diagnostic groups. Between-group comparisons revealed significant differences in network metrics of state 2 and state 3, within delta, theta, and gamma frequency bands, between healthy individuals and patients in each diagnostic group (p < 0.01, FDR corrected). Moreover, the identified key dynamic network metrics achieved an accuracy of 73.1 ± 2.8% in the four-way classification of HC, NPMD, PMD, and SCZ, outperforming the static functional connectivity (SFC) approach (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that the proposed DFC approach can identify dynamic network biomarkers at the single-subject level. These biomarkers have the potential to accurately differentiate individual subjects among various diagnostic groups of psychiatric disorders or healthy controls. This work may contribute to the development of a valuable EEG-based diagnostic tool with enhanced accuracy and assistive capabilities.

High-gamma activity in an attention network predicts individual differences in elderly adults' behavioral performance.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.037	The current study used a magnetoencephalogram to investigate the relationship between high-gamma (52-100 Hz) activity within an attention network and individual differences in behavioral performance among healthy elderly adults. We analyzed brain activity in 41 elderly subjects performing a 3-stimulus visual oddball task. In addition to the average amplitude of event-related fields in the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS), high-gamma power in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the strength of high-gamma imaginary coherence between the right MFG and the left MFG, and those between the right MFG and the left thalamus predicted individual differences in reaction time. In addition, high-gamma power in the left MFG was correlated with task accuracy, whereas high-gamma power in the left thalamus and left IPS was correlated with individual processing speed. The direction of correlations indicated that higher high-gamma power or coherence in an attention network was associated with better task performance and, presumably, higher cognitive function. Thus, high-gamma activity in different regions of this attention network differentially contributed to attentional processing, and such activity could be a fundamental process associated with individual differences in cognitive aging.

Pharmacodynamic effects of suvorexant and zolpidem on EEG during sleep in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2016.07.002	The objective of this study was to evaluate sleep electrophysiology in healthy subjects after bedtime administration of therapeutic doses of two insomnia treatments - the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant or the GABAergic agonist zolpidem. Eighteen healthy men received single bedtime doses of suvorexant 20mg, zolpidem 10mg, or placebo in a double-blinded, randomized, balanced 3-period crossover study. EEG power spectral densities during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were recorded in a polysomnography (PSG) laboratory using a 19-lead EEG recording array. Spectral density was analyzed for each lead for frequencies between 1-32Hz. During NREM and REM sleep, zolpidem treatment reduced spectral density across theta and alpha frequency bands in all leads. In contrast, suvorexant had no significant effects on spectral density in any frequency band during NREM sleep, and modestly increased spectral density in the theta frequency band during REM sleep. Although the study was not designed to detect effects on PSG sleep endpoints in healthy subjects, both suvorexant and zolpidem increased mean total sleep time and sleep efficiency. Zolpidem reduced latency to persistent sleep whereas suvorexant did not. Suvorexant decreased wake after sleep onset, whereas zolpidem did not. These findings suggest that EEG power spectral density profile after administration of suvorexant in healthy subjects more closely approximates placebo sleep physiology than after zolpidem treatment.

A comparison of central and peripheral effects of cetirizine and loratadine.	DOI: 10.1177/030006059101900401	In a double-blind, crossover, randomized clinical pharmacological study performed on 10 healthy volunteers, peripheral and central effects of 10 mg cetirizine and 10 and 40 mg loratadine were compared. Cetirizine (10 mg) significantly (P less than 0.001) inhibited 10 or 100 mg/ml histamine-induced weals 2 and 6 h after drug intake. Cetirizine was more potent than 10 mg loratadine after 2 and 6 h, and was even more potent than 40 mg loratadine after 6 h. Neither drug affected subjective evaluation of central effects and cetirizine was completely devoid of electro-encephalographic (EEG) changes, whereas 10 and 40 mg loratadine induced only slight and limited EEG changes.

Slow wave sleep and 5-HT2 receptor sensitivity during maintenance tricyclic antidepressant treatment.	DOI: 10.1016/0165-0327(90)90105-h	The 5-HT2 receptor antagonist cyproheptadine significantly increased slow wave sleep in 12 healthy control subjects but not in 12 patients with a history of major depression, maintained on tricyclic antidepressant treatment. Cyproheptadine produced a similar reduction in REM sleep in both groups of subjects. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that tricyclic antidepressant treatment alters brain 5-HT2 receptor sensitivity, but a primary abnormality in slow wave sleep regulation in depressed patients cannot be excluded.

Insomnia in somatoform pain disorder: sleep laboratory studies on differences to controls and acute effects of trazodone, evaluated by the Somnolyzer 24 x 7 and the Siesta database.	DOI: 10.1159/000085207	Patients with chronic pain often suffer from sleep disturbances, specifically decreased deep sleep, and thus may get into a vicious circle which maintains their pain condition. Utilizing polysomnography and psychometry, objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality was investigated in 11 patients with nonorganic insomnia (F51.0) related to somatoform pain disorder (SPD; F45.4) as compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls of the Siesta normative database. Patients demonstrated a markedly deteriorated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a decreased Quality of Life Index, slightly increased self-reported anxiety (Zung SAS) and depression scores (Zung SDS), as well as an increased Epworth Sleepiness Scale and International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale score. Subjective sleep and awakening quality was markedly reduced, while somatic complaints were increased. Polysomnographic evaluation by a recently developed automatic sleep classifier (Somnolyzer 24 x 7) based on the rules of Rechtschaffen and Kales demonstrated reduced slow-wave sleep (SWS), the target variable in the present study, a decreased stage shift index, increased SWS latency and stage 4 sleep (S4) latency and an increased frequency of shifts from S2 to wakefulness (W) in patients as compared with controls. Minimal oxygen saturation was found decreased, periodic leg movements (PLMs) were increased. In the morning, patients showed deteriorated well-being, drive, mood and wakefulness. There were no significant noopsychic or psychophysiological differences between patients and controls (except for a reduced numerical memory and a slightly increased morning diastolic blood pressure in patients). Subsequent evaluation of the acute effects of 100 mg of a controlled-release formulation of trazodone (Trittico retard) in the patients demonstrated an increase in the target variable SWS, accompanied by a reduction in the number of awakenings and stage shifts. It normalized the frequency of shifts from S2 to W and reduced the frequency of shifts from W to S1, from S1 to S2, as well as from any stage to S1 and S2. Trazodone, however, also significantly reduced the total sleep period and S2 and increased the latency to S1. Moreover, the drug increased the reduced minimal O(2 )saturation, reduced the arousal index and the PLMs-in-wake index and normalized the increased morning diastolic blood pressure. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that SPD induced significant changes in subjective and objective sleep and awakening quality, which were partially mitigated by trazodone therapy. The data on the target variable SWS support our hypothesis of a key-lock principle in the diagnosis and drug treatment of sleep disorders. Our study provided the first evidence on the usefulness of the Somnolyzer 24 x 7 and the Siesta database in clinical practice.

Effects of trazodone and imipramine on the biological rhythm: an analysis of sleep EEG and body core temperature.	DOI: 10.1272/jnms.69.333	Depression commonly involves abnormalities of the sleep-wake rhythm, the temperature rhythm, and other biological rhythms. The changes of these biological rhythms are caused in remission by medications. However, it has yet to be clarified whether the biological rhythms are changed as a result of recovery from depression or from the direct pharmacological effects of the antidepressants. Therefore, we have undertaken a study on the direct effects of the antidepressants trazodone and imipramine on the biological rhythms of healthy volunteers. The study involved 12 healthy male volunteers (ages 21 approximately 28 years, mean age 23.9+/-1.7 years) who had given written informed consent. Placebo, trazodone, and imipramine were each administered in a single blind manner four times a day, during the three-day study period. The total daily dosage of trazodone was 100 mg (50 mg in one subject), and of imipramine 40 mg (20 mg in one subject). Subjects were submitted to polysomnography (PSG) and body core temperature (rectal temperature) measurements during the study period. We compared the data concerning the antidepressants to those of the placebo. The results show that, with regard to the sleep rhythm, trazodone significantly increased slow wave sleep (SWS), but no changes were observed in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Imipramine significantly decreased REM sleep and prolonged the REM cycle. With regard to the temperature rhythm, trazodone showed a tendency to advance the appearance time of the minimal temperature. Imipramine significantly lowered the maximal temperature and decreased the difference between the maximal and the minimal temperature, but no changes in the phases were observed. Neither antidepressant had any effect on the temperature cycle. Trazodone and imipramine showed different effects on PSG. Furthermore, they had different effects on the temperature rhythm. The changes of the sleep-wake rhythm were greater than those of the temperature rhythm. Although the two antidepressants had different mechanisms of action, it is worthy of note that both directly influenced the biological rhythms of healthy volunteers.

Effects on sleep stages and microarchitecture of caffeine and its combination with zolpidem or trazodone in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881109104852	Caffeine is the world's most popular stimulant and is known to disrupt sleep. Administration of caffeine can therefore be used in healthy volunteers to mimic the effects of insomnia and thus to test the hypnotic effects of medication. This study assessed the effects of caffeine on sleep architecture and electroencephalography (EEG) spectrum alone and in combination with two different sleep-promoting medications. Home polysomnography was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers in a double-blind study whereby subjects received placebo, caffeine (150 mg), caffeine plus zolpidem (10 mg) and caffeine plus trazodone (100 mg) at bedtime in a randomised crossover design. In addition to delaying sleep onset, caffeine decreased total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE) and stage 2 sleep without significantly altering wake after sleep onset or the number of awakenings. Zolpidem attenuated the caffeine-induced decrease in SE and increased spindle density in the caffeine plus zolpidem combination compared with placebo. Trazodone attenuated the decrease in SE and TST, and it also increased stage 3 sleep, decreased the number of awakenings and decreased the spindle density. No significant changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were observed, neither was any significant alteration in slow wave activity nor other EEG spectral measures, although the direction of change was similar to that previously reported for caffeine and appeared to 'normalise' after trazodone. These data suggest that caffeine mimics some, but not all of the sleep disruption seen in insomnia and that its disruptive effects are differentially attenuated by the actions of sleep-promoting compounds with distinct mechanisms of action.

The impact of perfectionism and anxiety traits on action monitoring in major depressive disorder.	DOI: 10.1007/s00702-010-0419-2	Perfectionism and anxiety features are involved in the clinical presentation and neurobiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). In MDD, cognitive control mechanisms such as action monitoring can adequately be investigated applying electrophysiological registrations of the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe). It is also known that traits of perfectionism and anxiety influence ERN amplitudes in healthy subjects. The current study explores the impact of perfectionism and anxiety traits on action monitoring in MDD. A total of 39 MDD patients performed a flankers task during an event-related potential (ERP) session and completed the multidimensional perfectionism scale (MPS) with its concern over mistakes (CM) and doubt about actions (DA) subscales and the trait form of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Multiple regression analyses with stepwise backward elimination revealed MPS-DA to be a significant predictor (R (2):0.22) for the ERN outcomes, and overall MPS (R (2):0.13) and MPS-CM scores (R (2):0.18) to have significant predictive value for the Pe amplitudes. Anxiety traits did not have a predictive capacity for the ERPs. MPS-DA clearly affected the ERN, and overall MPS and MPS-CM influenced the Pe, whereas no predictive capacity was found for anxiety traits. The manifest impact of perfectionism on patients' error-related ERPs may contribute to our understanding of the action-monitoring process and the functional significance of the Pe in MDD. The divergent findings for perfectionism and anxiety features also indicate that the wide range of various affective personality styles might exert a different effect on action monitoring in MDD, awaiting further investigation.

A preliminary study of the effects of nighttime administration of the serotonin agonist, m-CPP, on sleep architecture and behavior in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/0006-3223(91)91290-8	The effects of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) (0.5 mg/kg) on sleep architecture and behavior were examined in six healthy volunteers following a single oral dose of the drug in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. m-CPP reduced total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency in all subjects. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep were decreased and stage 1 sleep was prolonged in a majority of subjects. Prominent behavioral and psychological effects were reported in five out of six subjects following m-CPP (but not following placebo) that interfered with sleep. The sleep disruption and behavioral activation following nighttime administration of m-CPP contrasts with the sedative properties of its parent compound, trazodone, suggesting that the hypnotic effect of trazodone is not related to the agonist profile of its metabolite, m-CPP.

Retinoic Acid Induces Hyperactivity, and Blocking Its Receptor Unmasks Light Responses and Augments Vision in Retinal Degeneration.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2019.02.015	Light responses are initiated in photoreceptors, processed by interneurons, and synaptically transmitted to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which send information to the brain. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a blinding disease caused by photoreceptor degeneration, depriving downstream neurons of light-sensitive input. Photoreceptor degeneration also triggers hyperactive firing of RGCs, obscuring light responses initiated by surviving photoreceptors. Here we show that retinoic acid (RA), signaling through its receptor (RAR), is the trigger for hyperactivity. A genetically encoded reporter shows elevated RAR signaling in degenerated retinas from murine RP models. Enhancing RAR signaling in healthy retinas mimics the pathophysiology of degenerating retinas. Drug inhibition of RAR reduces hyperactivity in degenerating retinas and unmasks light responses in RGCs. Gene therapy inhibition of RAR increases innate and learned light-elicited behaviors in vision-impaired mice. Identification of RAR as the trigger for hyperactivity presents a degeneration-dependent therapeutic target for enhancing low vision in RP and other blinding disorders.

Intravenous Ganaxolone: Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, Safety, and Tolerability in Healthy Adults.	DOI: 10.1002/cpdd.1365	Ganaxolone, a neuroactive steroid anticonvulsant that modulates both synaptic and extrasynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA ) receptors, is in development for treatment of status epilepticus (SE) and rare epileptic disorders, and has been approved in the United States for treatment of seizures associated with cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 deficiency disorder in patients ≥2 years old. This phase 1 study in 36 healthy volunteers evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of intravenous ganaxolone administered as a (i) single bolus, (ii) infusion, and (iii) bolus followed by continuous infusion. After a single bolus over 2 minutes (20 mg) or 5 minutes (10 or 30 mg), ganaxolone was detected in plasma with a median Tmax of 5 minutes, whereas a 60-minute infusion (10 or 30 mg) or a bolus (6 mg over 5 minutes) followed by infusion (20 mg/h) for 4 hours achieved a median Tmax of approximately 1 and 3 hours, respectively. Cmax was dose and administration-time dependent, ranging from 73.8 ng/mL (10 mg over 5 minutes) to 1240 ng/mL (30 mg over 5 minutes). Bolus doses above 10 mg of ganaxolone markedly influenced the bispectral index score with a rapid decline; smaller changes occurred on the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale and in quantitative electroencephalogram. Most adverse events were of mild severity, with 2 events of moderate severity; none were reported as serious. No effects on systemic hemodynamics or respiratory functions were reported.

Neuronal excitatory-to-inhibitory balance is altered in cerebral organoid models of genetic neurological diseases.	DOI: 10.1186/s13041-021-00864-w	The neuro-physiological properties of individuals with genetic pre-disposition to neurological disorders are largely unknown. Here we aimed to explore these properties using cerebral organoids (COs) derived from fibroblasts of individuals with confirmed genetic mutations including PRNPE200K, trisomy 21 (T21), and LRRK2G2019S, which are associated with Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, Down Syndrome, and Parkinson's disease. We utilized no known disease/healthy COs (HC) as normal function controls. At 3-4 and 6-10 months post-differentiation, COs with mutations showed no evidence of disease-related pathology. Electrophysiology assessment showed that all COs exhibited mature neuronal firing at 6-10 months old. At this age, we observed significant changes in the electrophysiology of the COs with disease-associated mutations (dCOs) as compared with the HC, including reduced neuronal network communication, slowing neuronal oscillations, and increased coupling of delta and theta phases to the amplitudes of gamma oscillations. Such changes were linked with the detection of hypersynchronous events like spike-and-wave discharges. These dysfunctions were associated with altered production and release of neurotransmitters, compromised activity of excitatory ionotropic receptors including receptors of kainate, AMPA, and NMDA, and changed levels and function of excitatory glutamatergic synapses and inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Neuronal properties that modulate GABAergic inhibition including the activity of Na-K-Cl cotransport 1 (NKCC1) in Cl- homeostasis and the levels of synaptic and extra-synaptic localization of GABA receptors (GABARs) were altered in the T21 COs only. The neurosteroid allopregnanolone, a positive modulator of GABARs, was downregulated in all the dCOs. Treatment with this neurosteroid significantly improved the neuronal communication in the dCOs, possibly through improving the GABAergic inhibition. Overall, without the manifestation of any disease-related pathology, the genetic mutations PRNPE200K, T21, and LRRK2G2019S significantly altered the neuronal network communication in dCOs by disrupting the excitatory-to-inhibitory balance.

DOI: 10.1016/j.jhep.2021.03.012	Golexanolone is a novel small molecule GABA-A receptor-modulating steroid antagonist under development for the treatment of cognitive and vigilance disorders caused by allosteric over-activation of GABA-A receptors by neurosteroids. It restored spatial learning and motor coordination in animal models of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and mitigated the effects of intravenous allopregnanolone in healthy adults in a dose-dependent fashion. Herein, we report data on the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of golexanolone in adult patients with cirrhosis.

Peak visual gamma frequency is modified across the healthy menstrual cycle.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.24069	Fluctuations in gonadal hormones over the course of the menstrual cycle are known to cause functional brain changes and are thought to modulate changes in the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition. Animal research has shown this occurs primarily via the major metabolite of progesterone, allopregnanolone, and its action as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. Our study used EEG to record gamma oscillations induced in the visual cortex using stationary and moving gratings. Recordings took place during twenty females' mid-luteal phase when progesterone and estradiol are highest, and early follicular phase when progesterone and estradiol are lowest. Significantly higher (∼5 Hz) gamma frequency was recorded during the luteal compared to the follicular phase for both stimuli types. Using dynamic causal modeling, these changes were linked to stronger self-inhibition of superficial pyramidal cells in the luteal compared to the follicular phase. In addition, the connection from inhibitory interneurons to deep pyramidal cells was found to be stronger in the follicular compared to the luteal phase. These findings show that complex functional changes in synaptic microcircuitry occur across the menstrual cycle and that menstrual cycle phase should be taken into consideration when including female participants in research into gamma-band oscillations.

Effects of allopregnanolone on sedation in men, and in women on oral contraceptives.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2007.03.009	Allopregnanolone is a known GABA(A) receptor agonist not previously given to men, or to women using oral contraceptives (OC). The effects of metabolites of sex hormones on the GABA(A) receptor are different between men and women. OC are known to change GABA(A) receptor subunit composition. These factors might play a role in the differential effect of allopregnanolone in men and women, and in women with or without OC. To study the sedative effect of and sensitivity to allopregnanolone in men and in women with OC, nine healthy men (mean age 24.6 years) and nine healthy women on OC (mean age 21.8 years) were given three, increasing, intravenous dosages (0.015, 0.03, and 0.045 mg/kg) of allopregnanolone. Saccadic eye velocity (SEV), subjective ratings, and electroencephalography (EEG) were used to evaluate the response to allopregnanolone. Repeated blood samples for analyses of serum allopregnanolone levels were drawn throughout the study day. Allopregnanolone decreased SEV more in women than in men, and increased subjective ratings of 'sedation'. The results in women on OC are similar to earlier results in women without OC. Subjective ratings of 'contentedness' decreased in men but increased in women. Serum levels of allopregnanolone were more highly increased in men compared to women. Other pharmacokinetic parameters were not different between sexes. On the EEG, beta power increased in men. In conclusion, men and women on OC reacted differently to allopregnanolone.

Progesterone-induced changes in sleep in male subjects.	DOI: 10.1152/ajpendo.1997.272.5.E885	Progesterone administration induces a reduction of the vigilance state in humans during wakefulness. It has been been suggested that this effect is mediated via neuroactive metabolites that interact with the gamma-aminobutyric, acidA (GABAA) receptor complex. To investigate the effects of progesterone administration on the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) in humans we made polysomnographic recordings, including sleep stage-specific spectral analysis, and concomitantly measured plasma concentrations of progesterone and its GABA-active metabolites 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone (allopregnanolone) and 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-dihydroprogesterone (pregnanolone) in nine healthy male subjects in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. Progesterone administration at 9:30 PM induced a significant increase in the amount of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The EEG spectral power during non-REM sleep showed a significant decrease in the slow wave frequency range (0.4-4.3 Hz), whereas the spectral power in the higher frequency range (> 15 Hz) tended to be elevated. Some of the observed changes in sleep architecture and sleep-EEG power spectra are similar to those induced by agonistic modulators of the GABAA receptor complex and appear to be mediated in part via the conversion of progesterone into its GABA-active metabolites.

Soporific effect of the neurosteroid pregnanolone in relation to the substance's plasma level: a pilot study.	DOI: 10.1159/000119300	The soporific effect of the neuroactive steroid pregnanolone, a metabolite of progesterone, and its relationship with plasma concentrations was assessed in 18 young, healthy, male volunteers for 2 h after administration of a single dose of pregnanolone prepared in two different formulations. Sedation was measured as sleep propensity and power increase in the low frequency delta band of the quantified EEG, based on 5-min polygraphic (EEG, EOG, EMG) recordings under resting conditions, which were performed immediately before, and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after intake of the study drug. With both formulations, there was a time-dependent increase in plasma concentration of pregnanolone with highest values 1-2 h postdosing. The model of short polygraphic recordings under resting conditions demonstrated soporific effects of pregnanolone. Compared to predosing baseline the number of sleep attempts and the time asleep increased after treatment with a peak 60 min postdosing. Quantitative EEG analysis revealed an increase of absolute amplitude in the delta frequency range with a comparable temporal pattern. Correlations between the soporific effect and plasma concentrations of pregnanolone suggest that the effects were drug-related, although this has to be replicated with placebo control.

"Human anxiety-specific ""theta"" occurs with selective stopping and localizes to right inferior frontal gyrus."	DOI: 10.1037/bne0000316	"Anxiety disorders have high prevalence and generate major disability. But they have poor treatment targeting because psychiatry lacks diagnostic biomarkers. Right frontal goal-conflict-specific-rhythmicity (GCSR) in the simple stop signal task appears homologous to hippocampal ""theta"" as an anxiety-process biomarker but is weak and transient. An anticipatory response inhibition task (ARIT) elicits strong subjective conflict and so might generate stronger GCSR. Healthy participants provided EEG during an ARIT, which allowed direct comparison of selective (left, SG; right, GS), and nonselective (both, SS) handed stopping. We assessed GCSR as intermediate versus the average of short and long delay stop-specific power. SG produced right frontal 5-12 Hz GCSR that, as in the SST: significantly correlated with trait anxiety and neuroticism; and was sensitive to pregabalin (75 mg), buspirone (10 mg), and perhaps triazolam (0.25 mg). GS and SS produced faster stopping and only 9-10Hz GCSR, which did not correlate significantly with trait anxiety or neuroticism and was sensitive to pregabalin and buspirone but not triazolam. Source localization suggested that GCSR, like stopping, involves multiple right frontal circuits that depend on response speed. Anxiolytic-sensitive GCSR generalizes from the speeded stop signal task to fixed-time anticipatory response inhibition tasks. GCSR, and the circuits engaged, vary with stop signal RTs conditions. Tasks with longer stop times may be optimal to generate GCSR homologous with rodent hippocampal theta as (a) the first direct anchor of a specific neural form of trait anxiety; (b) a single-dose screen in normal humans for novel anxiolytics; and (c) a potential clinical anxiety biomarker.

DOI: 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1995.tb04111.x	The safety and tolerability of dolasetron mesylate, a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, were evaluated after single intravenous doses in healthy male volunteers. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase I study, 80 subjects received either placebo or dolasetron in escalating doses (0.6 to 5.0 mg/k). Subjects were monitored for adverse events, vital sign and laboratory alterations, and changes in electrocardiographic (ECG) intervals and electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns. Overall, the percentage of subjects reporting adverse events was similar in those receiving dolasetron (44/64; 68.8%) or placebo (10/16; 62.5%); most adverse events were mild in severity. Subjects receiving dolasetron reported a higher incidence of central nervous system (headache and dizziness/lightheadedness), gastrointestinal (increased appetite and nausea), and visual adverse events and taste alterations. No clinically significant changes in laboratory variables were observed. Transient and asymptomatic ECG changes (small mean increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration versus baseline) were noted in several subjects at 1 to 2 hours after infusion at doses > or = 3.0 mg/kg.

Single dose human pharmacology of umespirone.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00191912	We have compared the cognitive, EEG, and neuroendocrine effects of single doses of umespirone (20 mg and 80 mg) with those of buspirone (30 mg) and placebo in double-blind, cross-over studies in 44 healthy men. The pattern and time-course of the cognitive effects with umespirone and buspirone were dissimilar. Peak effects of buspirone were seen shortly after dosing and then receded, whilst the effects of umespirone persisted for up to 23 h. Although both drugs objectively impaired attention, buspirone reduced subjective alertness, calmness, and contentedness, whilst umespirone increased subjective alertness and contentedness and showed potential to improve secondary verbal memory. The EEG effects of umespirone were different from those seen with buspirone; they included a decrease of power in the alpha 1 band and the beta bands in the frontocentral area and an increase in the delta and theta bands in the occipitotemporal area. Umespirone had a later onset of action than buspirone but its effects lasted longer. Similar transient increases in serum prolactin and growth hormone concentrations were seen with buspirone and 80 mg umespirone; umespirone 20 mg had no effect. Plasma concentrations of ACTH and adrenaline and serum concentrations of cortisol were unaffected by either dose of umespirone. There was some evidence that buspirone increased ACTH and cortisol concentrations in some cases, and that umespirone increased noradrenaline concentrations. The frequency of adverse events was higher with buspirone than with 80 mg of umespirone. At the lower dose of umespirone, the frequency was similar to that with placebo.

Sodium lactate differently alters relative EEG power and functional connectivity in Alzheimer's disease patients' brain regions.

Lactate is a metabolic vasodilator and is known to induce increased cerebral blood flow in healthy adults. The present study addresses the issue whether sodium lactate infusion affects functional state and resulting electroencephalographic patterns of AD patients. Twelve late-onset sporadic AD probands participated in this self-control study. The relative power and synchronization likelihood (SL) values of the electroencephalographic samples were calculated and compared off-line before and after sodium lactate infusion (0.5 M, 5 ml/kg body weight). Based on the reactivity to sodium lactate the scalp could be divided into three parts; no significant changes were seen in the seriously damaged (P3-P4) areas. The moderately affected regions in the close neighborhood showed a paradoxic inactivation with electroencephalographic slowing, a likely consequence of the metabolic-like steal effect of the near-normal areas outside. These results indicate a diminished vascular and/or metabolic reserve capacity to sodium lactate challenge in AD and confirm the formerly described electroencephalographic abnormalities.

Pharmacological mechanisms of interhemispheric signal propagation: a TMS-EEG study.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-019-0468-7	Interhemispheric connections across the corpus callosum have a predominantly inhibitory effect. Previous electrophysiology studies imply that local inhibitory circuits are responsible for inducing transcallosal inhibition, likely through inhibitory GABAB-mediated neurotransmission. We investigated the neurochemical mechanisms involved in interhemispheric connectivity by measuring transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced interhemispheric signal propagation (ISP) in the motor cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings under the pharmacological effects of baclofen, L-DOPA, dextromethorphan, and rivastigmine. We hypothesized that for both stimulated regions, GABAB receptor agonist baclofen would decrease ISP when compared against baseline while drugs that target other neurotransmitter systems (dopaminergic, acetylcholinergic, and glutamatergic systems) would have no effect on ISP. Twelve right-handed healthy volunteers completed this study and underwent TMS across five sessions in a randomized order. In the motor cortex, participants showed a significant decrease in ISP under baclofen, but not in the other drug conditions. There were no drug-induced changes in ISP in the DLPFC and baseline ISP did not differ across experimental sessions for both brain regions. Together, our results suggest that the inhibitory effects observed with interhemispheric signal transmission are mediated by a population of interneurons involving GABAB receptor neurotransmission. Inhibitory mechanisms of ISP may be more salient for motor-related functions in the motor cortex than for cognitive control in the DLPFC. These findings are a fundamental step in advancing our understanding of interhemispheric connectivity and may be used to identify treatments for disorders in which transcallosal transmission is dysfunctional.

Pharmacological Manipulation of Cortical Inhibition in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2017.104	Cortical inhibition (CI) occurs largely through GABA receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission, which can be modulated by cholinergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic inputs. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to index CI through a paradigm known as long-interval CI (LICI). When TMS is combined with electroencephalography (EEG), LICI can index GABA receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We conducted a hypothesis-driven pharmacological study to assess the role of cholinergic, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission on LICI from the DLPFC using TMS-EEG. In this randomized controlled, double-blind crossover within-subject study, 12 healthy participants received five sessions of LICI to the DLPFC in a random order, each preceded by the administration of placebo or one of the four active drugs. LICI was assessed after each drug administration and compared to LICI after placebo. Relative to placebo, baclofen resulted in a significant increase in LICI, while rivastigmine resulted in a significant decrease in LICI. Dextromethorphan and L-DOPA did not result in a significant change in LICI relative to placebo. Our study confirms that LICI in the DLPFC is largely mediated by GABAB receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission and also suggests that cholinergic modulation decreases LICI in the DLPFC. Such findings may help guide future work examining the neurophysiological impact of these neurotransmitters in healthy and diseased states.

DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.09.028	GABAB-receptor (GABABR) mediated inhibition is important in regulating neuronal excitability. The paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol of long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) likely reflects this GABABergic inhibition. However, this view is based on indirect evidence from electromyographic (EMG) studies. Here we combined paired-pulse TMS with simultaneous electroencephalography (paired-pulse TMS-EEG) and pharmacology to directly investigate mechanisms of LICI at the cortical level. We tested the effects of a conditioning stimulus (CS100) applied 100ms prior to a test stimulus (TS) over primary motor cortex on TS-evoked EEG-potentials (TEPs). Healthy subjects were given a single oral dose of baclofen, a GABABR agonist, or diazepam, a positive modulator at GABAARs, in a placebo-controlled, pseudo-randomized double-blinded crossover study. LICI was quantified as the difference between paired-pulse TEPs (corrected for long-lasting EEG responses by the conditioning pulse) minus single-pulse TEPs. LICI at baseline (i.e. pre-drug intake) was characterized by decreased P25, N45, N100 and P180 and increased P70 TEP components. Baclofen resulted in a trend towards the enhancement of LICI of the N45 and N100, and significantly enhanced LICI of the P180. In contrast, diazepam consistently suppressed LICI of late potentials (i.e. N100, P180), without having an effect on LICI of earlier (i.e. P25, N45 and P70) potentials. These findings demonstrate for the first time directly at the system level of the human cortex that GABABR-mediated cortical inhibition contributes to LICI, while GABAAR-mediated inhibition occludes LICI. Paired-pulse TMS-EEG allows investigating cortical GABABR-mediated inhibition more directly and specifically than hitherto possible, and may thus inform on network abnormalities caused by disordered inhibition, e.g. in patients with schizophrenia or epilepsy.

The role of GABAB receptors in human reinforcement learning.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2014.08.013	Behavioral evidence from human studies suggests that the γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABAB receptor) agonist baclofen modulates reinforcement learning and reduces craving in patients with addiction spectrum disorders. However, in contrast to the well established role of dopamine in reinforcement learning, the mechanisms by which the GABAB receptor influences reinforcement learning in humans remain completely unknown. To further elucidate this issue, a cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in healthy human subjects (N=15) to test the effects of baclofen (20 and 50mg p.o.) on probabilistic reinforcement learning. Outcomes were the feedback-induced P2 component of the event-related potential, the feedback-related negativity, and the P300 component of the event-related potential. Baclofen produced a reduction of P2 amplitude over the course of the experiment, but did not modulate the feedback-related negativity. Furthermore, there was a trend towards increased learning after baclofen administration relative to placebo over the course of the experiment. The present results extend previous theories of reinforcement learning, which focus on the importance of mesolimbic dopamine signaling, and indicate that stimulation of cortical GABAB receptors in a fronto-parietal network leads to better attentional allocation in reinforcement learning. This observation is a first step in our understanding of how baclofen may improve reinforcement learning in healthy subjects. Further studies with bigger sample sizes are needed to corroborate this conclusion and furthermore, test this effect in patients with addiction spectrum disorder.

TMS-EEG signatures of GABAergic neurotransmission in the human cortex.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5089-13.2014	Combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) constitutes a powerful tool to directly assess human cortical excitability and connectivity. TMS of the primary motor cortex elicits a sequence of TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs). It is thought that inhibitory neurotransmission through GABA-A receptors (GABAAR) modulates early TEPs (<50 ms after TMS), whereas GABA-B receptors (GABABR) play a role for later TEPs (at ∼100 ms after TMS). However, the physiological underpinnings of TEPs have not been clearly elucidated yet. Here, we studied the role of GABAA/B-ergic neurotransmission for TEPs in healthy subjects using a pharmaco-TMS-EEG approach. In Experiment 1, we tested the effects of a single oral dose of alprazolam (a classical benzodiazepine acting as allosteric-positive modulator at α1, α2, α3, and α5 subunit-containing GABAARs) and zolpidem (a positive modulator mainly at the α1 GABAAR) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. In Experiment 2, we tested the influence of baclofen (a GABABR agonist) and diazepam (a classical benzodiazepine) versus placebo on TEPs. Alprazolam and diazepam increased the amplitude of the negative potential at 45 ms after stimulation (N45) and decreased the negative component at 100 ms (N100), whereas zolpidem increased the N45 only. In contrast, baclofen specifically increased the N100 amplitude. These results provide strong evidence that the N45 represents activity of α1-subunit-containing GABAARs, whereas the N100 represents activity of GABABRs. Findings open a novel window of opportunity to study alteration of GABAA-/GABAB-related inhibition in disorders, such as epilepsy or schizophrenia.

LORETA functional imaging in antipsychotic-naive and olanzapine-, clozapine- and risperidone-treated patients with schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1159/000154474	The aim of our study was to detect changes in the distribution of electrical brain activity in schizophrenic patients who were antipsychotic naive and those who received treatment with clozapine, olanzapine or risperidone. We included 41 subjects with schizophrenia (antipsychotic naive = 11; clozapine = 8; olanzapine = 10; risperidone = 12) and 20 healthy controls. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was computed from 19-channel electroencephalography for the frequency bands delta, theta, alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2 and beta-3. We compared antipsychotic-naive subjects with healthy controls and medicated patients. (1) Comparing antipsychotic-naive subjects and controls we found a general increase in the slow delta and theta frequencies over the fronto-temporo-occipital cortex, particularly in the temporolimbic structures, an increase in alpha-1 and alpha-2 in the temporal cortex and an increase in beta-1 and beta-2 in the temporo-occipital and posterior limbic structures. (2) Comparing patients who received clozapine and those who were antipsychotic naive, we found an increase in delta and theta frequencies in the anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex, and a decrease in alpha-1 and beta-2 in the occipital structures. (3) Comparing patients taking olanzapine with those who were antipsychotic naive, there was an increase in theta frequencies in the anterior cingulum, a decrease in alpha-1, beta-2 and beta-3 in the occipital cortex and posterior limbic structures, and a decrease in beta-3 in the frontotemporal cortex and anterior cingulum. (4) In patients taking risperidone, we found no significant changes from those who were antipsychotic naive. Our results in antipsychotic-naive patients are in agreement with existing functional findings. Changes in those taking clozapine and olanzapine versus those who were antipsychotic naive suggest a compensatory mechanism in the neurobiological substrate for schizophrenia. The lack of difference in risperidone patients versus antipsychotic-naive subjects may relate to risperidone's different pharmacodynamic mechanism.

EEG Global Field Power spectrum changes after a single dose of atypical antipsychotics in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1023/b:brat.0000032866.20058.5c	Effects of four novel atypical antipsychotic drugs (olanzapine, perospirone, quetiapine, and risperidone) on scalp-recorded multi-channel EEGs were compared with two conventional antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine and haloperidol) and placebo in 14 healthy male volunteers. All subjects went through seven sessions. In each session, EEGs were recorded before and 2, 4 and 6 hours after drug administration. Global Field Power (GFP) in delta frequency band (1.5-6 Hz) increased around the time of peak serum concentration of quetiapine and risperidone compared to baseline. The increase of GFP in delta activity after quetiapine was significantly prominent in comparison to two other atypical antipsychotic drugs, perospirone and olanzapine, as well as to typical antipsychotic drugs, chlorpromazine and haloperidol (p<0.05). The increase in GFP of delta after risperidone was more prominent in comparison to after haloperidol (p<0.05). The greater sedative effects after quetiapine and risperidone may reflect the high affinity to A1 and H1 receptor bindings of these drugs. According to Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA), olanzapine increased the delta in the posterior region indicating a frontal shift of brain activity, suggesting that olanzapine may be useful against negative symptoms in schizophrenics.

Schizophrenia patients exhibited significantly higher P50 ratios than healthy subjects. When patients treated with different antipsychotics were compared, there were no differences in any of the neurophysiological findings.

Neurophysiological evidence of impaired self-monitoring in schizotypal personality disorder and its reversal by dopaminergic antagonism.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nicl.2016.05.019	Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder characterized by odd or bizarre behavior, strange speech, magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, and social anhedonia. Schizophrenia proper has been associated with anomalies in dopaminergic neurotransmission and deficits in neurophysiological markers of self-monitoring, such as low amplitude in cognitive event-related brain potentials (ERPs) like the error-related negativity (ERN), and the error positivity (Pe). These components occur after performance errors, rely on adequate fronto-striatal function, and are sensitive to dopaminergic modulation. Here we postulated that analogous to observations in schizophrenia, SPD individuals would show deficits in self-monitoring, as measured by the ERN and the Pe.

Upregulation of adenosine A2A receptors induced by atypical antipsychotics and its correlation with sensory gating in schizophrenia patients.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psychres.2012.04.021	Sensory gating deficits have been found in patients with schizophrenia and their unaffected relatives. However, the underlying neurobiological mechanism of this deficit remains unclear. Pre-clinical studies have implicated adenosine in sensory gating deficits in schizophrenia. Therefore, the current study investigated a possible relationship between peripheral adenosine A2A receptor (ADORA2A) and sensory gating indices (P50 measures) in medication-free schizophrenia (n=31) and healthy (n=21) groups. The effects of six-week antipsychotic treatment were examined. At baseline, schizophrenia patients showed impaired sensory gating compared to healthy controls. However, there was no significant difference in ADORA2A gene expression among groups. In addition, ADORA2A expression was not correlated with sensory gating at any time point. Following treatment, we found a significant upregulation of ADORA2A expression. Intriguingly, we observed a significant positive association between ADORA2A upregulation and baseline P50 amplitudes in the schizophrenia group. A main finding of the current pilot study is the upregulation of ADORA2A expression following treatment with antipsychotics. In addition, this upregulation was predicted by baseline P50 amplitude, an observation that awaits replication in an expanded sample.

Influence of aripiprazole, risperidone, and amisulpride on sensory and sensorimotor gating in healthy 'low and high gating' humans and relation to psychometry.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2014.102	Despite advances in the treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders with atypical antipsychotics (AAPs), there is still need for compounds with improved efficacy/side-effect ratios. Evidence from challenge studies suggests that the assessment of gating functions in humans and rodents with naturally low-gating levels might be a useful model to screen for novel compounds with antipsychotic properties. To further evaluate and extend this translational approach, three AAPs were examined. Compounds without antipsychotic properties served as negative control treatments. In a placebo-controlled, within-subject design, healthy males received either single doses of aripiprazole and risperidone (n=28), amisulpride and lorazepam (n=30), or modafinil and valproate (n=30), and placebo. Prepulse inhibiton (PPI) and P50 suppression were assessed. Clinically associated symptoms were evaluated using the SCL-90-R. Aripiprazole, risperidone, and amisulpride increased P50 suppression in low P50 gaters. Lorazepam, modafinil, and valproate did not influence P50 suppression in low gaters. Furthermore, low P50 gaters scored significantly higher on the SCL-90-R than high P50 gaters. Aripiprazole increased PPI in low PPI gaters, whereas modafinil and lorazepam attenuated PPI in both groups. Risperidone, amisulpride, and valproate did not influence PPI. P50 suppression in low gaters appears to be an antipsychotic-sensitive neurophysiologic marker. This conclusion is supported by the association of low P50 suppression and higher clinically associated scores. Furthermore, PPI might be sensitive for atypical mechanisms of antipsychotic medication. The translational model investigating differential effects of AAPs on gating in healthy subjects with naturally low gating can be beneficial for phase II/III development plans by providing additional information for critical decision making.

P50 gating at acute and post-acute phases of first-episode schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.09.018	Deficit in P50 sensory gating has repeatedly been shown in schizophrenia. In order to determine the contribution of trait and/or state features to P50 gating deficit in schizophrenia we evaluated the P50 gating in patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) at acute and post-acute phases. Subject groups comprised 16 patients with FES and 24 healthy controls. Patients were tested at the acute phase of the illness and retested at the post-acute phase when their positive symptoms improved. During the testing at the acute phase five patients were neuroleptic-naive and the others were taking atypical antipsychotics which were started recently in order to control the acute excitation. Patients were receiving risperidone, olanzapine or quetiapine treatment at the post-acute phase. P50 gating was impaired in patients at the acute phase compared to controls. However, at the post-acute phase P50 gating was increased compared to the acute phase, reaching to the gating values of controls. P50 gating improvement might be emerged from atypical antipsychotic medication, although this can only be definitively determined by randomized studies including different antipsychotics.

[11C]flumazenil binding is increased in a dose-dependent manner with tiagabine-induced elevations in GABA levels.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0032443	Evidence indicates that synchronization of cortical activity at gamma-band frequencies, mediated through GABA-A receptors, is important for perceptual/cognitive processes. To study GABA signaling in vivo, we recently used a novel positron emission tomography (PET) paradigm measuring the change in binding of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) site radiotracer [(11)C]flumazenil associated with increases in extracellular GABA induced via GABA membrane transporter (GAT1) blockade with tiagabine. GAT1 blockade resulted in significant increases in [(11)C]flumazenil binding potential (BPND) over baseline in the major functional domains of the cortex, consistent with preclinical studies showing that increased GABA levels enhance the affinity of GABA-A receptors for BDZ ligands. In the current study we sought to replicate our previous results and to further validate this approach by demonstrating that the magnitude of increase in [(11)C]flumazenil binding observed with PET is directly correlated with tiagabine dose. [(11)C]flumazenil distribution volume (VT) was measured in 18 healthy volunteers before and after GAT1 blockade with tiagabine. Two dose groups were studied (n = 9 per group; Group I: tiagabine 0.15 mg/kg; Group II: tiagabine 0.25 mg/kg). GAT1 blockade resulted in increases in mean (± SD) [(11)C]flumazenil VT in Group II in association cortices (6.8 ± 0.8 mL g-1 vs. 7.3 ± 0.4 mL g-1;p = 0.03), sensory cortices (6.7 ± 0.8 mL g-1 vs. 7.3 ± 0.5 mL g-1;p = 0.02) and limbic regions (5.2 ± 0.6 mL g-1 vs. 5.7 ± 0.3 mL g-1;p = 0.03). No change was observed at the low dose (Group I). Increased orbital frontal cortex binding of [(11)C]flumazenil in Group II correlated with the ability to entrain cortical networks (r = 0.67, p = 0.05) measured via EEG during a cognitive control task. These data provide a replication of our previous study demonstrating the ability to measure in vivo, with PET, acute shifts in extracellular GABA.

A genetic variation in the adenosine A2A receptor gene contributes to variability in oscillatory alpha power in wake and sleep EEG and A1 adenosine receptor availability in the human brain.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120345	The EEG alpha rhythm (∼ 8-13 Hz) is one of the most salient human brain activity rhythms, modulated by the level of attention and vigilance and related to cerebral energy metabolism. Spectral power in the alpha range in wakefulness and sleep strongly varies among individuals based on genetic predisposition. Knowledge about the underlying genes is scarce, yet small studies indicated that the variant rs5751876 of the gene encoding A2A adenosine receptors (ADORA2A) may contribute to the inter-individual variation. The neuromodulator adenosine is directly linked to energy metabolism as product of adenosine tri-phosphate breakdown and acts as a sleep promoting molecule by activating A1 and A2A adenosine receptors. We performed sleep and positron emission tomography studies in 59 healthy carriers of different rs5751876 alleles, and quantified EEG oscillatory alpha power in wakefulness and sleep, as well as A1 adenosine receptor availability with 18F-CPFPX. Oscillatory alpha power was higher in homozygous C-allele carriers (n = 27, 11 females) compared to heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the T-allele (n(C/T) = 23, n(T/T) = 5, 13 females) (F(18,37) = 2.35, p = 0.014, Wilk's Λ = 0.487). Furthermore, a modulatory effect of ADORA2A genotype on A1 adenosine receptor binding potential was found across all considered brain regions (F(18,40) = 2.62, p = 0.006, Wilk's Λ = 0.459), which remained significant for circumscribed occipital region of calcarine fissures after correction for multiple comparisons. In female participants, a correlation between individual differences in oscillatory alpha power and A1 receptor availability was observed. In conclusion, we confirmed that a genetic variant of ADORA2A affects individual alpha power, while a direct modulatory effect via A1 adenosine receptors in females is suggested.

IV ATP potentiates midazolam sedation as assessed by bispectral index.	DOI: 10.2344/0003-3006-61.3.95	In this study, by measuring bispectral index (BIS), we tested the hypothesis that intravenous adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) infusion would deepen the level of midazolam-induced sedation. Ten healthy volunteers underwent 2 experiments with at least 2 weeks' interval: immediately after intravenous bolus administration of midazolam (0.04 mg/kg), they received continuous infusion of either ATP infusion (100 μg/kg/min) or placebo (saline) for 40 minutes in a double-blind, randomized, crossover manner. Changes in BIS values and responsiveness to verbal command as well as cardiorespiratory variables were observed throughout the study periods. Administration of midazolam alone reduced BIS value from control: 97 ± 1 to 68 ± 18 at 25 minutes, which was accompanied by significant cardiopulmonary depressant effects, while maintaining responsiveness to verbal command (consciousness) throughout the study period. Coadministration of ATP with midazolam further reduced BIS value to 51 ± 13, associated with complete loss of consciousness without adverse effect on the cardiorespiratory systems. We conclude that the addition of ATP infusion to midazolam significantly enhances midazolam sedation without disturbing cardiorespiratory functions.

Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation increases brain intracellular pH and modulates bioenergetics.	DOI: 10.1017/S1461145713000084	Transcranial direct current stimulation is an emerging treatment for brain disorders but its mode of action is not well understood. We applied 10 min 1 mA anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) inside the bore of a 3 T MRI scanner to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 13 healthy volunteers (aged 19-28 yr) in a blinded, sham-controlled, cross-over design. Brain bioenergetics were measured from the left temporo-frontal region using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy before, during and for 20 min following tDCS. Brain pH rose during tDCS and remained elevated afterwards. Phosphomonoesters were significantly decreased while inorganic phosphate (Pi) also fell. Partial-least squares discriminant analysis of the data revealed two significantly different subject groups: one where phosphocreatine (PCr), ATP and Pi fell along with a larger increase in pH and one where PCr and ATP increased along with a smaller increase in pH and a slower and more sustained decrease in Pi. Group membership was predicted by baseline pH and ATP. We interpreted the effects of tDCS as driving two biochemical processes: cellular consumption of ATP causing hydrolysis of PCr via the creatine kinase reaction driving the increase in pH; synthesis of ATP and PCr by mitochondria with concomitant drop in Pi and phosphomonoester levels.

Postictal serum nucleotidases activities in patients with epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2008.11.020	Adenosine, a potent anticonvulsant, can be produced in the body by the hydrolysis of adenine nucleotides through the action of ecto- or soluble nucleotidases. Changes in nucleotide hydrolysis occur after pentylenetetrazol-induced epileptic events. We evaluated serum ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolysis rates and soluble nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDEase) activity at 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, and 12h following an epileptic event. Fifteen patients (seven female, eight male; mean age 15.5 years) were included in the study. The type of seizure was generalized in four patients and was localization related in the remaining 11. There were no differences in adenine nucleotide hydrolysis rates between patients and healthy subjects in the interictal stage. In comparison with controls, ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolysis rates were significantly increased at 5 min (53+/-1.4%, 79.2+/-2.8% and 37.0+/-2.6%, respectively) and up to 30 min following the epileptic event. In contrast to ADP and AMP, ATP hydrolysis remained significantly increased at 60 min (71.4+/-1.6%), returning to the basal level after 12h. Serum PDEase activity was also significantly higher in the patients than in healthy subjects, peaking at 15 min (61+/-2.9%) and remaining significantly increased up to 60 min (4.6+/-1.2%) following the epileptic episode. Globally, the variations in the postictal serum ADP hydrolysis rate almost overlapped those of AMP hydrolysis, whereas changes in the ATP hydrolysis rate overlapped those of PDEase activity. The clinical significance of this elevation in postictal soluble serum nucleotidase activity remains to be clarified. However, it is possible to hypothesize that the higher nucleotidase activity might play a role in the modulation of epileptic events.

Delayed onset of late movement-related cortical potentials and abnormal response to lorazepam in catatonia.	DOI: 10.1016/s0920-9964(99)00189-9	Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome with an inability to execute and terminate movements completely, leading consecutively to akinesia and posturing, which both respond almost immediately to benzodiazepines, i.e. gaba-potentiators like lorazepam. However, pathophysiological mechanisms of cortical motor and gaba-ergic dysfunction remain unclear. We therefore investigated movement-related cortical potentials (MRPs) and movement kinematics during a motor task before and after lorazepam. Ten akinetic catatonic patients were compared with 10 psychiatric (similar age, sex, medication, and underlying psychiatric disease but without catatonic syndrome) and 20 healthy controls. MRPs from frontal (F), central (C), and parietal (P) sites were recorded to obtain measures of early and late readiness potential and movement potential. Kinematic measures included parameters for amplitude of movements, peak velocity, average duration of movements, elevation angle, and angle velocity. The motor task consisted in self-initiated extension of the right index finger. All catatonic and psychiatric control patients received intravenous lorazepam (1mg), whereas healthy controls were subjected to a placebo-controlled (10 received lorazepam, 10 received placebo) double-blind study design.Catatonics showed a significantly delayed onset of late readiness and movement potential in central electrodes (Cz, C3) compared with psychiatric and healthy controls. This delayed onset correlated significantly with catatonic motor symptoms and movement duration. Lorazepam led to significantly stronger delays in onset of late readiness potential in left fronto-parietal (F3, C3, P3) electrodes in catatonic patients than in psychiatric and healthy controls. It is concluded that delayed latencies in late MRP components in catatonic patients may reflect their inability to execute and terminate movements completely. Differential and stronger response to lorazepam in catatonia suggests dysfunction in inhibitory control of cortical motor function with increased gaba-ergic sensitivity.

Effects of Lorazepam on the automatic online evaluation of sleep EEG data in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2007-979299	In earlier publications we described an automatic algorithm to detect rapid eye movement (REM) sleep from a single-channel EEG recording without using EMG or EOG information. This system consisted of an artificial neural network operating on the basis of preprocessed EEG data and was composed to provide a maximum of robustness for online applications. In the present study the influence of acute administration of lorazepam on the performance of the REM detection procedure was evaluated. Following an adaptation to laboratory conditions, sleep EEG data were obtained from healthy subjects in three nights each. On the evening of the second night the volunteers received a single dosage of 2.5 mg Lorazepam; the other two nights were drug-free. The sleep profile and the quantitative EEG data reflected the known changes following acute administration of benzodiazepines: during the treatment night the amount of non-REM sleep and the relative power of the EEG signal in the beta and gamma frequency bands was increased relative to the first night, while the amount of REM sleep was reduced. The night of drug discontinuation still showed some characteristics of the treatment night. The discordance rate of the REM detection algorithm relative to the manual evaluation ranged from 9% to 14.2% for the different nights. Surprisingly, the percentage of correctly classified time periods was even higher for the lorazepam night as compared to the other nights.

Multidrug comparison (lorazepam, triazolam, zolpidem, and zopiclone) in situational insomnia: polysomnographic analysis by means of the cyclic alternating pattern.	DOI: 10.1097/00002826-199706000-00010	Since homogeneous samples of insomniacs are difficult to recruit for pharmacotherapy studies, normal sleepers can be used to assess the protective effect of hypnotic drugs, under standardized nonconducive conditions. In particular, a noisy environment is a typical cause of situational insomnia that can be counteracted by a sedative-hypnotic agent. Six healthy middle-aged subjects (three men and three women), with no complaints about sleep, underwent a completely randomized double-blind series of 10 nocturnal polysomnograms with at least 72-h washout intervals. All subjects received a single dose of placebo, zolpidem 10 mg, zopiclone 7.5 mg, lorazepam 1 mg, and triazolam 0.25 mg both under basal and under perturbed conditions. For each individual, five recordings were carried out under basal conditions (sound pressure level not higher than 30 dB) and five recordings under acoustically perturbed conditions (continuous white noise at 55 dB). Sleep quality was assessed by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS). All recordings were scored according to conventional rules (macro-structure) and cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) methodology (microstructure). Statistical analysis was based on a repeated measures analysis-of-variance design integrated by Bonferroni adjusted probabilities. Under placebo, situational insomnia was confirmed by the significant increase in sleep fragmentation (intrasleep wakefulness) and by the significant enhancement of arousal instability (CAP parameters). In contrast to macrostructural information, CAP parameters were highly sensitive in detecting the perturbing effects of noise (mean CAP rate under placebo, 57%) and the protective action of hypnotic drugs during perturbation (mean CAP rate under active medication, 41%). Microstructural analysis enabled us to discriminate hypnotic drugs from placebo, nonbenzodiazepine compounds from benzodiazepine agents, and zopiclone from zolpidem. The latter, in fact, induced the lowest values of CAP rate both under basal (30%) and under noisy (39%) conditions and determined a significant decrease in electroencephalogram arousals. All CAP parameters were significantly correlated with the visual-analogue-scale scores for sleep quality. The use of CAP methodology in a highly standardized model of situational insomnia can be a valid alternative to conventional sleep scoring for the investigation of drug effects on disturbed sleep.

Benzodiazepine administration effect on EEG fractal dimension: results and causalities.	DOI: 10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627851	This work aims at examining the influence of lorazepam, an anxiolytic drug with sedative effects, on brain activity and specifically on EEG Fractal Dimension (FD). The main objective is to clarify the reasons for FD increase after drug intake and to establish a relationship between FD and EEG energy bands. 14 healthy subjects that received either 2.5mg of lorazepam (verum case) or placebo (placebo case) participated in the experiment. 20 EEG channels have been used. One-way ANOVA test revealed that lorazepam increases significantly both FD (p = 0) and beta energy band (p = 1.18E-013 for beta1 band and p = 2.29E-011 for beta2 band) and decreases alpha energy band (p = 0.05 for alpha1 and p = 0.0036 for alpha2), whereas there was not any significant difference on placebo subjects before and after drug intake. Moreover, correlation results indicate that there is a strong correlation between FD and beta energy band (mean correlation coefficient = 0.4120 for beta1 and 0.5358 for beta2) and a negative correlation between FD and alpha1 energy band (mean correlation coefficient -0.4930). Additionally, the mean correlation coefficient between FD and a combination of the different energy bands (beta1+beta2-alpha1) is 0.6185 and reaches value 0.684 for channels F7, T6, P4. These results indicate that there is a relationship between EEG energy bands and FD and provide a link between the classic spectral analysis and the complexity analysis.

Effects of rilmenidine and clonidine on the electroencephalogram, saccadic eye movements, and psychomotor function.		Rilmenidine is a novel oxazoline derivative that is effective in the treatment of hypertension. Studies in animals have indicated that rilmenidine may reduce blood pressure without the associated central alpha 2 side effects of clonidine. The aim of this double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the hypotensive and central sedative effects of single oral doses of rilmenidine (1 or 2 mg), clonidine (150 or 300 micrograms), and lorazepam (2.5 mg) in 12 healthy male volunteers. Drug effects were assessed with a test battery composed of resting electroencephalogram, auditory evoked responses (AERs), saccadic eye movements, psychomotor performance, and subjective ratings as well as blood pressure and heart rate. Rilmenidine and clonidine produced similar dose-dependent reductions in blood pressure without an effect on heart rate. Saccadic eye movements were not significantly impaired after rilmenidine (1 mg) treatment in contrast to after clonidine (150 micrograms) treatment. Peak saccadic velocity was impaired by all drugs except rilmenidine (1 mg), which was indistinguishable from placebo. The electroencephalographic spectral analysis also demonstrated greater sedation with lorazepam than with the other drugs and greater vigilance with placebo and rilmenidine (1 mg) than with lorazepam. AERs showed a differentiation in sedative effects between lorazepam and clonidine (300 micrograms) relative to placebo, rilmenidine (1 mg), and clonidine (150 micrograms). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that at lower doses, rilmenidine may act preferentially through imidazoline receptors, whereas at higher doses, alpha 2-adrenoceptors may become activated.

Enhancement of GABA-related signalling is associated with increase of functional connectivity in human cortex.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.20014	Structural or operational synchrony analysis with EEG was conducted in order to detect functional interaction between cortical areas during an enhanced inhibition induced by the GABAergic agonist lorazepam in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in eight healthy human subjects. Specifically, we investigated whether a neuronal inhibitory system in the brain mediates functional decoupling of cortical areas. Single-dose lorazepam administration resulted in a widespread increase in the inter-area functional connectivity and an increase in the strength of functional long-range and interhemispheric connections. These results suggest that inhibition can be an efficient mechanism for synchronization of large neuronal populations.

Validation of an EEG-derived spectral frequency index (SFx) for continuous monitoring of sleep depth in humans.		"Sleep in humans is classically assessed by recording a multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) in connection with an electrooculogram (EOG) and an electromyogram (EMG). In general, human sleep is manually staged into 6 categories (from awake through REM sleep to stage 4 reflecting deep sleep) on the basis of a visual inspection of EEG periods (epochs) of 20 - 30 s duration. This cumbersome methodology is still used in practice and for reference purposes. - The conversion of EEG-signals by means of Fast Fourier Transformation provides objective and reproducible information reflecting specific communicative features of the central nervous system. A special part of this information based on a specific algorithm is defined by the so-called spectral frequency index (SFx). This SFx-algorithm contains relationships among some particular EEG frequencies and provides objective percentage values about the state of consciousness of a person. In order to validate this new SFx-method, sleep as a physiological state of continuous alterations of consciousness and vigilance was chosen. A total of 36 nights of sleep from 18 healthy volunteers were staged manually by a scientist unaware of the protocol. The volunteers received either placebo or lormetazepam prior to commencement of the nocturnal recordings. The manually staged data were compared with the data obtained by the SFx-analysis. Both data sets SFx values and manually staged data were made comparable by averaging their values to a basic period length of 2 min duration giving 7960 pairs of data. The SFx data for sleep were found within a range from 35% to 100%. The SFx-medians of the manually staged data from ""awake"" to stage 4 were found in a decending order (""awake"": 83% (lower and upper quartile 78% / 87%);""REM"": 68% (63%/74%),""stage 1"" :63% (57%/70%),""stage 2"" :51% (47%/57%), ""stage 3"" :44% (42%/46%) and ""stage 4"" :42% (40%/44%).

Local and remote functional connectivity of neocortex under the inhibition influence.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.013	The current paper focuses on a relatively new and promising area of the study of EEG transformations during brain information processing based on the reduction of the signal to the discrete quasi-stationary segment sequences which may reflect individual brain microstates or discrete operations. In this framework, the complex brain functions require integration of several operations throughout the whole neocortex. However, the role of inhibitory brain systems in such processes is still unsettled. The effects of a single dose (30 microg/kg) of lorazepam on the operational activity of neuronal populations and on the temporal binding between them were examined in a double-blind randomized crossover placebo-controlled study with eight healthy volunteers. EEG measures at 20 channels were evaluated on two occasions: (1) eyes closed, (2) eyes open. In short, we conducted a two-by-two factorial study where one factor manipulated GABAergic neurotransmission (lorazepam vs. placebo), and the other factor was simply brain state (eyes closed vs. eyes opened). We were primarily interested in the main effect of lorazepam. In the present study, a connection between the mesoscopic level, described by the local functional processes (neuronal assemblies or populations) and the macroscopic level, described as a sequence of metastable brain states (remote functionally synchronized neuronal populations) was established. The role of inhibitory brain systems facilitated by lorazepam in the operational dynamics of neuronal populations and in the process of EEG structural synchrony (SS) (topological peculiarities) was addressed for the first time. It was shown that GABA signaling reorganized the dynamics of local neuronal populations and the remote functional connectivity between them.

Episodic waveforms in the electroencephalogram during general anaesthesia: a study of patterns of response to noxious stimuli.	DOI: 10.1177/0310057X1003800118	Previous studies of the electroencephalogram (EEG) during anaesthesia have identified two distinct patterns of change in response to a noxious stimulus, a classical arousal pattern and a paradoxical arousal pattern. We developed methods of EEG analysis to quantify episodic EEG patterns--namely sleep spindle-like ('10 Hz-score') and burst-suppression-like fluctuations in high frequencies ('high frequency variation index')--and used traditional power spectral quantification of non-episodic delta waves. We studied 30 healthy adult patients undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia with propofol, fentanyl (1.0, 2.5 or 4.0 microg/kg, n=10 for each group), muscle relaxant and sevoflurane. Prefrontal EEG data were recorded during the operation and analysed for changes in episodic patterns before and after noxious stimuli (intubation and incision). Before noxious stimuli, the EEG patterns varied markedly between patients and were not strongly correlated to calculated effect-site concentrations of fentanyl, propofol or sevoflurane. Noxious stimuli reduced the 10 Hz-score from 0.25 to 0.20 (P = 0.01) after intubation and from 0.33 to 0.27 (P = 0.01) after incision; and high frequency variation index from 2.8 to 2.0 (P=0.02) after incision--the classical arousal pattern. The nociception-induced reduction in spindles was greater in the low-dose fentanyl group (P = 0.01). There was less tachycardia in the high-dose fentanyl group (P = 0.002). It is possible to quantify such episodic EEG patterns during general anaesthesia and in this study noxious stimulation tended to reduce the prevalence of these patterns.

The pharmacodynamic effects of a lower-lipid emulsion of propofol: a comparison with the standard propofol emulsion.	DOI: 10.1213/01.ane.0000103184.36451.d7	"Using a randomized, double-blind protocol design, we compared a new lower-lipid emulsion of propofol (Ampofol) containing propofol 1%, soybean oil 5%, and egg lecithin 0.6% with the most commonly used formulation of propofol (Diprivan) with respect to onset of action and recovery profiles, as well as intraoperative efficacy, when administered for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia as part of a ""balanced"" anesthetic technique in 63 healthy outpatients. Anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.1 microg/kg (or fentanyl 1 microg/kg) and propofol 2 mg/kg IV and maintained with a variable-rate propofol infusion, 120-200 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). Onset times to loss of the eyelash reflex and dropping a syringe were recorded. Severity of pain on injection, speed of induction, intraoperative hemodynamic variables, and electroencephalographic bispectral index values were assessed. Recovery times to opening eyes and orientation were noted. The results demonstrated that there were no significant differences between Ampofol and Diprivan with respect to onset times, speed of induction, anesthetic dose requirements, bispectral index values, hemodynamic variables, recovery variables, or patient satisfaction. However, the incidence of pain on injection was more frequent in the Ampofol group (26% versus 6%, P < 0.05).

The effect of intraoperative use of esmolol and nicardipine on recovery after ambulatory surgery.	DOI: 10.1213/01.ANE.0000085296.07006.BA	There is controversy regarding the optimal technique for maintaining hemodynamic stability during anesthesia. We designed this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to test the hypothesis that the technique used for maintaining hemodynamic stability during general anesthesia can influence recovery after ambulatory surgery. Forty-five healthy consenting women undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy procedures were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Group 1 (control, n = 15) received normal saline 5 mL and 1 mL, followed by a saline infusion at a rate of 0.005 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1); Group 2 (n = 15) received esmolol 50 mg and saline 1 mL, followed by an esmolol infusion 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1); and Group 3 (n = 15) received esmolol 50 mg and nicardipine 1 mg, followed by an esmolol infusion 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). The study drugs were administered after the induction of anesthesia with fentanyl 1.5 microg/kg, and propofol 2 mg/kg I.V. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium 0.12 mg/kg I.V. Anesthesia was initially maintained with desflurane 2% end-tidal and N(2)O 67% in oxygen in all 3 groups. During surgery, the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained within +/-15% of the baseline value by varying the study drug infusion rate and the inspired concentration of desflurane. In addition to MAP and heart rate values, electroencephalogram bispectral index values were recorded throughout the perioperative period. Recovery times and postoperative side effects were assessed. Compared with the control group, adjunctive use of esmolol and nicardipine attenuated the increase in heart rate (in Group 2) and MAP (in Group 3) after tracheal intubation. Furthermore, the use of an esmolol infusion as an adjunct to desflurane to control the acute autonomic responses during the maintenance period significantly decreased emergence times (4 +/- 2 versus 7 +/- 4 min), decreased the need for postoperative opioid analgesics (43% versus 80%), and reduced the time to discharge (209 +/- 89 versus 269 +/- 100 min). We conclude that the adjunctive use of esmolol alone or in combination with nicardipine during the induction of anesthesia reduced the hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. Furthermore, use of an esmolol infusion as an adjuvant to desflurane-N(2)O anesthesia for controlling the acute hemodynamic responses during the maintenance period improved the recovery profile after outpatient laparoscopic surgery.

The concentration-effect relationship of the respiratory depressant effects of alfentanil and fentanyl.	DOI: 10.1097/00000539-200110000-00028	The relative potencies of fentanyl and alfentanil for respiratory depression were determined in eight healthy male volunteers in a double-blinded, randomized study with a cross-over design. The drugs were delivered by computer-driven infusion with logarithmically ascending plasma concentrations until the respiratory rate reached 2/min and/or oxygen saturation decreased below 85% with subjects breathing room air. Ventilation was measured with respiratory inductive plethysmography, indirect calorimetry, and arterial blood gas analysis, and plasma drug concentrations were determined. Pharmacodynamic modeling was performed using a fractional E(max) model for minute volume and respiratory rate and the concentrations producing 50% depression (i.e., apparent 50% effective concentration [EC(50)] values) were determined. Both drugs decreased ventilation in a similar manner, and drug infusions were terminated at mean +/- SD measured plasma concentrations of 254 +/- 88 ng/mL and 5.1 +/- 1.7 ng/mL for alfentanil and fentanyl, respectively. Alfentanil decreased minute volume from baseline by 54% +/- 19% and respiratory rate by 40% +/- 11% with EC(50) values of 234 +/- 57 ng/mL and 195 +/- 101 ng/mL. The respective decreases for fentanyl were 50% +/- 11%, 41% +/- 15%, and the estimated EC(50) values were 6.1 +/- 1.4 ng/mL and 3.5 +/- 1.4 ng/mL, respectively. Using the apparent EC(50) values, the calculated potency ratio for alfentanil:fentanyl was (mean and 95% confidence interval) 1:39 (1:31-1:46) for minute volume and 1:51 (1:34-1:68) for respiratory rate. This is analogous to the analgesic effect studied earlier. The findings support the notion of parallel analgesic and respiratory depressant effects of alfentanil and fentanyl. Therefore equianalgesic concentrations of both drugs will lead to equally pronounced respiratory depression.

Effects on the bispectral index during elective caesarean section: a comparison of propofol and isoflurane.		Awareness during general anesthesia has been a particular problem during caesarean section. About 7 percent of patients undergoing elective caesarean section have reported dreaming or recall of voices during the procedure. The bispectral index (BIS), a value derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG), has been shown to be useful in monitoring the depth of anesthesia. Supplementation of propofol or isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia has been shown to effectively reduce the incidence of awareness. However, the effects of propofol or isoflurane on the BIS index have not been fully investigated. We therefore designed this study to compare the effects of isoflurane or propofol supplementation on the BIS index in 24 healthy parturients undergoing elective caesarean section.

Nitrous oxide does not alter bispectral index: study with nitrous oxide as sole agent and as an adjunct to i.v. anaesthesia.	DOI: 10.1093/bja/82.6.827	We have studied the effect of nitrous oxide on bispectral index (BIS), calculated from a bipolar encephalogram. Inhalation of 70% nitrous oxide resulted in loss of consciousness in all healthy volunteers (n = 10) but no change in BIS. Brief inhalation up to 1.2% sevoflurane also resulted in loss of consciousness in volunteers (n = 5), but with sevoflurane, BIS decreased. BIS and the haemodynamic effects of adding nitrous oxide were also measured during coronary artery bypass surgery in patients (n = 10) receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions. Measurements were made after 0%, 33%, 66% and 0% nitrous oxide, just before skin incision and after sternotomy. Nitrous oxide caused no change in BIS. BIS may indicate a sufficient hypnotic depth to prevent awareness during surgery, but our study demonstrated that pharmacological unconsciousness-hypnosis can also be reached by mechanisms to which BIS is not sensitive. Thus BIS is a sufficient but not a necessary criterion for adequate depth of anaesthesia or prevention of awareness.

Pharmacokinetic/dynamic assessment in drug development: application to the investigational opioid mirfentanil.	DOI: 10.1097/00000539-199506000-00024	The safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the investigational partial opioid agonist, mirfentanil, were determined in a dose-escalating, Phase 1 study in healthy male volunteers. Hemodynamic, central nervous system, and respiratory monitoring were used for safety assessment. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was evaluated as a surrogate measure of drug effect. Butorphanol was chosen as the control drug. In the mirfentanil group (n = 8) the dose was increased in sequential subjects from 25 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 30 min to 450 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 15 min, and in the butorphanol group (n = 10) from 2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 30 min to 25 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 15 min. In the mirfentanil group, serious side effects were observed at plasma concentrations more than 2000 ng/mL: heart rates exceeded 130 bpm (n = 2), epileptiform EEG potentials (n = 2), and a convulsion (n = 1). The clearance of mirfentanil was high (5.8-7.2 L/min), and the volume of distribution large (247-348 L). The EEG of the subjects receiving mirfentanil showed no changes typical for opioids. Butorphanol however, caused intermittent slowing in the delta and theta ranges. The results of our study define the upper limit of safe plasma concentrations in future mirfentanil studies.

Fentanyl-induced electrocorticographic seizures in patients with complex partial epilepsy.	DOI: 10.3171/jns.1992.77.2.0201	"Although electrical seizure activity in response to opioids such as fentanyl has been well described in animals, scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings have failed to demonstrate epileptiform activity following narcotic administration in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine whether fentanyl is capable of evoking electrical seizure activity in patients with complex partial (temporal lobe) seizures. Nine patients were studied in whom recording electrode arrays had been placed in the bitemporal epidural space several days earlier to determine which temporal lobe gave rise to their seizures. The symptomatic temporal lobe was localized by correlating clinical and electrical seizure activity obtained during continuous simultaneous videotape and epidural EEG monitoring. In each patient, clinical seizures and electrical seizure activity were consistently demonstrated to arise unilaterally from one temporal lobe (four on the right, five on the left). During fentanyl induction of anesthesia in preparation for secondary craniotomy for anterior temporal lobectomy, eight of the nine patients exhibited electrical seizure activity at fentanyl doses ranging from 17.7 to 35.71 micrograms.kg-1 (mean 25.75 micrograms.kg-1). More importantly, four of these eight seizures occurred initially in the ""healthy"" temporal lobe contralateral to the surgically resected lobe from which the clinical seizures had been shown to arise. These findings indicate that, in patients with complex partial seizures, moderate doses of fentanyl can evoke electrical seizure activity. The results of this study could have important implications for neurosurgical centers where electrocorticography is used during surgery for the purpose of determining the extent of the resection."

Effects of nitrous oxide on cerebral haemodynamics and metabolism during isoflurane anaesthesia in man.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1399-6576.1992.tb03420.x	Seven normoventilated and five hyperventilated healthy adults undergoing cholecystectomy and anaesthetized with methohexitone, fentanyl and pancuronium were studied with measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and quantified electroencephalography (EEG) under two sets of conditions: 1) 1.7% end-tidal concentration of isoflurane in air/oxygen; 2) 0.85% end-tidal concentration of isoflurane in nitrous oxide (N2O)/oxygen. The object was to study the effects of N2O during isoflurane anaesthesia on cerebral circulation, metabolism and neuroelectric activity. N2O in the anaesthetic gas mixture caused a 43% (P less than 0.05) increase in CBF during normocarbic conditions but no significant change during hypocapnia. CMRO2 was not significantly altered by N2O. EEG demonstrated an activated pattern with decreased low frequency activity and increased high frequency activity. The results confirm that N2O is a potent cerebral vasodilator in man, although the mechanisms underlying the effects on CBF are still unclear.

Assessment of anaesthetic depth by clustering analysis and autoregressive modelling of electroencephalograms.	DOI: 10.1016/0169-2607(91)90038-u	The brain activity electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 30 healthy women scheduled for hysterectomy. The patients were anaesthetized with isoflurane, halothane or etomidate/fentanyl. A multiparametric method was used for extraction of amplitude and frequency information from the EEG. The method applied autoregressive modelling of the signal, segmented in 2 s fixed intervals. The features from the EEG segments were used for learning and for classification. The learning process was unsupervised and hierarchical clustering analysis was used to construct a learning set of EEG amplitude-frequency patterns for each of the three anaesthetic drugs. These EEG patterns were assigned to a colour code corresponding to similar clinical states. A common learning set could be used for all patients anaesthetized with the same drug. The classification process could be performed on-line and the results were displayed in a class probability histogram. This histogram reflected in all patients the depth of anaesthesia, when the concentration of the anaesthetic agent was adjusted either based on clinical signs or according to the protocol. This uniform display, where colours in a class probability histogram indicate the depth of anaesthesia, may in the future serve as on-line advice for the administration of anaesthetics. A comparison of multiparametric with single parametric methods, based on calculation of median, spectral edge and peak frequencies, questions the reliability of the single parametric methods in monitoring anaesthetic depth.

Spontaneous and TMS-related EEG changes as new biomarkers to measure anti-epileptic drug effects.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-022-05179-x	Robust biomarkers for anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) activity in the human brain are essential to increase the probability of successful drug development. The frequency analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, either spontaneous or evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS-EEG) can provide cortical readouts for AEDs. However, a systematic evaluation of the effect of AEDs on spontaneous oscillations and TMS-related spectral perturbation (TRSP) has not yet been provided. We studied the effects of Lamotrigine, Levetiracetam, and of a novel potassium channel opener (XEN1101) in two groups of healthy volunteers. Levetiracetam suppressed TRSP theta, alpha and beta power, whereas Lamotrigine decreased delta and theta but increased the alpha power. Finally, XEN1101 decreased TRSP delta, theta, alpha and beta power. Resting-state EEG showed a decrease of theta band power after Lamotrigine intake. Levetiracetam increased theta, beta and gamma power, while XEN1101 produced an increase of delta, theta, beta and gamma power. Spontaneous and TMS-related cortical oscillations represent a powerful tool to characterize the effect of AEDs on in vivo brain activity. Spectral fingerprints of specific AEDs should be further investigated to provide robust and objective biomarkers of biological effect in human clinical trials.

Diagnostics and treatment of children with acute seizures on paediatric intensive care unit.		218 children were admitted to paediatric clinic for acute seizures within last 5 years. Out of them, 14 children (7%) were admitted to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with repeated or prolonged seizures. Two children were hospitalized twice. The average age of children in time of admission was 12 months, most of the children were healthy before admission, had normal psychomotor development. The most frequent seizure manifestation was asymmetric clonic seizure. Hypoventilation and/or unconsciousness was the most frequent indication for PICU admission in addition to seizures. Febrile seizure was the most frequent diagnosis in children with shorter or less frequent episodes of seizure. Children with severe course and pharmacoresistant seizure were likely to have genetic diagnosis. The MRI scan was normal in most of the children, interictal EEG was mostly without specific finding.

Levetiracetam Alters Oscillatory Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease.	DOI: 10.3233/JAD-160742	Seizures occur at a higher frequency in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but overt, clinically obvious events are infrequent. Evidence from animal models and studies in mild cognitive impairment suggest that subclinical epileptic discharges may play a role in the clinical and pathophysiological manifestations of AD. In this feasibility study, the neurophysiological and cognitive effects of acute administration of levetiracetam (LEV) are measured in patients with mild AD to test whether it could have a therapeutic benefit. AD participants were administered low dose LEV (2.5 mg/kg), higher dose LEV (7.5 mg/kg), or placebo in a double-blind, within-subject repeated measures study with EEG recorded at rest before and after administration. After administration of higher dose of LEV, we found significant decreases in coherence in the delta band (1-3.99 Hz) and increases in the low beta (13-17.99 Hz) and the high beta band (24-29.99 Hz). Furthermore, we found trends toward increased power in the frontal and central regions in the high beta band (24-29.99 Hz). However, there were no significant changes in cognitive performance after this single dose administration. The pattern of decreased coherence in the lower frequency bands and increased coherence in the higher frequency bands suggests a beneficial effect of LEV for patients with AD. Larger longitudinal studies and studies with healthy age-matched controls are needed to determine whether this represents a relative normalization of EEG patterns, whether it is unique to AD as compared to normal aging, and whether longer term administration is associated with a beneficial clinical effect.

Lamotrigine and levetiracetam exert a similar modulation of TMS-evoked EEG potentials.	DOI: 10.1111/epi.13599	Antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment failures may occur because there is insufficient drug in the brain or because of a lack of relevant therapeutic response. Until now it has not been possible to measure these factors. It has been recently shown that the combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) can measure the effects of drugs in healthy volunteers. TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) comprise a series of positive and negative deflections that can be specifically modulated by drugs with a well-known mode of action targeting inhibitory neurotransmission. Therefore, we hypothesized that TMS-EEG can detect effects of two widely used AEDs, lamotrigine and levetiracetam, in healthy volunteers.

Bioequivalence of a novel minitablet formulation of levetiracetam.	DOI: 10.1055/s-0031-1297965	To investigate whether rapidly dissolving levetiracetam minitablets are bioequivalent to a single tablet of the same strength. 2 bioequivalence studies were carried out investigating the 1 000 mg and 1 500 mg strength of such novel medicinal products relative to single-unit film-coated originator tablets for reference. In each study, 16 young healthy subjects (8 males, 8 females) were investigated according to a 2,2,2-cross-over design with 1 week between periods for washout purposes. Each time, the plasma pharmacokinetics were profiled for 36 h after dosing.There were no relevant differences between the formulations with regard to tmax, apparent terminal half-life and the mean residence time. For the 1 000 mg strength, the estimated ratios of the true treatment means for test to reference were 1.008 (90% CI: 0.897-1.133), 1.010 (90% CI: 0.964-1.057), and 1.012 (90% CI: 0.965-1.062) for Cmax, AUC(0-tz), and AUC(0-∞), respectively; for the 1 500 mg strength, the respective ratio estimates were 0.960 (90% CI: 0.892-1.034), 1.005 (90% CI: 0.971-1.040), and 1.006 (90% CI: 0.970-1.042).Rapidly dissolving levetiracetam minitablets are bioequivalent with the originator single-unit reference tablets.

Epilepsy is related to theta band brain connectivity and network topology in brain tumor patients.	DOI: 10.1186/1471-2202-11-103	Both epilepsy patients and brain tumor patients show altered functional connectivity and less optimal brain network topology when compared to healthy controls, particularly in the theta band. Furthermore, the duration and characteristics of epilepsy may also influence functional interactions in brain networks. However, the specific features of connectivity and networks in tumor-related epilepsy have not been investigated yet. We hypothesize that epilepsy characteristics are related to (theta band) connectivity and network architecture in operated glioma patients suffering from epileptic seizures. Included patients participated in a clinical study investigating the effect of levetiracetam monotherapy on seizure frequency in glioma patients, and were assessed at two time points: directly after neurosurgery (t1), and six months later (t2). At these time points, magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded and information regarding clinical status and epilepsy history was collected. Functional connectivity was calculated in six frequency bands, as were a number of network measures such as normalized clustering coefficient and path length.

Comparison of motor activity and sleep in patients with complex partial seizures on levetiracetam treatment and a group of healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1155/2007/832769	Levetiracetam-treated patients commonly report daytime drowsiness, fatique, asthenia and decreasing of motor activity.

The effects of levetiracetam on objective and subjective sleep parameters in healthy volunteers and patients with partial epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-2869.2002.00301.x	Levetiracetam is a novel antiepileptic drug which has recently been released as an adjunctive treatment for partial epilepsy. In the two studies reported here we examined the objective and subjective effects of levetiracetam on sleep in 12 healthy volunteers and 17 patients [16 who could be evaluated for electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings] with a history of partial epilepsy on stable carbamazepine monotherapy. The studies were of a similar double-blind crossover placebo-controlled design with subjects' sleep being recorded in their own homes. The results from the two studies showed considerable similarities. In both, levetiracetam produced an increase in the time spent in stage 2 sleep, which in the patient study was accompanied by a decrease in the time spent in stage 4 sleep and in the volunteer study an increase in rapid eye movement (REM) latency. The subjective changes included reports that sleep was of a better quality with fewer awakenings and patients also reported that their sleep was more restful. Volunteers and patients did, however, feel less alert on waking in the morning. Therefore, both groups reported a decrease in awakenings after levetiracetam despite the finding from the EEG of no change in the actual number of awakenings. It may be concluded from both studies that levetiracetam does affect some indicators of subjective sleep perception, but does not influence objective sleep measures of sleep continuity. The results from the patient study during placebo add-on treatment also showed that patients on carbamazepine had a marked increase in SWS, an increase in stage 2 sleep and an increase in REM latency compared with healthy volunteers. Interestingly, levetiracetam also reduced bilateral epileptiform EEG activity, particularly in patients with more discharges.

Bifidobacterium longum with fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) treatment in minimal hepatic encephalopathy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.	DOI: 10.1007/s10620-006-9687-y	Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) describes patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis who have no clinical symptoms of brain dysfunction but perform worse on psychometric tests compared with healthy subjects. The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is controversial although ammonia has been found to induce cerebral dysfunction. Increased intestinal ammonia production is due to bacterial urease activity and the production of other toxin methabolities, such as mercaptans, thioles. This study assesses the clinical efficacy of Bifidobacterium longum plus fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) in the treatment of MHE. A total of 60 cirrhotic patients were randomly and equally divided into two groups receiving Bifidobacterium+FOS (17 males, 13 females; mean age, 46+/-11 years) or placebo (16 males, 14 females; mean age, 45+/-12 years), respectively. All patients underwent clinical and laboratory assessment psychometric tests and automated EEG analysis: neurophysiological assessment, liver function assessment, amd neuropsychological assessment. After 90 days of treatment, fasting NH(4) serum levels were significantly decreased (P=0.003), performance on Trail Making Test-A was significantly decreased (P=0.000), performance on Trail Making Test-B was significantly decreased (P=0.000), performance on the symbol digit modalities test was significantly improved (P<0.05), performance on block design was significantly improved (P=0.000), and performance on the MMSE test was significantly improved (P=0.000). We conclude that the improvement in biochemical and neuropsychological tests of the group treated with Bifidobacterium longum+FOS are interesting and merit further, close examination.

The effects of bromazepam over the temporo-parietal areas during the performance of a visuomotor task: a qEEG study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2011.03.095	This study investigated the effects of bromazepam on qEEG when 14 healthy subjects were asked to perform a visuomotor task (i.e., motor vehicle driving task). The subjects were exposed to two experimental conditions: the placebo (PL) and 6 mg of bromazepam (Br 6 mg), following a randomized, double-blind design on different days. Specifically, we observe absolute power extracted from qEEG data for theta band. We expected to see a decrease in absolute theta power in the temporal and parietal areas due to the influence of bromazepam for the experimental group when compared with the placebo group. We found a main effect for the condition factor for electrodes T3, T4, P3 and P4. We also observed a main effect for the period factor for electrodes P3 and P4. We observed that the ingestion of 6 mg of bromazepam induces different patterns in theta power at the temporal and parietal sites. We concluded that 6 mg of bromazepam was an important factor in the fluctuation of the activities in the temporal and parietal areas. We then hypothesize about the specific role of this drug during the execution of a visuomotor task and within the sensorimotor integration process.

Effects of a cognitive modulator in the theta and alpha asymmetry during a typewriting task: a sensorimotor integration perspective.	DOI: 10.1590/s0004-282x2009000200008	This study aimed to elucidate cortical mechanisms and to identify the areas where occur such mechanisms due to interaction between bromazepam and motor learning. The sample was composed of 45 healthy subjects randomly distributed in 3 groups: placebo (n=15), bromazepam 3 mg (n=15) or bromazepam 6 mg (n=15). To perform the experimental task, subjects sat comfortably at a distance of approximately 20 cm from the typewriter. The typewriter keyboard was covered with a wooden box to avoid visual information about the hands' position. The typewriting task was performed concomitantly with EEG recording. ANOVA two-way results indicated a decreased asymmetry in sensorimotor areas in the experimental groups. Our interpretation is that moderate doses of bromazepam may improve performance on tasks with predictable elements to promote stability of psychomotor functions, but may also impair performance on tasks executed in unpredictable environments.

The influence of bromazepam on cortical power distribution.	DOI: 10.1590/s0001-37652008000200012	The EEG has been widely employed in the assessment of electrophysiological changes induced by distinct medications. Its sensibility in detecting alterations produced by a specific substance may be enhanced by methods of quantitative analyses (qEEG). The present study aimed at investigating the modulatory effects of bromazepam on brain dynamics. The effects of bromazepam (3 mg) on EEG power distribution were tested in 10 healthy individuals, in a double-blind experiment. The electrophysiological measure was analyzed across experimental conditions, moments, and electrodes, in the delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands separately. A significant decrease of relative power was observed in delta and theta (main effect of condition). No interactions were observed. Although the expected anxiolytic EEG profile was not observed (increased beta and decreased alpha activity), this specific result may be related to other factors such as dosage used and the subjects' general physiological state, and not necessarily to the drug itself.

Bromazepam impairs motor response: an ERSP study.	DOI: 10.2174/187152711799219361	This study aimed to investigate the acute modulatory effect of bromazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative drug, on alpha and beta bands (8-35Hz) in primary motor areas (M1) through event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP). Ten healthy subjects were submitted to a cross-over double-blind design. Subjects performed a visuomotor task where they had to identify rapidly the ball launched horizontally and catch it quickly, while electroencephalographic activity was acquired. We found a statistically significant difference on the time windows of 2920 ms for 13Hz in the electrodes C3 and Cz, and on the time window of 2000 ms for 18Hz in the electrodes C3, when compared the bromazepam and placebo conditions. We concluded that the acute effects of bromazepam provoked changes in information process in the left M1 represented by electrode C3 in both 13 Hz and 18 Hz. Our paradigm is relevant for a better understanding of the brain dynamics due to the information related to bromazepam effects on sensorimotor processes. We consider this report an invitation to conduct more studies in order to associate electro-cortical activity and psychometric tests.

Responsiveness of sensorimotor cortex during pharmacological intervention with bromazepam.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2008.10.024	The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of bromazepam on EEG and the motor learning process when healthy subjects were submitted to a typewriting task. We investigated bromazepam due to its abuse by various populations and its prevalent clinical use among older individuals which are more sensitive to the negative effects of long half-life benzodiazepines. A randomized double-blind design was used with subjects divided into three groups: placebo (n=13), bromazepam 3mg (n=13) and bromazepam 6 mg (n=13). EEG data comprising theta, alpha and beta bands was recorded before, during and after the motor task. Our results showed a lower relative power value in the theta band in the Br 6 mg group when compared with PL. We also observed a reduction in relative power in the beta band in the Br 3mg and Br 6 mg when compared with PL group. These findings suggest that Br can contribute to a reduced working memory load in areas related to attention processes. On the other hand, it produces a higher cortical activation in areas associated with sensory integration. Such areas are responsible for accomplishing the motor learning task. The results are an example of the usefulness of integrating electrophysiological data, sensorimotor activity and a pharmacological approach to aid in our understanding of cerebral changes produced by external agents.

Gamma band oscillations under influence of bromazepam during a sensorimotor integration task: an EEG coherence study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.11.062	The goal of the present study was to explore the dynamics of the gamma band using the coherence of the quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) in a sensorimotor integration task and the influence of the neuromodulator bromazepam on the band behavior. Our hypothesis is that the needs of the typewriting task will demand the coupling of different brain areas, and that the gamma band will promote the binding of information. It is also expected that the neuromodulator will modify this coupling. The sample was composed of 39 healthy subjects. We used a randomized double-blind design and divided subjects into three groups: placebo (n=13), bromazepam 3mg (n=13) and bromazepam 6 mg (n=13). The two-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated a main effect for the factors condition (i.e., C4-CZ electrode pair) and moment (i.e., C3-CZ, C3-C4 and C4-CZ pairs of electrodes). We propose that the gamma band plays an important role in the binding among several brain areas in complex motor tasks and that each hemisphere is influenced in a different manner by the neuromodulator.

Effect of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral and rectal bromazepam: an application of electroencephalography as the pharmacodynamic method.	DOI: 10.1177/00912700222011229	Quantitative analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) is used increasingly to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of benzodiazepines. The present study aimed to apply the EEG method as well as more traditional approaches to an interaction study of bromazepam and fluconazole. Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover study. The subjects received single oral or rectal doses of bromazepam (3 mg) after 4-day pretreatment of oral fluconazole (100 mg daily) or its placebo. Plasma bromazepam concentrations were measured before and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 22, 46, and 70 hours after bromazepam administration. Pharmacodynamic effects of bromazepam were assessed using self-rated drowsiness, continuous number addition test, and EEG. Fluconazole caused no significant changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral or rectal bromazepam. Rectal administration significantly increased AUC (1.7-fold, p < 0.0001) and Cmax (1.6-fold, p < 0.0001) of bromazepam. These changes following rectal dose may be due to avoidance of degradation occurring in the gastrointestinal tract. Rectal bromazepam also increased the area under the effect curves assessed by EEG (p < 0.05) and subjective drowsiness (p < 0.05). EEG effects were closely correlated with mean plasma bromazepam concentrations (r = 0.92, p < 0.001 for placebo; r = 0.89, p < 0.0001 for fluconazole). Thus, the EEG method provided pharmacodynamic data that clearly reflected the pharmacokinetics of bromazepam.

Consequently, they have been widely employed in the pharmacological treatment of several disorders. Nevertheless, few studies have analyzed the effects of bromazepam in electroencephalographic activity (EEG). The present study aimed at investigating the modulatory effects of this drug on brain dynamics. Specifically, the effects of bromazepam (3mg) on EEG coherence were tested in a double-blind experiment. The sample, consisting of 10 healthy subjects (5 male and 5 female), was submitted to ten minutes of EEG recording.

Absolute Theta Power in the Frontal Cortex During a Visuomotor Task: The Effect of Bromazepam on Attention.	DOI: 10.1177/1550059414535576	Bromazepam is a benzodiazepine, which has been widely employed in the treatment of anxiety. We investigated the electrophysiological changes in absolute theta power within the frontal cortex when individuals performed a visuomotor task under bromazepam. The sample of 17 healthy individuals was randomized into 2 experimental conditions, under which bromazepam 6 mg and placebo were administered on different days. All subjects were right -handed, with no mental or physical illness and were not using any psychoactive or psychotropic substance during the entire period of the study. We found an increase in reaction time under bromazepam compared with placebo . With regard to the electrophysiological variable, we found a lower theta power value in the prefrontal cortex prior to task execution, compared with after. We therefore suggested that this could be an increase of neural activity in this region, because of the subjects' readiness to perform the task, that is, because of their higher alertness. The right lateral frontal region showed lower theta power under bromazepam for pre- and post-finger movement. This could have occurred because of more effort to execute the task. In the left frontal region: premovement did not demonstrate any difference between conditions, possibly because the proposed task was simple to execute. In conclusion, theta power plays an important role in the analysis of visuomotor performance, assuming that bromazepam causes impairment on sustained attention and sensory perception.

Neuromodulatory effect of bromazepam on motor learning: an electroencephalographic approach.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2006.08.028	To investigate the effects of bromazepam on motor performance and electroencephalographic activity (qEEG) in healthy subjects, during the process of learning a typewriting task, with a focused attention demand. A randomized double-blind model was used to allocate subjects in one of the following conditions: placebo (n=13), bromazepam 3 mg (n=13) or bromazepam 6 mg (n=13). Forty minutes after treatment administration, subjects were submitted to the motor task. EEG activity was recorded simultaneously. The analyzed variables were: number of errors and execution time, which were extracted from each block of the typewriting task, and mean relative power values in the beta band (13-35 Hz), extracted from the qEEG. A significantly lower number of typing errors was observed in both bromazepam conditions (Br 3 mg and Br 6 mg) when compared to the placebo. There was no difference between the two bromazepam conditions. For the execution time variable, a better performance was observed in the Br 3 mg condition, but with no statistical significance. The highest degree of cortical activation during the task was observed in Br 3 mg and Br 6 mg when compared to placebo. The medication's anxiolytic effect intensifies the attentional focus over predictable events occurring in reduced perceptual fields. The qEEG's accentuated response in pre-motor and primary motor areas suggests a greater effort directed to the most relevant aspects of the task. In short, the doses employed (3 and 6 mg) seem to enhance the learning of motor tasks that involve focused attention, such as typewriting.

Topiramate effects on the EEG and alertness in healthy volunteers: a different profile of antiepileptic drug neurotoxicity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.yebeh.2006.12.011	Previous quantitative EEG (QEEG) studies of carbamazepine (CBZ), oxcarbazepine (OXC), and phenytoin (PHT) revealed a pattern of EEG slowing and an increase in drowsiness on the awake maintenance task (AMT). EEG slowing has been shown to correlate with negative effects on cognitive tests. Topiramate (TPM) is a novel AED with relatively large negative effects on cognitive function. We tested the hypothesis that TPM would induce significant slowing of EEG background rhythms and an increase in AMT drowsiness.

Effects of oxcarbazepine and phenytoin on the EEG and cognition in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/j.yebeh.2004.07.011	We studied the EEG and cognitive effects of oxcarbazepine (OXC) and phenytoin (PHT) using a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group design. Thirty-two healthy volunteers received a maximum of 1200 mg of OXC or 360 mg of PHT. EEG and cognitive testing were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. For each subject and measure, test-retest Z scores were calculated from regression equations derived from 73 healthy controls. Twenty-six subjects completed the study. Both the OXC and PHT groups had significant slowing of the EEG peak frequency and increased relative theta and delta power. Differences between AEDs (antiepileptic drugs) were not significant. Significant cognitive effects were seen on 5 of 20 measures, primarily measures of motor speed and reaction time. Again, there were no significant differences between AEDs. The only significant difference between AEDs was for the POMS-Vigor scale, favoring OXC. The small sample size may have contributed to the lack of significant differences between AEDs.

Increased depressant effect of phenytoin sodium as compared to carbamazepine on cortical excitability: a transcranial magnetic evaluation.		To evaluate the effect of monotherapy (phenytoin sodium (DPH) and carbamazepine (CBZ) on the threshold intensity (TI), cortical latency (CL), central conduction time (CCT), using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was used for recording the motor-evoked potentials (MEP) from the thenar muscles of both hands, in 36 patients with well-controlled epilepsy on monotherapy, with normal EEG and imaging studies. The TI, CL, CCT and the MEP amplitude were recorded and compared with 20 healthy controls. The threshold intensity was significantly higher in patients on DPH, (P< 0.05) with a significant decrease in the MEP amplitude when compared with controls (P< 0.05). Anticonvulsants alter the excitability of human motor pathways in epileptic subjects. This effect differs among the drugs used; DPH had a greater depressant effect on the excitability than CBZ in the present study.

Clinical policy: Critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures.	DOI: 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2004.01.017	This clinical policy focuses on critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with seizures. The medical literature was reviewed for articles that pertained to the critical questions posed. Subcommittee members and expert peer reviewers also supplied articles with direct bearing on this policy. This clinical policy focuses on 6 critical questions: What laboratory tests are indicated in the otherwise healthy adult patient with a new-onset seizure who has returned to a baseline normal neurologic status?Which new-onset seizure patients who have returned to a normal baseline require a head computed tomography (CT) scan in the emergency department (ED)?Which new-onset seizure patients who have returned to normal baseline need to be admitted to the hospital and/or started on an antiepileptic drug?What are effective phenytoin or fosphenytoin dosing strategies for preventing seizure recurrence in patients who present to the ED after having had a seizure with a subtherapeutic serum phenytoin level?What agent(s) should be administered to a patient in status epilepticus who continues to seize after having received benzodiazepine and phenytoin?When should electroencephalographic (EEG) testing be performed in the ED? Recommendations for patient management are provided for each 1 of these topics on the basis of strength of evidence (Level A, B, or C). Level A recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty; Level B recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect moderate clinical certainty; and Level C recommendations represent other patient management strategies based on preliminary, inconclusive, or conflicting evidence, or based on consensus of the members of the Clinical Policies Committee.

Assessment of drowsiness in epilepsy patients receiving chronic antiepileptic drug therapy.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1996.tb00010.x	Drowsiness is a common complaint among patients with epilepsy taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and may be of particular importance because of the potential effects on cognitive abilities. We used a novel EEG-based measure (the Awake Maintenance Task, AMT) to determine objectively whether patients on chronic, stable AED therapy had impaired ability to maintain wakefulness. Thirty patients receiving AEDs [carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbital (PB), valproate (VPA)] were compared to 35 healthy controls, 12 seizure patients not taking AEDs, and 16 patients with multiple sclerosis. A structured EEG recording was conducted under controlled conditions, and subjects were tested to determine their ability to maintain wakefulness during a 6-min unstimulated trial. Testing also included Digit Symbol, auditory reaction time, and subjective measures of fatigue or sleepiness [Profile of Mood States (POMS), Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS)]. Patients receiving AEDs had a mean total drowsiness score of 101 s compared with < or = 12 s for each of the three control groups (P < 0.001). One third of the AED-treated patients had > 120 s of drowsiness, in contrast to only 1 of 63 controls (p < 0.001). Among patients receiving AEDs, objective EEG drowsiness did not correlate with AED levels or performance measures. Untreated seizure patients had significantly greater complaints of lack of vigor despite a near absence of objective drowsiness on the AMT. These results suggest that epilepsy patients receiving chronic AED therapy have impaired ability to maintain wakefulness. Patient self-reports of AED-related sleepiness may not accurately represent this problem.

Intraindividual analysis of antiepileptic drug effects on EEG background rhythms.	DOI: 10.1016/0013-4694(94)90090-6	Antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy with either phenytoin or carbamazepine has been associated with generalized slowing of EEG background rhythms. These effects have been seen in groups of patients undergoing AED manipulation, although the background slowing has been highly variable from patient to patient. Background slowing may represent an objective physiologic measure of drug impact on cerebral function and could be useful in monitoring for AED neurotoxicity in individual patients. This would require an intraindividual analysis of AED effects on EEG background rhythms. The present study was designed to develop a methodology for intraindividual analysis of EEG background changes and to apply this methodology to patients beginning or ending chronic AED therapy. EEG recordings were obtained under controlled conditions in 31 healthy subjects and were repeated after an interval of 12-16 weeks. EEG background rhythms from each record were analyzed using the fast Fourier transform, and test-retest differences for several quantitative measures were calculated from each subject's paired recordings. EEG recordings were also obtained in 6 patients beginning or ending chronic AED therapy. Test-retest differences for each patient's quantitative EEG measures were statistically compared with the distributions of test-retest measures obtained from the healthy controls. AED therapy was associated with an increase in absolute delta and/or theta power and a slowing of the dominant posterior rhythm; however, these EEG background changes varied widely in degree from patient to patient. Intraindividual analysis revealed that 5 patients had statistically significant slowing relative to the control group on at least 1 of the 9 target quantitative EEG measures, as well as a composite measure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Anticonvulsantstherapeutic use', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'Epilepsydrug therapyphysiopathology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7511500/	['Phenytoin', 'Carbamazepine']	[1775, 2554]	7511500	['1994', 'Mar']
Sex hormones, gonadotropins and prolactin in male epileptic subjects in remission: role of the epileptic syndrome and of antiepileptic drugs.	DOI: 10.1159/000119132	Sex steroid peripheral pattern, pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, gonadotropin and prolactin responses to LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) were studied in 35 male epileptics treated with phenobarbital (PB), carbamazepine (CBZ), or phenytoin (PHT), and in age-matched healthy males. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) was diagnosed in 12 cases and partial epilepsy (PE) in 23 cases. Patients were seizure-free and did not show EEG abnormalities at repeated controls in the last 5 years, so that interfering effects of seizures were possibly excluded. The aim of the study was to evaluate both the role of epileptic syndromes and of anti-epileptic drugs on the endocrine function. Changes in sex hormone binding globulin, total and free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and delta 4-androstenedione were found to be independent of the epileptic syndrome type. The LH response to LHRH was lower in PB-treated PE than in IGE subjects on the same drug regimen. An impairment of LH pulsatility with respect to controls was found in PE but not in IGE patients taking PB. Among antiepileptic drugs, PHT is associated with higher sex hormone binding globulin and estradiol and lower free testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels. PB and CBZ, but not PHT, blunt the LH response to exogenous LHRH in PE. Prolactin responses to TRH were consistently enhanced in PE subjects treated with CBZ or PHT.

Withdrawal of antiepileptic medication in children--effects on cognitive function: The Multicenter Holmfrid Study.	DOI: 10.1212/wnl.43.1_part_1.41	"We present 100 children diagnosed with epilepsy who were seizure-free for more than 1 year and still on monotherapy of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). We matched each child with a healthy classmate and performed neuropsychological testing and EEG before and after complete withdrawal of the AEDs. The withdrawal phase lasted 3 months, but the dose decrease was individualized for each patient. Three to 4 months after complete withdrawal of the drug all patients were reassessed. Patients with seizure relapse are excluded from the study. Seventeen patients are regarded as dropout, 11 because of seizure relapse and six because of protocol violation. The remaining 83 patients were treated with carbamazepine (n = 56), valproic acid (n = 17), or phenytoin (n = 10). Serum concentrations of the AEDs were measured using peak plasma levels that were taken immediately before or after psychological testing. We used neuropsychological tests to assess psychomotor function and ""central"" cognitive processing such as information processing or memory function. We found significant improvement attributable to drug withdrawal on only one of the cognitive tests, namely, psychomotor speed, suggesting that the impact of AED treatment on higher-order cognitive function is rather limited. In addition, we found group differences between the epilepsy group and the control group at baseline that persisted after drug withdrawal. Subsequent analysis showed some factors that may have contributed to these group differences. First, patients with a former diagnosis of absence seizures show lower scores both at baseline and after drug withdrawal. We may assume that the seizure propensity has not disappeared completely in these patients. Some evidence is found that phenytoin may have a different cognitive profile than carbamazepine, with more impairment on tests that measure motor and mental speed. Again, this impairment persists after drug withdrawal."

Effects of carbamazepine and phenytoin on EEG and memory in healthy adults.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1993.tb02389.x	Using a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, we investigated the effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) and phenytoin (PHT) on memory and spectral EEG components in 15 healthy adults. Each subject was treated with each drug for 1 month, separated by a 1-month washout. Evaluations were conducted at baseline, at the end of each treatment month, and 1 month after the last treatment phase. EEG was collected during an eyes-closed resting condition and a verbal memory activation task. Spectral analysis of the EEG in the nondrug conditions showed that the memory task significantly reduced theta components and increased delta components. As compared with nondrug conditions, the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) significantly impaired memory performance and produced mild EEG slowing. Memory performance did not differ statistically between the AEDs, but minor differences in spectral EEG components were noted. The results suggest that differences in the cognitive and EEG effects of CBZ and PHT are not clinically significant.

Advanced Alzheimer's disease is a risk factor for late-onset seizures.	DOI: 10.1001/archneur.1990.00530080029006	To determine the role of Alzheimer's disease as a causative factor for late-onset epilepsy, 44 subjects with mild senile dementia of the Alzheimer type and 58 healthy control subjects were examined over a 90-month period for the development of focal or generalized seizure activity (excluding myoclonus). At entry, all subjects were free of prior seizures and other neurologic, medical, and psychiatric disorders with the potential to impair cognition. Although no control subject developed seizures during the study period, 7 subjects with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type had at least one documented seizure. All 7 subjects had progressed to the severe stage of dementia by the time of the first seizure. Seizures were generalized tonic-clonic in type and were unassociated with clinical or (in 3 subjects) neuropathologic evidence for epileptogenic factors other than Alzheimer's disease. We conclude that advanced Alzheimer's disease alone may be an important risk factor for new-onset seizures in older adults.

The pharmacological effects of ginkgo biloba, a plant extract, on the brain of dementia patients in comparison with tacrine.		"In 1994, a standardized dry extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves (SeGb), has been approved by German health authorities for the treatment of primary degenerative dementia and vascular dementia. More than 24 different brands of Ginkgo biloba extract are sold in the United States. Tacrine, also known as tetrahydroaminoacrine (THA), and donepezil are currently the only drugs approved in the United States for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies demonstrated that SeGb and tacrine induce significant pharmacological effects on the brains of young, healthy human males, as determined by bioelectrical activity measurements obtained using the quantitative pharmaco-electroencephalogram (QPEEG) method. The type of central nervous system (CNS) effects we have seen on computer-analyzed EEGs (CEEGs) after administration of tacrine or EGb suggests both are ""cognitive activators"" which are, as a class of products, characterized by a (prepost) relative increase of 7.5 to 13 Hz (""alpha"") and decrease of 1.3 to 7.5 Hz (""delta"" and ""theta"") activity. To determine whether EGb or tacrine had noticeable pharmacological effects on elderly subjects diagnosed with possible or probable Alzheimer's, the present open, uncontrolled trial was conducted. Data from 18 subjects (11 males, 7 females) at an average age of 67.4 years with light to moderate dementia (Mini Mental mean score = 23.7, ranges: 15-29 [Geriatric Depression Scale mean scores = 3.7; range: 3.2-5.4]) were analyzed for this presentation. Each subject was randomly administered a single oral ""Test-Dose"" of either 40 mg of tacrine or 240 mg of EGb2 in two separate sessions within 3- to 7-day intervals. Before drug administration and at 1- and 3-hour intervals after drug administration, CEEGs were recorded for a minimum of 10 minutes. The CEEGs were analyzed using Period Analysis programs we developed for QPEEG. The results indicated that both EGb and, to a lesser degree, tacrine induced pharmacological effects, as established by QPEEG measurements, in the CNS similar to those previously established in healthy, young subjects. The type of CNS effects produced by EGb (as established by HZI's CEEG psychotropic drug database) in elderly dementia patients were similar to those induced by tacrine responders as well as those seen after the administration of other ""cognitive activators"" (pramiracetam, vinpocetine, BMY-21502, suloctidil, and lisuride) and anti-dementia drugs approved in the United States or Europe (tacrine, donepezil, nimodipine, piracetam, and oxiracetam) from our database. The results also showed that 240 mg of EGb has typical cognitive activator CEEG profiles (responders) in more subjects (8 of 18) than 40 mg tacrine (3 of 18 subjects). Because of the small sample size, we could not test the hypothesis that subjects who showed cognitive activator-type pharmacological response to the first Test-Dose of EGb or tacrine also exhibit more therapeutic effects (compared to nonresponders) when drugs are administered chronically."

AD patients as well as controls had a baseline EEG recording and next day another recording 90 minutes after a peroral single dose of 50 mg THA. The relative change from the baseline in the alpha-theta ratio was the most sensitive discriminator of responders and nonresponders (P = 0.004, ANOVA).

CDP-choline and galantamine, a personalized α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor targeted treatment for the modulation of speech MMN indexed deviance detection in healthy volunteers: a pilot study.	DOI: 10.1007/s00213-020-05646-1	The combination of CDP-choline, an α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) agonist, with galantamine, a positive allosteric modulator of nAChRs, is believed to counter the fast desensitization rate of the α7 nAChRs and may be of interest for schizophrenia (SCZ) patients. Beyond the positive and negative clinical symptoms, deficits in early auditory prediction-error processes are also observed in SCZ. Regularity violations activate these mechanisms that are indexed by electroencephalography-derived mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to auditory deviance.

Combining CDP-choline and galantamine: Effects of a selective α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist strategy on P50 sensory gating of speech sounds in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881119836217	Schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and relatives have deficits in early cortical sensory gating (SG) typically measured by suppression of electroencephalography-derived P50 event-related potentials (ERPs) in a conditioning-testing (S1-S2) paradigm. Associated with alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) dysfunction and shown to be improved with nicotine and α7 nAChR agonists, SG has recently been shown to be improved in low P50 suppressing SCZ patients following acute CDP-choline treatment.

Combining CDP-choline and galantamine, an optimized α7 nicotinic strategy, to ameliorate sensory gating to speech stimuli in schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2019.02.005	Neural α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression and functioning deficits have been extensively associated with cognitive and early sensory gating (SG) impairments in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and their relatives. SG, the suppression of irrelevant and redundant stimuli, is measured in a conditioning-testing (S1-S2) paradigm eliciting electroencephalography-derived P50 event-related potentials (ERPs), the S2 amplitudes of which are typically suppressed relative to S1. Despite extensive reports of nicotine-related improvements and several decades of research, an efficient nicotinic treatment has yet to be approved for SCZ. Following reports of SG improvements in low P50 suppressing SCZ patients and healthy participants with the α7 agonist, CDP-choline, this pilot study examined the combined modulatory effect of CDP-choline (500 mg) and galantamine (16 mg), a nAChR positive allosteric modulator and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on SG to speech stimuli in twenty-four SCZ patients in a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled design. As expected, in low P50 suppressors CDP-choline/galantamine (vs. Placebo) improved rP50 and dP50 scores by increasing inhibitory mechanisms as reflected by S2P50 amplitude reductions. Results also suggest a moderating role for auditory verbal hallucinations in treatment response. These preliminary findings provide supportive evidence for the involvement of α7 nAChR activity in speech gating in SCZ and support additional trials, examining different dose combinations and repeated doses of this optimized and personalized targeted α7 cholinergic treatment for SG dysfunction in subgroups of SCZ patients.

Effects of acute CDP-choline treatment on resting state brain oscillations in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2015.02.032	CDP-choline (cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine) is a phospholipid used to treat cognitive disorders, presumably repairing and maintaining brain cell membranes. Additional mechanisms may include enhanced cholinergic neurotransmission as the α7 nicotinic receptor actions of choline and increased acetylcholine synthesis accompanying CDP-choline administration may modulate brain oscillations underlying cognitive processes. This study utilizes electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in healthy volunteers to evaluate CDP-choline induction of an oscillatory response profile associated with nicotinic stimulation. Resting state EEG was acquired in 24 male volunteers administered low (500mg) and moderate (1000mg) doses of CDP-choline in a randomized placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Consistent with nicotinic agonist treatment, spectral analysis showed dose-dependent reductions in delta and increases in alpha oscillations, which were also accompanied by decreases in beta and gamma oscillatory activity. These findings support the posit that CDP-choline cognitive enhancement involves multiple mechanisms including facilitated nicotinic cholinergic action.

Improvements in concentration, working memory and sustained attention following consumption of a natural citicoline-caffeine beverage.	DOI: 10.3109/09637486.2014.940286	This study examined the neurocognitive and electrophysiological effects of a citicoline-caffeine-based beverage in 60 healthy adult participants enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Measures of electrical brain activity using electroencephalogram (EEG) and neuropsychological measures examining attention, concentration and reaction time were administered. Compared to placebo, participants receiving the citicoline-caffeine beverage exhibited significantly faster maze learning times and reaction times on a continuous performance test, fewer errors in a go/no-go task and better accuracy on a measure of information processing speed. EEG results examining P450 event-related potentials revealed that participants receiving the citicoline-caffeine beverage exhibited higher P450 amplitudes than controls, suggesting an increase in sustained attention. Overall, these findings suggest that the beverage significantly improved sustained attention, cognitive effort and reaction times in healthy adults. Evidence of improved P450 amplitude indicates a general improvement in the ability to accommodate new and relevant information within working memory and overall enhanced brain activation.

Improvements in quantitative EEG following consumption of a natural citicoline-enhanced beverage.	DOI: 10.3109/09637486.2011.632623	The present study examined the impact of a taurine-free drink enhanced with citicoline and other natural ingredients on electrophysiological markers of mental alertness. Ten healthy adult participants enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study and were randomized to receive either placebo or the citicoline supplement on the first visit. Measures of electrical brain activity using electroencephalogram (EEG) were collected 30 min after consuming the beverage. Seven days after the initial assessment participants completed the alternative condition (placebo or citicoline beverage). Compared to placebo, significant improvements were found in frontal alpha EEG and N100 event related potentials (ERP) associated with the citicoline-enhanced supplement. These preliminary findings suggest that a novel brain drink containing compounds known to increase choline in the brain significantly improved attention as measured by ERP and EEG. These findings suggest that a viable and alternative brain supplement without potential compounds such as taurine may augment attentional mechanisms in healthy individuals.

Kinetics and dynamics of intravenous adinazolam, N-desmethyl adinazolam, and alprazolam in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/0091270004269105	The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of adinazolam mesylate (10 mg), N-desmethyl adinazolam mesylate (NDMAD, 10 mg), and alprazolam (1 mg) were investigated in 9 healthy male subjects in a randomized, blinded, single-dose, 4-way crossover study. All drugs were intravenously infused over 30 minutes. Plasma adinazolam, NDMAD, and alprazolam concentrations, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the beta (12-30 Hz) range, performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and subjective measures of mood and sedation were monitored for 12 to 24 hours. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for adinazolam, NDMAD, and alprazolam, respectively, were as follows: volume of distribution (L), 106, 100, and 77; elimination half-life (hours), 2.9, 2.8, and 14.6; and clearance (mL/min), 444, 321, and 84. More than 80% of the total infused adinazolam dose was converted to systemically appearing NDMAD. All 3 benzodiazepine agonists significantly increased beta EEG activity, with alprazolam showing the strongest agonist activity and adinazolam showing the weakest activity. Alprazolam and NDMAD significantly decreased DSST performance, whereas adinazolam had no effect relative to placebo. Adinazolam, NDMAD, and alprazolam all produced significant observer-rated sedation. Plots of EEG effect versus plasma alprazolam concentration demonstrated counterclockwise hysteresis, consistent with an effect site delay. This was incorporated into a kinetic-dynamic model in which hypothetical effect site concentration was related to pharmacodynamic EEG effect via the sigmoid E(max) model, yielding an effect site equilibration half-life of 4.8 minutes. The exponential effect model described NDMAD pharmacokinetics and EEG pharmacodynamics. The relation of both alprazolam and NDMAD plasma concentrations to DSST performance could be described by a modified exponential model. Pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling was not possible for adinazolam, as the data did not conform to any known concentration-effect model. Collectively, these results indicate that the benzodiazepine-like effects occurring after adinazolam administration are mediated by mainly NDMAD.

Temporal gamma tACS and auditory stimulation affect verbal memory in healthy adults.	DOI: 10.1111/psyp.14653	Research suggests a potential of gamma oscillation entrainment for enhancing memory in Alzheimer's disease and healthy subjects. Gamma entrainment can be accomplished with oscillatory electrical, but also sensory stimulation. However, comparative studies between sensory stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) effects on memory processes are lacking. This study examined the effects of rhythmic gamma auditory stimulation (rAS) and temporal gamma-tACS on verbal long-term memory (LTM) and working memory (WM) in 74 healthy individuals. Participants were assigned to two groups according to the stimulation techniques (rAS or tACS). Memory was assessed in three experimental blocks, in which each participant was administered with control, 40, and 60 Hz stimulation in counterbalanced order. All interventions were well-tolerated, and participants reported mostly comparable side effects between real stimulation (40 and 60 Hz) and the control condition. LTM immediate and delayed recall remained unaffected by stimulations, while immediate recall intrusions decreased during 60 Hz stimulation. Notably, 40 Hz interventions improved WM compared to control stimulations. These results highlight the potential of 60 and 40 Hz temporal cortex stimulation for reducing immediate LTM recall intrusions and improving WM performance, respectively, probably due to the entrainment of specific gamma oscillations in the auditory cortex. The results also shed light on the comparative effects of these neuromodulation tools on memory functions, and their potential applications for cognitive enhancement and in clinical trials.

Structural templates for imaging EEG cortical sources in infants.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117682	Electroencephalographic (EEG) source reconstruction is a powerful approach that allows anatomical localization of electrophysiological brain activity. Algorithms used to estimate cortical sources require an anatomical model of the head and the brain, generally reconstructed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When such scans are unavailable, a population average can be used for adults, but no average surface template is available for cortical source imaging in infants. To address this issue, we introduce a new series of 13 anatomical models for subjects between zero and 24 months of age. These templates are built from MRI averages and boundary element method (BEM) segmentation of head tissues available as part of the Neurodevelopmental MRI Database. Surfaces separating the pia mater, the gray matter, and the white matter were estimated using the Infant FreeSurfer pipeline. The surface of the skin as well as the outer and inner skull surfaces were extracted using a cube marching algorithm followed by Laplacian smoothing and mesh decimation. We post-processed these meshes to correct topological errors and ensure watertight meshes. Source reconstruction with these templates is demonstrated and validated using 100 high-density EEG recordings from 7-month-old infants. Hopefully, these templates will support future studies on EEG-based neuroimaging and functional connectivity in healthy infants as well as in clinical pediatric populations.

Effects of antiepileptic drugs on cortical excitability in humans: A TMS-EMG and TMS-EEG study.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.24448	Brain responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) are emergent noninvasive markers of neuronal excitability and effective connectivity in humans. However, the underlying physiology of these TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) is still heavily underexplored, impeding a broad application of TEPs to study pathology in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we tested the effects of a single oral dose of three antiepileptic drugs with specific modes of action (carbamazepine, a voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blocker; brivaracetam, a ligand to the presynaptic vesicle protein VSA2; tiagabine, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake inhibitor) on TEP amplitudes in 15 healthy adults in a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled crossover design. We found that carbamazepine decreased the P25 and P180 TEP components, and brivaracetam the N100 amplitude in the nonstimulated hemisphere, while tiagabine had no effect. Findings corroborate the view that the P25 represents axonal excitability of the corticospinal system, the N100 in the nonstimulated hemisphere propagated activity suppressed by inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, and the P180 late activity particularly sensitive to VGSC blockade. Pharmaco-physiological characterization of TEPs will facilitate utilization of TMS-EEG in neuropsychiatric disorders with altered excitability and/or network connectivity.

Elevating endogenous GABA levels with GAT-1 blockade modulates evoked but not induced responses in human visual cortex.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2013.9	The electroencephalographic/magnetoencephalographic (EEG/MEG) signal is generated primarily by the summation of the postsynaptic currents of cortical principal cells. At a microcircuit level, these glutamatergic principal cells are reciprocally connected to GABAergic interneurons. Here we investigated the relative sensitivity of visual evoked and induced responses to altered levels of endogenous GABAergic inhibition. To do this, we pharmacologically manipulated the GABA system using tiagabine, which blocks the synaptic GABA transporter 1, and so increases endogenous GABA levels. In a single-blinded and placebo-controlled crossover study of 15 healthy participants, we administered either 15 mg of tiagabine or a placebo. We recorded whole-head MEG, while participants viewed a visual grating stimulus, before, 1, 3 and 5 h post tiagabine ingestion. Using beamformer source localization, we reconstructed responses from early visual cortices. Our results showed no change in either stimulus-induced gamma-band amplitude increases or stimulus-induced alpha amplitude decreases. However, the same data showed a 45% reduction in the evoked response component at ∼80 ms. These data demonstrate that, in early visual cortex the evoked response shows a greater sensitivity compared with induced oscillations to pharmacologically increased endogenous GABA levels. We suggest that previous studies correlating GABA concentrations as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy to gamma oscillation frequency may reflect underlying variations such as interneuron/inhibitory synapse density rather than functional synaptic GABA concentrations.

Tiagabine increases [11C]flumazenil binding in cortical brain regions in healthy control subjects.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2008.104	Accumulating evidence indicates that synchronization of cortical neuronal activity at gamma-band frequencies is important for various types of perceptual and cognitive processes and that GABA-A receptor-mediated transmission is required for the induction of these network oscillations. In turn, the abnormalities in GABA transmission postulated to play a role in psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia might contribute to the cognitive deficits seen in this illness. We measured the ability to increase GABA in eight healthy subjects by comparing the binding of [(11)C]flumazenil, a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer specific for the benzodiazepine (BDZ) site, at baseline and in the presence of an acute elevation in GABA levels through the blockade of the GABA membrane transporter (GAT1). Preclinical work suggests that increased GABA levels enhance the affinity of GABA-A receptors for BDZ ligands (termed 'GABA shift'). Theoretically, such an increase in the affinity of GABA-A receptors should be detected as an increase in the binding of a GABA-A BDZ-receptor site-specific PET radioligand. GAT1 blockade resulted in significant increases in mean (+/- SD) [(11)C]flumazenil-binding potential (BP(ND)) over baseline in brain regions representing the major functional domains of the cerebral cortex: association cortex +15.2+/-20.2% (p=0.05), sensory cortex +13.5+/-15.5% (p=0.03) and limbic (medial temporal lobe, MTL) +16.4+/-20.2% (p=0.03). The increase in [(11)C]flumazenil-BP(ND) was not accounted for by differences in the plasma-free fraction (f(P); paired t-test p=0.24) or changes in the nonspecific binding (pons V(T), p=0.73). Moreover, the ability to increase GABA strongly predicted (r=0.85, p=0.015) the ability to entrain cortical networks, measured through EEG gamma synchrony during a cognitive control task in these same subjects. Although additional studies are necessary to further validate this technique, these data provide preliminary evidence of the ability to measure in vivo, with PET, acute fluctuations in extracellular GABA levels and provide the first in vivo documentation of a relationship between GABA neurotransmission and EEG gamma-band power in humans.

To investigate the dependence of movement-related cortical oscillations on excitation-inhibition balance, we pharmacologically manipulated the GABA system using tiagabine, which blocks GABA Transporter 1(GAT-1), the GABA uptake transporter and increases endogenous GABA activity. In a blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design, in 15 healthy participants we administered either 15mg of tiagabine or a placebo. We recorded whole-head magnetoencephalograms, while the participants performed a movement task, prior to, one hour post, three hour post and five hour post tiagabine ingestion. Using time-frequency analysis of beamformer source reconstructions, we quantified the baseline level of beta activity (15-30Hz), the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR), beta event-related desynchronisation (beta-ERD) and movement-related gamma synchronisation (MRGS) (60-90Hz). Our results demonstrated that tiagabine, and hence elevated endogenous GABA levels causes, an elevation of baseline beta power, enhanced beta-ERD and reduced PMBR, but no modulation of MRGS. Comparing our results to recent literature (Hall et al., 2011) we suggest that beta-ERD may be a GABAA receptor mediated process while PMBR may be GABAB receptor mediated.

Matcha Does Not Affect Electroencephalography during Sleep but May Enhance Mental Well-Being: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.	DOI: 10.3390/nu16172907	Although theanine in matcha improves sleep quality and cognitive function, the caffeine in green tea is thought to worsen sleep quality. Therefore, this study investigated the factors behind the observed improvements in subjective sleep quality in matcha. A placebo-controlled randomized double-blind parallel-group study was conducted on healthy Japanese men and women aged 27-64 years. After 4 weeks of consuming 2.7 g of matcha daily (containing 50.3 mg theanine, 301.4 mg catechins, and 71.5 mg caffeine), no significant differences were observed between the control and matcha groups on total sleep time, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, or sleep efficiency measured by electroencephalography (EEG). However, the sleep questionnaire Oguri-Shirakawa-Azumi Sleep Inventory, the Middle-age and Aged version (OSA-MA), administered immediately after waking showed a trend toward increased satisfaction with sleep time (p < 0.1), and EEG measurements indicated significantly shortened wake-up times after waking with matcha intake (p < 0.05). The Beck Depression Inventory-II scores also tended to decrease (p < 0.1). The continuous intake of matcha may offer improved subjective sleep quality and emotional stability despite not offering significant changes in objective sleep parameters.

Characterization of the psychological, physiological and EEG profile of acute betel quid intoxication in naïve subjects.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0023874	Betel quid use and abuse is wide spread in Asia but the physiological basis of intoxication and addiction are unknown. In subjects naïve to the habit of betel quid intoxication, the psychological and physiological profile of intoxication has never been reported. We compared the effect of chewing gum or chewing betel quid, and subsequent betel quid intoxication, on psychological assessment, prospective time interval estimation, numerical and character digit span, computerized 2 choice tests and mental tasks such as reading and mathematics with concurrent monitoring of ECG, EEG and face temperature in healthy, non-sleep deprived, male subjects naïve to the habit of chewing betel quid. Betel quid intoxication, dose dependently induced tachycardia (max 30 bpm) and elevated face temperature (0.7°C) (P<0.001) above the effects observed in response to chewing gum (max 12 bpm and 0.3°C) in 12 subjects. Gross behavioral indices of working memory such as numerical or character digit span in 8 subjects, or simple visual-motor performance such as reaction speed or accuracy in a two choice scenario in 8 subjects were not affected by betel quid intoxication. Betel quid intoxication strongly influenced the psychological aspects of perception such as slowing of the prospective perception of passage of a 1 minute time interval in 8 subjects (P<0.05) and perceived increased arousal (P<0.01) and perceived decreased ability to think (P<0.05) in 31 subjects. The EEG spectral profile recorded from mental states associated with open and closed eyes, and mental tasks such as reading and eyes closed mental arithmetic were significantly modified (P<0.05) relative to chewing gum by betel quid intoxication in 10 subjects. The prevalence of betel quid consumption across a range of social and work settings warrants greater investigation of this widespread but largely under researched drug.

Dynamics of AMPA receptors regulate epileptogenesis in patients with epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrm.2023.101020	The excitatory glutamate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) contribute to epileptogenesis. Thirty patients with epilepsy and 31 healthy controls are scanned using positron emission tomography with our recently developed radiotracer for AMPARs, [11C]K-2, which measures the density of cell-surface AMPARs. In patients with focal-onset seizures, an increase in AMPAR trafficking augments the amplitude of abnormal gamma activity detected by electroencephalography. In contrast, patients with generalized-onset seizures exhibit a decrease in AMPARs coupled with increased amplitude of abnormal gamma activity. Patients with epilepsy had reduced AMPAR levels compared with healthy controls, and AMPARs are reduced in larger areas of the cortex in patients with generalized-onset seizures compared with those with focal-onset seizures. Thus, epileptic brain function can be regulated by the enhanced trafficking of AMPAR due to Hebbian plasticity with increased simultaneous neuronal firing and compensational downregulation of cell-surface AMPARs by the synaptic scaling.

The effects of D-Cycloserine on corticospinal excitability after repeated spaced intermittent theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation: A randomized controlled trial in healthy individuals.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-023-01575-7	Repeated spaced TMS protocols, also termed accelerated TMS protocols, are of increasing therapeutic interest. The long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effects of repeated spaced intermittent theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS) are presumed to be N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) dependent; however, this has not been tested. We tested whether the LTP-like effects of repeated spaced iTBS are influenced by low-dose D-Cycloserine (100 mg), an NMDA-R partial-agonist. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 20 healthy adults from August 2021-Feb 2022. Participants received repeated spaced iTBS, consisting of two iTBS sessions 60 minutes apart, to the primary motor cortex. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the motor evoked potentials (MEP) at 120% resting motor threshold (RMT) was measured after each iTBS. The TMS stimulus-response (TMS-SR; 100-150% RMT) was measured at baseline, +30 min, and +60 min after each iTBS. We found evidence for a significant Drug*iTBS effect in MEP amplitude, revealing that D-Cycloserine enhanced MEP amplitudes relative to the placebo. When examining TMS-SR, pairing iTBS with D-Cycloserine increased the TMS-SR slope relative to placebo after both iTBS tetani, and this was due to an increase in the upper bound of the TMS-SR. This indicates that LTP-like and metaplastic effects of repeated-spaced iTBS involve NMDA-R, as revealed by two measures of corticospinal excitability, and that low-dose D-Cycloserine facilitates the physiological effects of repeated spaced iTBS. However, extension of these findings to clinical populations and therapeutic protocols targeting non-motor regions of cortex requires empirical validation.

Overnight memory consolidation facilitates rather than interferes with new learning of similar materials-a study probing NMDA receptors.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-018-0139-0	Although sleep-dependent consolidation and its neurochemical underpinnings have been strongly researched, less is known about how consolidation during sleep affects subsequent learning. Since sleep enhances memory, it can be expected to pro-actively interfere with learning after sleep, in particular of similar materials. This pro-active interference should be enhanced by substances that benefit consolidation during sleep, such as D-cycloserine. We tested this hypothesis in two groups (Sleep, Wake) of young healthy participants receiving on one occasion D-cycloserine (175 mg) and on another occasion placebo, according to a double-blind balanced crossover design. Treatment was administered after participants had learned a set of word pairs (A-B list) and before nocturnal retention periods of sleep vs. wakefulness. After D-cycloserine blood plasma levels had dropped to negligible amounts, i.e., the next day in the evening, participants learned, in three sequential runs, new sets of word pairs. One list-to enhance interference-consisted of the same cue words as the original set paired with a new target word (A-C list) and the other of completely new cue words (D-E set). Unexpectedly, during post-retention learning the A-C interference list was generally better learned than the completely new D-E list, which suggests that consolidation of previously encoded similar material enhances memory integration rather than pro-active interference. Consistent with this view, new learning of word pairs was better after sleep than wakefulness. Similarly, D-cycloserine generally enhanced learning of new word pairs, compared to placebo. This effect being independent of sleep or wakefulness, leads us to speculate that D-cycloserine, in addition to enhancing sleep-dependent consolidation, might mediate a time-dependent process of active forgetting.

Effects of Augmenting N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Signaling on Working Memory and Experience-Dependent Plasticity in Schizophrenia: An Exploratory Study Using Acute d-cycloserine.	DOI: 10.1093/schbul/sbw193	Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have been hypothesized to reflect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction. However, the mechanisms through which the NMDAR contributes to individual cognitive functions differ. To explore how NMDAR signaling relates to specific cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, we tested the effects of enhancing NMDAR signaling on working memory and experience-dependent plasticity using d-cycloserine (DCS). Plasticity was assessed using an EEG paradigm that utilizes high-frequency visual stimulation (HFvS) to induce neural potentiation, and 2 learning tasks, the information integration (IIT) and weather prediction (WPT) tasks. Working memory was assessed using an N-back task. Forty-five schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive a single 100 mg DCS dose (SZ-DCS; n = 24) or placebo (SZ-PLC; n = 21) in a double-blind, between-groups design. Testing occurred on a single day after placebo or DCS administration; baseline values were not obtained. DCS did not affect plasticity, as indicated by similar neural potentiation, and similar IIT and WPT learning between groups. However, among patients who successfully engaged in the working memory task (ie, performed above chance), SZ-DCS (n = 17) showed superior 2-back performance compared to SZ-PLC (n = 16). Interestingly, SZ-DCS also showed larger pre-HFvS neural responses during the LTP task. Notably, this pattern of DCS effects is the opposite of those found in our prior study of healthy adults. Results are consistent with target engagement of the NMDAR by DCS, but suggest that NMDAR signaling was not translated into synaptic plasticity changes in schizophrenia. Results highlight the importance of considering how distinct NMDAR-associated processes contribute to individual cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

The effects of AMPA blockade on the spectral profile of human early visual cortex recordings studied with non-invasive MEG.	DOI: 10.1016/j.cortex.2016.03.004	The generation of gamma-band (>30 Hz) cortical activity is thought to depend on the reciprocal connections of excitatory glutamatergic principal cells with inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. Both in vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that blockade of glutamatergic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors reduces the amplitude of gamma-band activity. In this registered report, we hypothesised that similar effects would be observed in humans following administration of perampanel, a first in class AMPA antagonist, used in the treatment of epilepsy. In a single-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, 20 healthy male participants completed two study days. On one day participants were given a 6 mg dose of perampanel and on the other an inactive placebo. magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of brain activity were taken before and two hours after drug administration, with activity in the visual cortex probed using a stimulation protocol known to induce gamma-band activity in the primary visual cortex. As hypothesised, our results indicated a decrease in gamma-band amplitudes following perampanel administration. The decreases in gamma-band amplitudes observed were temporally restricted to the early time-period of stimulus presentation (up to 400 msec) with no significant effects observed on early evoked responses or alpha rhythms. This suggests that the early time-window of induced visual gamma-band activity, thought to reflect input to the visual cortex from the lateral geniculate nucleus, is most sensitive to AMPA blocking drugs.

Augmenting NMDA receptor signaling boosts experience-dependent neuroplasticity in the adult human brain.	DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1509262112	Experience-dependent plasticity is a fundamental property of the brain. It is critical for everyday function, is impaired in a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and frequently depends on long-term potentiation (LTP). Preclinical studies suggest that augmenting N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) signaling may promote experience-dependent plasticity; however, a lack of noninvasive methods has limited our ability to test this idea in humans until recently. We examined the effects of enhancing NMDAR signaling using d-cycloserine (DCS) on a recently developed LTP EEG paradigm that uses high-frequency visual stimulation (HFvS) to induce neural potentiation in visual cortex neurons, as well as on three cognitive tasks: a weather prediction task (WPT), an information integration task (IIT), and a n-back task. The WPT and IIT are learning tasks that require practice with feedback to reach optimal performance. The n-back assesses working memory. Healthy adults were randomized to receive DCS (100 mg; n = 32) or placebo (n = 33); groups were similar in IQ and demographic characteristics. Participants who received DCS showed enhanced potentiation of neural responses following repetitive HFvS, as well as enhanced performance on the WPT and IIT. Groups did not differ on the n-back. Augmenting NMDAR signaling using DCS therefore enhanced activity-dependent plasticity in human adults, as demonstrated by lasting enhancement of neural potentiation following repetitive HFvS and accelerated acquisition of two learning tasks. Results highlight the utility of considering cellular mechanisms underlying distinct cognitive functions when investigating potential cognitive enhancers.

Acute sleep deprivation: the effects of the AMPAKINE compound CX717 on human cognitive performance, alertness and recovery sleep.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881111405353	AMPA receptor modulation is a potential novel approach to enhance cognitive performance. CX717 is a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor that has shown efficacy in rodent and primate cognition models. CX717 (100 mg, 300 mg and 1000 mg) and placebo were studied in 16 healthy male volunteers (18-45 years) in a randomized, crossover study. Cognitive function, arousal and recovery sleep (by polysomnography) were assessed during the extended wakefulness protocol. Placebo condition was associated with significant decrements in cognition, particularly at the circadian nadir (between 03:00 and 05:00). Pre-specified primary and secondary analyses (general linear mixed modelling, GLMM) at each separate time point did not reveal consistent improvements in performance or objective alertness with any dose of CX717. Exploratory repeated measures analysis, a method used to take into account the influence of individual differences, demonstrated an improvement in attention-based task performance following the 1000 mg dose. Analysis of the recovery sleep showed that CX717 1000 mg significantly reduced stage 4 and slow-wave sleep (p ≤ 0.05) with evidence of reduced electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave and spindle activity. The study suggests that CX717 only at the 1000 mg dose may counteract effects of sleep deprivation on attention-based tasks and that it may interfere with subsequent recovery sleep.

Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was computed from the spectrally analyzed EEG data, and differences between drug and placebo were displayed as statistical parametric maps. Data were registered to the Talairach-Tournoux Human Brain Atlas available as a digitized MRI. An overall omnibus significance test followed by a voxel-by-voxel t test demonstrated significant regional EEG changes after ABIO-08/01 versus placebo, dependent on recording condition, dose and time. While in the EO-EEG specifically the lowest dose of ABIO-08/01 induced pronounced sedative effects (delta/theta and beta increase) 1 h after acute and slightly less so after superimposed administration, in the 6th hour a decrease in alpha and beta activity signaled less sedative and more relaxant action. In the V-EEG these changes were less pronounced, in the R-EEG partly opposite. Hemisphere-specific changes were observed, suggesting increases in LORETA power over the left temporal, parietal, superior frontal regions and decreases over the right prefrontal, temporal pole and occipital regions. These LORETA changes are discussed in the light of neuroimaging findings on anxiety and anxiolytics.

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending-dose study on the pharmacodynamics of ABIO-08/01, a new CNS drug with potential anxiolytic activity. 1. EEG mapping, psychometric and tolerability findings.	DOI: 10.1159/000212379	In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending-dose study, the encephalotropic and psychotropic properties of ABIO-08/01, a new potentially anxiolytic and nootropic isoxazoline, were studied in 16 young healthy males. In a randomized nonbalanced phase 1 study, they received 3 oral drug doses (10, 20, 40 mg) and placebo for 7 days (washout period 8 days). EEG mapping and psychometry were carried out at hours 0, 1, 6 of day 1 (acute effect) and day 5 (subacute and superimposed effects). MANOVA/ Hotelling T(2) test demonstrated significant central effects of ABIO-08/01 versus placebo after acute, subacute and superimposed administration of all doses in the resting, vigilance-controlled and eyes-open EEG. Univariate analysis revealed activating patterns in the resting EEG (40 mg > 20 mg > 10 mg), and sedative patterns in the eyes-open EEG (10 mg > 20 mg > 40 mg). In the vigilance-controlled EEG, 40 mg of ABIO-08/01 induced activating patterns, whereas 10 mg induced sedative patterns. Concerning psychometry, ABIO-08/01 improved concentration (40 mg > 20 mg > 10 mg; activating effect) and deteriorated well-being (10 mg > 20 mg > 40 mg; sedative effect). Ten milligrams also improved reaction time performance and psychomotor activity. ABIO-08/01 is well-tolerated and is of interest in anxiety disorders.

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending-dose study on the effects of ABIO-08/01, a novel anxiolytic drug, on perception and cognition, utilizing event-related potential mapping and low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography.	DOI: 10.1002/hup.920	Early pharmacological studies in animals demonstrated that ABIO-08/01, a new isoxazoline, exerted anxiolytic and anticonvulsant, but also cognition-enhancing properties. Thus, the aim of the present double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-ascending-dose study was to investigate the effect of the new compound on event-related potentials (ERPs). In a randomized ascending-dose design for phase-1 studies, 16 young healthy male subjects aged 30.2 +/- 5.7 years received three ascending drug doses (10, 20, and 40 mg) and placebo for 7 days, with a washout period of 8 days in between. Auditory ERPs were recorded pre-dose and 2 h post-dose on days 1 (acute effect) and 5 (subacute and absolute superimposed effect). Descriptive statistics with one confirmatory statement on P300 latency demonstrated a significant shortening after acute, subacute, and superimposed administration of 40 mg ABIO-08/01. While ERP amplitudes showed only minor effects, low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) demonstrated that ABIO-08/01 promotes more efficient information processing by reallocating perceptual and cognitive ERP resources. Thus, our ERP studies confirm early pharmacological findings in animals of a cognition-enhancing effect of ABIO-08/01, which is interesting in the context of the anxiolytic mode of action of the compound as its CNS effects are quite different from those of anxiolytic sedatives, such as benzodiazepines.

The influence of parecoxib, a parenteral cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of midazolam.	DOI: 10.1097/00000539-200209000-00032	Parecoxib, a parenteral cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, is undergoing clinical development as an analgesic/antiinflammatory drug for perioperative use. Parecoxib, an inactive prodrug, is hydrolyzed in vivo to valdecoxib, a substrate for hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Thus, potential exists for interactions with other CYP3A4 substrates. In this investigation, we determined the influence of parecoxib on the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, in volunteers. This was a randomized, balanced crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical investigation. Twelve healthy subjects aged 23-41 yr were studied after providing IRB-approved informed consent. Midazolam 0.07 mg/kg IV infusion was administered 1 h after placebo (control) or parecoxib 40 mg IV. Venous midazolam concentrations were determined by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic variables were determined by noncompartmental analysis. Pharmacodynamic measurements included clinical end-points, cognitive function (memory; digit symbol substitution tests), subjective self-assessment of recovery (visual analog scales), and bispectral index. Midazolam plasma concentrations were similar between placebo and parecoxib-treated subjects. No differences were found in midazolam pharmacokinetics (maximal observed plasma concentration, clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution) or pharmacodynamics (clinical end-points, digit symbol substitution tests, memory, visual analog scales, bispectral index). Single-bolus parecoxib does not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of midazolam infusion. Parecoxib did not affect CYP3A4 activity as assessed using midazolam clearance as the in vivo probe.

Preclinical and phase 1 clinical characterization of CI-979/RU35926, a novel muscarinic agonist for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	DOI: 10.1016/0024-3205(95)00023-y	In vitro and in vivo characterization in rodents and monkeys shows that CI-979/RU35926 is a partial muscarinic agonist with equal affinity for the five subtypes of muscarinic receptors. It activates central cholinergic receptors as shown by its ability to decrease body temperature, enhance local cortical blood flow and increase cortical arousal measured by QEEG. Further, it reverses spatial memory deficits in rats with ibotenic acid-induced lesions of forebrain cholinergic neurons. Signs of peripheral cholinergic stimulation appear at doses higher or equal to those necessary to produce central activity. In a single-dose tolerance study in young, healthy human volunteers, CI-979/RU35926 was well tolerated at doses of 0.002-1.0 mg with cholinergic symptoms such as hypersalivation and sweating, observed at 2-4 mg. It demonstrated linear pharmacokinetic behavior over a dose range of 0.1 to 4 mg and elimination half-life varied from 2-5 hours. Measurement of unchanged drug in urine suggests that the drug was extensively metabolized. Thus, the safety profile supported further clinical evaluation and CI-979/RU35926 is currently in Phase II clinical trials.

A Computerized Test Battery to Study Pharmacodynamic Effects on the Central Nervous System of Cholinergic Drugs in Early Phase Drug Development.	DOI: 10.3791/56569	Investigating potential pharmacodynamic effects in an early phase of central nervous system (CNS) drug research can provide valuable information for further development of new compounds. A computerized and thoroughly validated battery of neuropsychological and neurophysiological tests has been shown to be sensitive to detect drug-induced effects of multiple new and existing compounds. The test battery covers the main CNS domains, which have been shown to respond to drug effects and can be repeatedly administered following drug administration to characterize the concentration-effect profile of a drug. The standard tests in the battery are saccadic eye movement, smooth pursuit eye movement, the Bowdle visual analog scale (VAS), the Bond and Lader VAS, body sway, adaptive tracking, visual verbal learning, and quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). However, the test battery is adaptive in nature, meaning that it can be composed and adjusted with tests fit to investigate specific drug classes, or even specific receptors. Showing effects of new cholinergic drugs designed to have a pro-cognitive outcome has been difficult. The pharmacological challenge model is a tool for early proof-of-pharmacology. Here, a marketed drug is used to induce temporary and reversible disease-like symptoms in healthy subjects, via a pharmacological mechanism related to the disease that is targeted as indication for the new compound. The test battery was implemented to investigate the potential of the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine to be used as a challenge model for cholinergic dysfunction, as seen in neurodegenerative disorders. A worsening of scores in a dose dependent manner on the visual verbal learning test (VVLT; a test for learning and memory abilities) and the adaptive tracking test (a measure of visuomotor control and arousal), in particular, showed that the test battery is sensitive to showing acute pharmacodynamic effect after administration of anti-cholinergic drugs.

Impaired off-line consolidation of motor memories after combined blockade of cholinergic receptors during REM sleep-rich sleep.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2009.6	Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep has been considered important for the consolidation of memories, particularly of procedural skills. REM sleep, in contrast to slow-wave sleep (SWS), is hallmarked by the high, wake-like activity of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), which promotes certain synaptic plastic processes underlying the formation of memories. Here, we show in healthy young men that off-line consolidation of a motor skill during a period of late sleep with high amounts of REM sleep depends essentially on high cholinergic activity. After a 3-h sleep period during the early night to satisfy the need for SWS, subjects learned a procedural finger sequence tapping task and a declarative word-pair learning task. After learning, they received either placebo or a combination of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (4 microg/kg bodyweight, intravenously) and the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (5 mg, orally), and then slept for another 3 h, ie, the late nocturnal sleep period, which is dominated by REM sleep. Retrieval was tested the following evening. Combined cholinergic receptor blockade significantly impaired motor skill consolidation, whereas word-pair memory remained unaffected. Additional data show that the impairing effect of cholinergic receptor blockade is specific to sleep-dependent consolidation of motor skill and does not occur during a wake-retention interval. Taken together, these results identify high cholinergic activity during late, REM sleep-rich sleep as an essential factor promoting sleep-dependent consolidation of motor skills.

Do we activate specifically somatosensory thin fibres with the concentric planar electrode? A scalp and intracranial EEG study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pain.2012.03.004	Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) are acknowledged as the most reliable laboratory tool for assessing thermal and pain pathways. Electrical stimulation with a newly developed planar concentric electrode, delivering stimuli limited to the superficial skin layers, has been suggested to provide selective activation of Aδ fibres without the inconveniences linked to laser stimulation. The aim of our study was to compare the scalp and intracranial responses to planar concentric electrode stimulation (CE-SEPs) with those of LEPs and standard somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs). Sixteen healthy subjects, 6 patients with intracortical electrodes, and 2 patients with selective lesions of the spinothalamic pathway were submitted to Neodymium:Yttrium-Aluminium-Perovskite laser stimulations, and electrical stimulations using standard electrodes or planar concentric electrodes (CE). In both healthy controls and epileptic implanted patients, CE- and standard SEPs showed significantly shorter latencies than LEPs. This is consistent with Aβ-fibre activation, peripheral activation time being unable to account for longer LEP latencies. In the patients with spinothalamic lesions, LEPs were absent after stimulation of the affected territory, while CE-SEPs were still present. For these 2 reasons, we conclude that the planar CE does not selectively activate the Aδ and C fibers, but coexcites a significant proportion of large myelinated Aβ fibres that dominate the ensuing cortical response. The use of CE-SEPs for the detection of spinothalamic system lesions is therefore not warranted; the planar electrode can, however, represent a useful tool to study nociceptive reflexes, which can be reliably elicited even in the presence of Aβ coactivation.

Potential changes with gamma-band oscillation at the frontal scalp elicited by intravenous olfactory stimulation in humans.	DOI: 10.1093/chemse/27.8.711	Intravenous olfaction is a unique stimulation method often used in Japan to diagnose olfactory disturbances. Odorant is injected into a vein and transported by blood flow and respiration to the upper air tract. The intravenous olfaction might allow the potential at the frontal scalp to be recorded without contamination from electromyograms, such as those caused by sniffing. We injected Alinamin (thiamine propyldisulphide) into healthy subjects according to a standard protocol for clinical intravenous olfaction testing and we simultaneously recorded potential changes at the frontal scalp. When Alinamin was injected into the right median cubital vein over a 20 s period, the potential changes with gamma-band oscillations were detected 17.6 +/- 6.7 s (mean +/- SD) after the start of the injection. The main frequency component of this gamma-band oscillation is 30-160 Hz. The gamma-band oscillation elicited by intravenous olfactory stimulation (VOP) was similar to the induced wave of the olfactory bulb. Mapping the VOPs on the frontal scalp of a subject with less developed frontal sinuses and the relation between the thickness of the frontal sinuses and VOP amplitude suggest an intracranial source, possibly the olfactory bulb. The gamma-band potential at the frontal scalp is a useful measure of central disturbance.

Benzodiazepine effects on human sleep EEG spectra: a comparison of triazolam and flunitrazepam.	DOI: 10.1016/s0024-3205(98)00318-x	The effects of 0.5 mg triazolam (TRI) and 4 mg flunitrazepam (FNZ) on the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) were studied in eleven (six for TRI, and five for FNZ) healthy young male subjects. C3 EEG channel data of one baseline night, three drug nights and two withdrawal nights were recorded and their analyzed using a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) method. Changes in the 0.5 Hz to 40 Hz power spectrum showed that: 1) both TRI and FNZ increased higher frequency activity and reduced lower frequency activity on the drug nights; 2) on drug nights, NREM sigma frequency power was more strongly enhanced by TRI than FNZ, while the beta power of both NREM and REM was more strongly enhanced by FNZ than TRI; 3) NREM alpha power increased on the second night of withdrawal from both TRI and FNZ; 4) the power spectra for both NREM and REM sleep returned to baseline levels by the fourth night of withdrawal from either TRI or FNZ. These findings suggest that 0.5 mg TRI and 4 mg FNZ have both common and differing pharmacological effects on the central nervous system. Such differences could be caused by differences in the dose, half-life or systemic distribution of these two drugs.

In A-shift with placebo, TST, SEI, %SR and REM/NREM decreased. ZP, FN and TZ shortened SL. All drugs increased TST and SEI. TZ and LP increased %SR and REM/NREM. 3. In D-shift with placebo, TST decreased, SWSL was prolonged, %S3+4 decreased, and %SR and REM/NREM increased. All drugs increased TST. ZP and LP shortened SWSL. All drugs increased %SWS. ZP, FN and TZ decreased %SR. ZP and FN decreased REM/NREM. 4. Daytime mental and physical conditions were worse than usual on more than half of the days in A- and D-shift. LP and FN caused some inadequate conditions on the following days.

Flunitrazepam effects on human sleep EEG spectra: Differences in NREM, REM and individual responses.	DOI: 10.1016/0024-3205(96)00026-4	Flunitrazepam (FNZ) (4mg), an intermediate type benzodiazepine (BDZ) hypnotic, was administered orally to five healthy male subjects (Ss) for seven consecutive nights. Sleep EEG from the baseline night (BLN), the initial drug night (IDN), the fourth and the seventh drug nights (4DN, 7DN) was subjected to fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis. During NREM sleep of 4DN and 7DN the sigma band (11.0-12.5 Hz) activity was similarly enhanced in every S. In REM of 4DN and 7DN beta band (23.0-29.0 Hz) was enhanced, but with larger variations among Ss. High intra-individual consistency of the relative EEG power patterns on 4DN and 7DN was observed. These results suggest that 1) EEG responses to FNZ are different in sleep states; explorations of these differences may provide better understandings of sleep mechanisms, and 2) individual variations in EEG responses may reflect individual variations of the BDZ receptor system. These methods may be useful for exploring receptor changes in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Ultradian dynamics of sleep after a single dose of benzodiazepine hypnotics.	DOI: 10.1016/0014-2999(91)90376-2	A single bedtime dose of the benzodiazepine hypnotics, flunitrazepam (2 mg), triazolam (0.5 mg) or flurazepam (30 mg), was administered to young, healthy subjects. Abortive first rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) episodes, characterized by a low level of EEG slow-wave activity (spectral power density in the 0.75-4.5 Hz band) without rapid eye movements and/or muscle atonia, were more frequent in the drug night than in the placebo night or in the drug-free night following upon the drug night. The benzodiazepine hypnotics depressed slow-wave activity in non-REM sleep (NREMS) in the drug night and the subsequent drug-free night. However, the typical declining trend of slow-wave activity over the first three NREMS-REMS cycles, and the cyclic ultradian pattern of slow-wave activity were little affected by the hypnotics. The results indicate that benzodiazepine hypnotics depress the generation of slow EEG waves without disrupting the homeostatic and ultradian processes of sleep regulation.

Long-, intermediate- and short-acting benzodiazepine effects on human sleep EEG spectra.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1440-1819.2003.01085.x	The effects of 10 mg haloxazolam (HAX), 4 mg flunitrazepam (FNZ), and 0.5 mg triazolam (TRI), each administered for seven consecutive nights were studied in the sleep electroencephalograms (EEG) of 17 (six HAX, five FNZ and six TRI) healthy male student volunteers. Recordings of C3-A1 EEG data from one baseline night, three drug nights (first, fourth and seventh) and two withdrawal nights (second and fourth) were analyzed using a fast Fourier transformation method. All three drugs induced similar changes in the 0.5 Hz to 40 Hz power spectrum; namely (i) higher frequency (including the sigma and beta bands) activity increased and lower frequency activity reduced on the drug nights; (ii) the enhancement of sigma activity peaked during non-rapid eye movement sleep following the first administration and was maintained at high levels on all drug nights; (iii) beta activity increased through the night after administration of HAX and FNZ, but not TRI, which suggests a blood concentration level dependent increase of beta activity; and (iv) only HAX showed a residual effect on the fourth withdrawal night. These results indicate that (i) chronic administration of these three benzodiazepine derivatives produce similar profiles in sleep EEG spectral changes, with some differences depending on their half-lives and doses; (ii) the mechanism of sigma enhancement is sensitive to even the initial administration night of BDZ; and (iii) frequencies below and above the sigma band are less sensitive to BDZ and also show an increase through the night after administration, suggesting differences in the mechanisms reflected by these EEG frequency bands.

Flunitrazepam effects on human sleep EEG spectra. II: Sigma and beta alterations during NREM sleep.	DOI: 10.1016/0024-3205(96)00367-0	Flunitrazepam (FNZ) is known to enhance the higher EEG frequencies, including sigma (10-15 Hz) and beta (20-28 Hz). Both sigma and beta frequency bands show an inverse relationship with delta (0.3-3 Hz) during NREM periods, as we have previously reported. It is not known whether generation of these two EEG frequencies is mediated by the same or different neuronal mechanisms. In this report, we compare alterations of delta, sigma and beta EEG induced by FNZ (4 mg) orally administered to five healthy male subjects for seven consecutive nights. Sleep EEG on the baseline night (BLN), and the fourth and seventh drug nights (4DN, 7DN) was subjected to fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis. On drug nights, sigma was enhanced without regard to delta amount, but beta was enhanced only during epochs containing low delta. Thus, sigma and beta EEG were altered differently by the same pharmacological agent. These results suggest that sigma and beta EEG are mediated by different neuronal mechanisms.

Electrophysiological Characteristics of Inhibitive Control for Adults with Different Physiological or Psychological Obesity.	DOI: 10.3390/nu16091252	Individuals exhibiting high scores on the fatness subscale of the negative-physical-self scale (NPSS-F) are characterized by heightened preoccupation with body fat accompanied by negative body image perceptions, often leading to excessive dieting behaviors. This demographic constitutes a considerable segment of the populace in China, even among those who are not obese. Nonetheless, scant empirical inquiries have delved into the behavioral and neurophysiological profiles of individuals possessing a healthy body mass index (BMI) alongside elevated NPSS-F scores. This study employed an experimental paradigm integrating go/no-go and one-back tasks to assess inhibitory control and working memory capacities concerning food-related stimuli across three adult cohorts: those with normal weight and low NPSS-F scores, those with normal weight and high NPSS-F scores, and individuals classified as obese. Experimental stimuli comprised high- and low-caloric-food pictures with concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) recordings. Individuals characterized by high NPSS-F scores and normal weight exhibited distinctive electrophysiological responses compared to the other two cohorts, evident in event-related potential (ERP) components, theta and alpha band oscillations, and heart rate variability (HRV) patterns. In essence, the findings underscore alterations in electrophysiological reactivity among individuals possessing high NPSS-F scores and a healthy BMI in the context of food-related stimuli, underscoring the necessity for increased attention to this demographic alongside individuals affected by obesity.

The utility of wearable headband electroencephalography and pulse photoplethysmography to assess cortical and physiological arousal in individuals with stress-related mental disorders.	DOI: 10.1111/jsr.14123	Several stress-related mental disorders are characterised by disturbed sleep, but objective sleep biomarkers are not routinely examined in psychiatric patients. We examined the use of wearable-based sleep biomarkers in a psychiatric sample with headband electroencephalography (EEG) including pulse photoplethysmography (PPG), with an additional focus on microstructural elements as especially the shift from low to high frequencies appears relevant for several stress-related mental disorders. We analysed 371 nights of sufficient quality from 83 healthy participants and those with a confirmed stress-related mental disorder (anxiety-affective spectrum). The median value of macrostructural, microstructural (spectral slope fitting), and heart rate variables was calculated across nights and analysed at the individual level (N = 83). The headbands were accepted well by patients and the data quality was sufficient for most nights. The macrostructural analyses revealed trends for significance regarding sleep continuity but not sleep depth variables. The spectral analyses yielded no between-group differences except for a group × age interaction, with the normal age-related decline in the low versus high frequency power ratio flattening in the patient group. The PPG analyses showed that the mean heart rate was higher in the patient group in pre-sleep epochs, a difference that reduced during sleep and dissipated at wakefulness. Wearable devices that record EEG and/or PPG could be used over multiple nights to assess sleep fragmentation, spectral balance, and sympathetic drive throughout the sleep-wake cycle in patients with stress-related mental disorders and healthy controls, although macrostructural and spectral markers did not differ between the two groups.

Signal quality and patient experience with wearable devices for epilepsy management.	DOI: 10.1111/epi.16527	Noninvasive wearable devices have great potential to aid the management of epilepsy, but these devices must have robust signal quality, and patients must be willing to wear them for long periods of time. Automated machine learning classification of wearable biosensor signals requires quantitative measures of signal quality to automatically reject poor-quality or corrupt data segments. In this study, commercially available wearable sensors were placed on patients with epilepsy undergoing in-hospital or in-home electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, and healthy volunteers. Empatica E4 and Biovotion Everion were used to record accelerometry (ACC), photoplethysmography (PPG), and electrodermal activity (EDA). Byteflies Sensor Dots were used to record ACC and PPG, the Activinsights GENEActiv watch to record ACC, and Epitel Epilog to record EEG data. PPG and EDA signals were recorded for multiple days, then epochs of high-quality, marginal-quality, or poor-quality data were visually identified by reviewers, and reviewer annotations were compared to automated signal quality measures. For ACC, the ratio of spectral power from 0.8 to 5 Hz to broadband power was used to separate good-quality signals from noise. For EDA, the rate of amplitude change and prevalence of sharp peaks significantly differentiated between good-quality data and noise. Spectral entropy was used to assess PPG and showed significant differences between good-, marginal-, and poor-quality signals. EEG data were evaluated using methods to identify a spectral noise cutoff frequency. Patients were asked to rate the usability and comfort of each device in several categories. Patients showed a significant preference for the wrist-worn devices, and the Empatica E4 device was preferred most often. Current wearable devices can provide high-quality data and are acceptable for routine use, but continued development is needed to improve data quality, consistency, and management, as well as acceptability to patients.

Reconstruction of gastric slow wave from finger photoplethysmographic signal using radial basis function neural network.	DOI: 10.1007/s11517-011-0796-1	Extraction of extra-cardiac information from photoplethysmography (PPG) signal is a challenging research problem with significant clinical applications. In this study, radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used to reconstruct the gastric myoelectric activity (GMA) slow wave from finger PPG signal. Finger PPG and GMA (measured using Electrogastrogram, EGG) signals were acquired simultaneously at the sampling rate of 100 Hz from ten healthy subjects. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was used to extract slow wave (0-0.1953 Hz) component from the finger PPG signal; this slow wave PPG was used to reconstruct EGG. A RBFNN is trained on signals obtained from six subjects in both fasting and postprandial conditions. The trained network is tested on data obtained from the remaining four subjects. In the earlier study, we have shown the presence of GMA information in finger PPG signal using DWT and cross-correlation method. In this study, we explicitly reconstruct gastric slow wave from finger PPG signal by the proposed RBFNN-based method. It was found that the network-reconstructed slow wave provided significantly higher (P < 0.0001) correlation (≥ 0.9) with the subject's EGG slow wave than the correlation obtained (≈0.7) between the PPG slow wave from DWT and the EEG slow wave. Our results showed that a simple finger PPG signal can be used to reconstruct gastric slow wave using RBFNN method.

Correction for pulse height variability reduces physiological noise in functional MRI when studying spontaneous brain activity.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.20866	EEG correlated functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) allows the delineation of the areas corresponding to spontaneous brain activity, such as epileptiform spikes or alpha rhythm. A major problem of fMRI analysis in general is that spurious correlations may occur because fMRI signals are not only correlated with the phenomena of interest, but also with physiological processes, like cardiac and respiratory functions. The aim of this study was to reduce the number of falsely detected activated areas by taking the variation in physiological functioning into account in the general linear model (GLM). We used the photoplethysmogram (PPG), since this signal is based on a linear combination of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin in the arterial blood, which is also the basis of fMRI. We derived a regressor from the variation in pulse height (VIPH) of PPG and added this regressor to the GLM. When this regressor was used as predictor it appeared that VIPH explained a large part of the variance of fMRI signals acquired from five epilepsy patients and thirteen healthy volunteers. As a confounder VIPH reduced the number of activated voxels by 30% for the healthy volunteers, when studying the generators of the alpha rhythm. Although for the patients the number of activated voxels either decreased or increased, the identification of the epileptogenic zone was substantially enhanced in one out of five patients, whereas for the other patients the effects were smaller. In conclusion, applying VIPH as a confounder diminishes physiological noise and allows a more reliable interpretation of fMRI results.

To establish the causal link between leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibody and seizures, we developed an in-vivo antibody-mediated AE rat model in which serum antibodies (IgG) obtained from blood samples of leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) protein antibody (IgG) positive encephalitis patients were passively transferred into non-epileptic Wistar rats. Serum IgG of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibody positive patients were used as positive control since the pathogenicity of this antibody has been previously shown in animal models.

Neurophysiologic effect of GWAS derived schizophrenia and bipolar risk variants.	DOI: 10.1002/ajmg.b.32212	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as disease associated variants for schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BPD), or both. Although these results are statistically robust, the functional effects of these variants and their role in the pathophysiology of SCZ or BPD remain unclear. Dissecting the effects of risk genes on distinct domains of brain function can provide important biological insights into the mechanisms by which these genes may confer illness risk. This study used quantitative event related potentials to characterize the neurophysiological effects of well-documented GWAS-derived SCZ/BPD susceptibility variants in order to map gene effects onto important domains of brain function. We genotyped 199 patients with DSM-IV diagnoses of SCZ or BPD and 74 healthy control subjects for 19 risk SNPs derived from previous GWAS findings and tested their association with five neurophysiologic traits (P3 amplitude, P3 latency, N1 amplitude, P2 amplitude, and P50 sensory gating responses) known to be abnormal in psychosis. The TCF4 SNP rs17512836 risk allele showed a significant association with reduced auditory P3 amplitude (P = 0.00016) after correction for multiple testing. The same allele was also associated with delayed P3 latency (P = 0.005). Our results suggest that a SCZ risk variant in TCF4 is associated with neurophysiologic traits thought to index attention and working memory abnormalities in psychotic disorders. These findings suggest a mechanism by which TCF4 may contribute to the neurobiological basis of psychotic illness.

Faciobrachial dystonic seizures: the influence of immunotherapy on seizure control and prevention of cognitive impairment in a broadening phenotype.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awt212	Voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies, particularly those directed against leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1, are associated with a common form of limbic encephalitis that presents with cognitive impairment and seizures. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures have recently been reported as immunotherapy-responsive, brief, frequent events that often predate the cognitive impairment associated with this limbic encephalitis. However, these observations were made from a retrospective study without serial cognitive assessments. Here, we undertook the first prospective study of faciobrachial dystonic seizures with serial assessments of seizure frequencies, cognition and antibodies in 10 cases identified over 20 months. We hypothesized that (i) faciobrachial dystonic seizures would show a differential response to anti-epileptic drugs and immunotherapy; and that (ii) effective treatment of faciobrachial dystonic seizures would accelerate recovery and prevent the development of cognitive impairment. The 10 cases expand both the known age at onset (28 to 92 years, median 68) and clinical features, with events of longer duration, simultaneously bilateral events, prominent automatisms, sensory aura, and post-ictal fear and speech arrest. Ictal epileptiform electroencephalographic changes were present in three cases. All 10 cases were positive for voltage-gated potassium channel-complex antibodies (346-4515 pM): nine showed specificity for leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1. Seven cases had normal clinical magnetic resonance imaging, and the cerebrospinal fluid examination was unremarkable in all seven tested. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures were controlled more effectively with immunotherapy than anti-epileptic drugs (P = 0.006). Strikingly, in the nine cases who remained anti-epileptic drug refractory for a median of 30 days (range 11-200), the addition of corticosteroids was associated with cessation of faciobrachial dystonic seizures within 1 week in three and within 2 months in six cases. Voltage-gated potassium channel-complex antibodies persisted in the four cases with relapses of faciobrachial dystonic seizures during corticosteroid withdrawal. Time to recovery of baseline function was positively correlated with time to immunotherapy (r = 0.74; P = 0.03) but not time to anti-epileptic drug administration (r = 0.55; P = 0.10). Of 10 cases, the eight cases who received anti-epileptic drugs (n = 3) or no treatment (n = 5) all developed cognitive impairment. By contrast, the two who did not develop cognitive impairment received immunotherapy to treat their faciobrachial dystonic seizures (P = 0.02). In eight cases without clinical magnetic resonance imaging evidence of hippocampal signal change, cross-sectional volumetric magnetic resonance imaging post-recovery, after accounting for age and head size, revealed cases (n = 8) had smaller brain volumes than healthy controls (n = 13) (P < 0.001). In conclusion, faciobrachial dystonic seizures can be prospectively identified as a form of epilepsy with an expanding phenotype. Immunotherapy is associated with excellent control of the frequently anti-epileptic drug refractory seizures, hastens time to recovery, and may prevent the subsequent development of cognitive impairment observed in this study.

Somatosensory Evoked Potentials and Electroencephalography during Carotid Endarterectomy Predict Late Stroke but not Death.	DOI: 10.1016/j.avsg.2016.07.064	Late stroke and death rates are anticipated to be higher in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) compared with healthy counterparts. However, little is known regarding predictors other than the baseline comorbidities. We have recently shown that dual intraoperative somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring improves the ability to predict perioperative strokes. We seek to determine if dual intraoperative monitoring (IOM) can further predict long-term strokes and death.

Do cholesterol-lowering agents affect brain activity? A comparison of simvastatin, pravastatin, and placebo in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1994.tb04268.x	1. The effects of simvastatin and pravastatin on measures of central nervous system activity were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised crossover study. 2. Twenty-five healthy volunteers sequentially took 40 mg day-1 simvastatin, 40 mg day-1 pravastatin or placebo for 4 weeks, separated by a 4-6 week washout phase. 3. CNS measures included EEG evoked potentials, power spectral analysis, Leeds Sleep Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety Depression (HAD) Scale, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST); biochemical measures included plasma cholesterol, liver enzymes (gamma-GT, AST, ALT) and creatine kinase. 4. Mean cholesterol concentrations with both drugs were significantly lower than with placebo, and the cholesterol-lowering effect was greater with simvastatin. There were no significant differences between treatment in EEG evoked potentials, HAD Scale, or DSST scores. On the sleep measure, subjects reported significantly greater difficulty in getting to sleep while on simvastatin than on pravastatin, but neither score differed from placebo. No significant correlations were observed between sleep ratings and either plasma cholesterol concentrations or EEG evoked potentials. 5. The study showed that, while both drugs reduced plasma cholesterol concentrations, neither exerted significant effects, compared with placebo, on EEG evoked potentials, mood, sleep, or cognitive performance after 4 weeks of chronic administration in healthy volunteers.

Effects of azapropazone on pain-related brain activity in human subjects.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1995.tb05799.x	1. The dose-related effects of azapropazone on (i) event-related and spontaneous EEG-activity and (ii) the subjects' pain ratings were investigated using an experimental human pain model based on both chemo-somatosensory event-related potentials (CSSERP) and subjects' pain ratings. 2. Healthy subjects (n = 20) participated in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, four-way cross-over study. Single doses of azapropazone (300 mg, 600 mg and 1200 mg) and placebo were administered intravenously. Each experiment consisted of five sessions (before and 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after administration of the medication). Each session lasted for approximately 40 min. In the first 20 min, pain was induced by short CO2-stimuli presented to the right nostril (phasic pain; interstimulus interval 30 s) and EEG was recorded from five positions. CSSERPs were obtained in response to painful CO2-stimuli. In the following 20 min period, tonic pain was induced by a constant stream of dry air introduced in the left nostril. Subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic pain by means of a visual analogue scale. Additionally, a frequency analysis of the spontaneous EEG was performed. 3. Azapropazone reduced the pain-related CSSERP-amplitudes at frontal and parietal recording positions. This topographical pattern was observed in previous studies with opioids, while NSAIDs such as flurbiprofen and ketoprofen exerted effects at frontal and central positions. In contrast to other NSAIDs, administration of azapropazone resulted in a reduction of the frequency bands alpha 1, delta and theta of the spontaneous EEG. At the subjective level, analgesic effects of azapropazone were observed in the ratings of tonic pain. 4. Analgesic properties of azapropazone were demonstrated in man. The topographical pattern of the changes in the CSSERPs and the effects on EEG background activity suggest a central component of the analgesic action of azapropazone.

Predictive value of early continuous amplitude integrated EEG recordings on outcome after severe birth asphyxia in full term infants.	DOI: 10.1136/fn.72.1.f34	The background pattern in single channel amplitude integrated EEG recordings (aEEG) was recorded in 47 infants within the first six hours after birth to see if this could predict outcome after birth asphyxia. The aEEG background pattern during the first six hours of life was continuous and of normal voltage in 26 infants. All these infants survived; 25 were healthy, one had delayed psychomotor development. A continuous but extremely low voltage pattern was present in two infants, both of whom survived with severe handicap. Five infants had flat (mainly isoelectric) tracings during the first six hours of life; four died in the neonatal period, and one survived with severe neurological handicap. Burst-suppression pattern was identified in 14 infants, of whom five died, six survived with severe handicap, and three were healthy at follow up. The type of background pattern recorded within the first six postnatal hours in the aEEG tracings predicted outcome correctly in 43 of 47 (91.5%) infants. Use of aEEG monitoring can predict outcome, with a high degree of accuracy, after birth asphyxia, within the first six hours after birth. The predictive value of a suppression-burst pattern was, however, somewhat lower than the other background patterns. The aEEG seems to be a feasible technique for identifying infants at high risk of subsequent brain damage who might benefit from interventionist treatment after asphyxia.

Quantitative EEG effects and drug plasma concentration of phenobarbital, 50 and 100 mg single-dose oral administration to healthy volunteers: evidence of early CNS bioavailability.	DOI: 10.1159/000119453	Single, 50- and 100-mg oral doses of phenobarbital and a matching placebo were administered double-blind to 8 young, healthy male subjects. Multilead electroencephalographic (EEG) samples were recorded prior to, and at regular intervals within the 2 h following administration. The EEG signal was processed by power spectral analysis; the drug plasma concentration was assessed concomitantly. Plasma peaks after the 50- and 100-mg dose were, respectively, 3.38 +/- 1.29 and 4.09 +/- 1.24 micrograms/ml. Despite the low drug plasma concentration, a systematic power increment of the EEG fast frequency spectral segments occurred at either dose on the anterior scalp areas from the 30- or 60-min postdrug control onward, and was preponderant on central electrodes; a significant correlation (Kendal's coefficient for ranked data) with the drug plasma concentration was observed limitedly to the anterior scalp areas. No correlation with plasma levels was observed for unsystematic EEG variations.

Pharmacodynamic evaluation of codeine using tooth pulp evoked potentials.	DOI: 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1996.tb04166.x	Pain assessment in human volunteers is difficult, and it often requires a large number of subjects to show analgesic efficacy with statistical significance. Electrical tooth pulp stimulation elicits a painful sensation and produces an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal that can be recorded from the scalp when precisely controlled dental stimuli are delivered. These somatosensory evoked potentials (EP) consist of a series of peaks or waves each characterized by their polarity, latency, and amplitude. They are obtained by processing the EEG signals that occur after tooth pulp stimulation. There is good correlation between subjective pain reports and evoked potential amplitudes (N150-P250 component). Thus, EP may provide a useful model for the assessment of analgesic activity in human volunteers. We describe an improved method for producing and recording tooth pulp evoked potentials in six healthy subjects. Only 16 EEG epochs were necessary to get a reproducible EP response from the participants. The approach was applied to study the efficacy of codeine (60 mg administered orally); a decrease in the evoked potential amplitudes after codeine administration was observed. The data were consistent with results from visual analog pain ratings given by the subjects.

Opioid Specific Effects on Central Processing of Sensation and Pain: A Randomized, Cross-Over, Placebo-Controlled Study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpain.2021.06.011	Moderate to severe pain is often treated with opioids, but central mechanisms underlying opioid analgesia are poorly understood. Findings thus far have been contradictory and none could infer opioid specific effects. This placebo-controlled, randomized, 2-way cross-over, double-blinded study aimed to explore opioid specific effects on central processing of external stimuli. Twenty healthy male volunteers were included and 3 sets of assessments were done at each of the 2 visits: 1) baseline, 2) during continuous morphine or placebo intravenous infusion and 3) during simultaneous morphine + naloxone or placebo infusion. Opioid antagonist naloxone was introduced in order to investigate opioid specific effects by observing which morphine effects are reversed by this intervention. Quantitative sensory testing, spinal nociceptive withdrawal reflexes (NWR), spinal electroencephalography (EEG), cortical EEG responses to external stimuli and resting EEG were measured and analyzed. Longer lasting pain (cold-pressor test - hand in 2° water for 2 minutes, tetanic electrical), deeper structure pain (bone pressure) and strong nociceptive (NWR) stimulations were the most sensitive quantitative sensory testing measures of opioid analgesia. In line with this, the principal opioid specific central changes were seen in NWRs, EEG responses to NWRs and cold-pressor EEG. The magnitude of NWRs together with amplitudes and insular source strengths of the corresponding EEG responses were attenuated. The decreases in EEG activity were correlated to subjective unpleasantness scores. Brain activity underlying slow cold-pressor EEG (1-4Hz) was decreased, whereas the brain activity underlying faster EEG (8-12Hz) was increased. These changes were strongly correlated to subjective pain relief. This study points to evidence of opioid specific effects on perception of external stimuli and the underlying central responses. The analgesic response to opioids is likely a synergy of opioids acting at both spinal and supra-spinal levels of the central nervous system. Due to the strong correlations with pain relief, the changes in EEG signals during cold-pressor test have the potential to serve as biomarkers of opioid analgesia. PERSPECTIVE: This exploratory study presents evidence of opioid specific effects on the pain system at peripheral and central levels. The findings give insights into which measures are the most sensitive for assessing opioid-specific effects.

The effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on electroencephalography microstates of patients with heroin-addiction.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2023.111594	The effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation in treating substance use disorders are gaining attention; however, most existing studies used subjective measures to examine the treatment effects. Objective electroencephalography (EEG)-based microstate analysis is important for measuring the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with heroin addiction. We investigated dynamic brain activity changes in individuals with heroin addiction after transcranial magnetic stimulation using microstate indicators. Thirty-two patients received intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Resting-state EEG data were collected pre-intervention and 10 days post-intervention. The feature values of the significantly different microstate classes were computed using a K-means clustering algorithm. Four EEG microstate classes (A-D) were noted. There were significant increases in the duration, occurrence, and contribution of microstate class A after the iTBS intervention. K-means classification accuracy reached 81.5%. The EEG microstate is an effective improvement indicator in patients with heroin addiction treated with iTBS. Microstates were examined using machine learning; this method effectively classified the pre- and post-intervention cohorts among patients with heroin addiction and healthy individuals. Using EEG microstate to measure heroin addiction and further exploring the effect of iTBS in patients with heroin addiction merit clinical investigation.

EEG spectral power and mean frequencies in early heroin abstinence.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2003.09.022	The purpose of the present study was to investigate cumulative heroin effects on brain functioning by studying relationships among electroencephalography (EEG) spectral power and mean frequencies and heroin abuse history. Eyes-closed resting EEG data were collected from the 19 monopolar electrode sites in 33 heroin abusers and 13 age-matched healthy volunteers. The mean age of the patients was 23.1+/-4.5 years, the duration of daily heroin abuse (DDHA) ranged from 4 to 44 months, the intravenous doses of heroin ranged from 0.04 to 1.00 g/day, the abstinence length ranged from 6 days to 4.5 months. General linear model (GLM) repeated measures procedure revealed a significant group effect on the distribution of the mean power spectrum between bands and mean frequencies in almost all analyzed derivations. Further analysis demonstrated that these intergroup differences were diversely related to at least three aspects of heroin-taking history. Frequency shifts in alpha2 range, most prominent in frontal and central derivations, were related to duration of daily heroin consumption. Slowing of alpha1 mean frequency, most prominent in central, temporal, and occipital derivations, was registered mainly in heroin addicts who abused high doses of the drug. Spectral power characteristics of brain electrical activities in our patient population were strongly predicted by abstinence length. The present results give grounds to suppose that chronic heroin-taking induces neuronal oscillation frequency changes, which may contribute to the development of antisocial trends and some semantic processes disturbances in these patients. Supplementary neurophysiological deficit is characteristic for heroin addicts who takes high doses of the drug, however, its relation to heroin abuse remains unclear. Pronounced desynchronization is observed in acute heroin withdrawal, and spectral power characteristics tend to normalize almost completely during several weeks of abstinence.

Is electrical brain activity a reliable biomarker for opioid analgesia in the gut?	DOI: 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2011.00727.x	The effects of morphine on brain potentials after experimental gut pain have never been investigated. This study explored whether multi-channel-evoked brain potentials (EP) and corresponding dipole sources in the brain would reflect the effects of morphine on experimental oesophageal pain. In a crossover study, the effects of oral morphine (30 mg) or corresponding placebo on pain from electrical oesophageal stimulation were tested in 12 healthy male volunteers. The electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was monitored with 64 surface recordings. Pain was assessed by subjective scores on a visual analogue scale, amplitude and latency of the vertex-EP as well as on multi-channel recordings of EPs. Finally, electrical brain sources after pain stimuli were modelled from the EEG data. Morphine attenuated subjective pain scores (p = 0.008). The amplitude of the P2 peak (230 msec. post-stimulus) in the vertex EPs was unaltered after treatment with morphine, whereas after placebo treatment, it decreased (p = 0.03). However, the overall topography changed and the source of P1 (100 msec. post-stimulus), possibly originating from areas near the cingulate gyrus, changed localization in an upward, posterior direction (p = 0.04). The length of the vector describing this shift correlated inversely with the magnitude of the subjective pain relief (r = -0.7; p = 0.02). With the potential of becoming a useful biomarker in analgesic trials, the localization of the dipole sources reflected the analgesic action of morphine after pain stimuli of the gut. Even though further evaluation of the method is necessary, it has the potential to be a valid objective biomarker for opioid analgesia.

Differential effect of codeine on thermal nociceptive sensitivity in sleepy versus nonsleepy healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1037/a0018899	Basal sleepiness-alertness modulates drug effects. Sleepiness produced by sleep restriction leads to increased nociceptive sensitivity, suggesting opioid analgesia may also be modulated by sleepiness-alertness. This study compared thermal nociceptive sensitivity in sleepy versus nonsleepy participants after codeine or placebo. Twelve healthy normal adults, 18 to 35 years of age, had an 8-hr nocturnal polysomnogram (NPSG) followed by a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT; Carskadon and Dement, 1987). All had sleep efficiencies > 80% on their NPSG; 6 had average MSLT >or= 8 min (nonsleepy group) and 6 had latencies < 8 min (sleepy group). Participants were assessed following 8-hr time-in-bed with standard MSLT, and nociceptive assessments (using a radiant heat stimulation method) were conducted the following day with codeine 30 mg b.i.d. (0900 and 1300) or placebo b.i.d. Finger withdrawal latency (FWL) in seconds was measured to 5 different heat intensities randomly presented to the index finger pad of each hand. Mean +/- 1 SD MSLT values in the sleepy group were 4.72 +/- 1.83 min and 13.04 +/- 4.90 min in the nonsleepy group. As hypothesized, increased FWL (decreased nociception) was observed with lower heat intensities, codeine, and in the nonsleepy group. More important, there was a Group x Drug interaction with codeine increasing FWL in the nonsleepy, but not the sleepy, group. These data show the analgesic effects of codeine are diminished in sleepy versus nonsleepy individuals. They suggest clinical differences in response to analgesics are partly explained by basal state of sleepiness-alertness.

The effects of analgesics on central processing of tonic pain: A cross-over placebo controlled study.

Altered neural processing of social reward in male heroin abstainers.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2022.04.005	Individuals who are addicted to drugs often face unfavourable social conditions and difficulty with social adaptation. Both may be closely related to impaired social cognitive ability. This study posits that social cognitive impairments likely arise from blunted social reward processing in drug users. This study aimed to explore the electrophysiological mechanism of social reward processing in people who abstain from using heroin (heroin abstainers). Twenty-eight male heroin abstainers and 27 matched controls completed the social incentive delay task. At the same time, their corresponding behaviour and electroencephalography data were recorded. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) elicited by positive outcomes was significantly more positive than that elicited by negative outcomes for the healthy controls. However, no significant difference in FRN was found between negative and positive outcomes among the heroin abstainers. There was no significant difference in P3 (a positive event-related potential component after FRN) elicited by negative and neutral outcomes in the heroin abstainers. Meanwhile, negative outcomes elicited greater P3 than neutral outcomes in the healthy controls. In addition, this study also found that withdrawal time was negatively correlated with the difference wave of FRN for the heroin abstainers. Heroin abstainers may be hyposensitive to the processing of social reward outcomes. In other words, they may have insufficient motivation to acquire social rewards. Abnormal social reward processing found in heroin abstainers can be improved with an increase in abstinence time. These results deepen our understanding of the social reward impairments associated with chronic drug use.

Support vector machine classification of multi-channel EEG traces: a new tool to analyze the brain response to morphine treatment.	DOI: 10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627820	The analgesic effect of morphine is highly individual, calling for objective methods to predict the subjective pain relief. Such methods might be based on alteration of brain response caused by morphine during painful stimuli. The study included 11 healthy volunteers subjectively quantifying perception of painful electrical stimulations in the esophagus. Brain evoked potentials following stimulations were recorded from sixty-four electroencephalographic channels at baseline and ninety minutes after morphine administration. Marginals obtained from discrete wavelet coefficients for each channel were used as input to an optimized support vector machine classifying between baseline and after morphine administration. The electroencephalographic channel leading to the best performance was further analyzed to identify brain alterations caused by morphine. Marginals from volunteers with no analgesic effect were examined for differences in comparison to volunteers with effect. The single-channel classification showed best performance at electrode P4 with 84.1 % of the traces classified correctly. When combining features from the 6 best performing channels, the multichannel classification increased to 92.4 %. The most discriminative feature was a decrease in the delta band (0.5 - 4 Hz) after morphine for volunteers with analgesic effect. Volunteers with no effect of morphine showed an increase in the delta band after drug administration. As only a proportion of patients benefit from opioid treatment, the new approach may help to identify non-responders and guide individualized tailored analgesic therapy.

No contribution of morphine-6-glucuronide to clinical morphine effects after short-term administration.		The primary metabolite of morphine, morphine-6-beta-glucuronide (M-6-G), is reported to contribute to the effects of morphine. The authors investigated the effects of M-6-G on the central nervous system (CNS) after short-term intravenous (i.v.) administration by employing both electroencephalograph (EEG) power spectra analyses and clinical signs as indicators of opioid effects. Three dosages of M-6-G, one dosage of morphine (bolus 10 mg/70 kg and 3.5 mg/70 kg/hour for 4 hours), a combination of morphine and M-6-G, and placebo were administered to 20 healthy volunteers as i.v. bolus plus i.v. infusion for 4 hours. M-6-G was dosed to produce steady state plasma concentrations that were either identical, 2 times, or 3 times higher than the M-6-G plasma concentrations observed after administration of morphine. The EEG background activity and clinical effects were recorded 3.5 hours after the infusion started. M-6-G failed to produce effects on any of the investigated EEG or clinical parameters at the doses tested. In contrast, morphine produced a significant increase in the alpha 1 and delta power of the EEG. In addition, morphine increased the subjects' ratings of tiredness, sickness, vertigo, and drowsiness, and decreased their level of performance in a tracking task. It was concluded that after short-term i.v. administration, M-6-G does not affect the CNS at the doses tested. Therefore, its contribution to clinical effects of morphine after short-term administration is questionable. The missing CNS effects were probably caused by the slow brain permeability of M-6-G, which in short-term treatment might not attain effective CNS concentrations.

Morphine modifies the cingulate-operculum network underlying painful rectal evoked potentials.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.10.020	The effect of opioids on brain networks underlying rectal evoked potentials (EPs) has never been investigated. This study utilized brain source connectivity to explore whether morphine induced changes in brain networks underlying painful rectal EPs would reflect changes in pain scores due to morphine. Twenty healthy volunteers were included in this placebo-controlled cross-over study. Sensory and pain thresholds to electrically induced rectal stimulation were taken before (baseline) and 70 min after placebo/morphine (30 mg) administration. The stimulation intensity required to evoke moderate pain at baseline was employed for EPs. The pain score of this stimulation intensity was recorded again 70 min after placebo/morphine administration. 62-channel EPs were recorded for both arms. Amplitudes and latencies were analysed and brain source connectivity analysis was done. Changes in any of the parameters describing EPs were correlated to changes in subjective pain ratings. Morphine increased sensory and pain thresholds by 28.8% and 27.5% (P ≤ 0.02). The pain score corresponding to moderate pain at baseline was attenuated in both placebo and morphine arms by 14.5% and 37.5% (P < 0.05). There was a 33.9% reduction in EP amplitudes due to placebo (P < 0.05), whereas EP amplitudes remained stable due to morphine. A dominating cingulate-operculum network to rectal pain was seen. Cingulate source shifted anteriorly in the morphine arm (P < 0.001) and this shift was positively correlated to the change in the pain score (r = 0.6, P < 0.05). These findings indicate that visceral pain relief due to morphine is associated with reorganization within cingulate cortex, which may be used as a biomarker of opioid effects.

The coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorders in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awt152	In Parkinson's disease, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is an early non-dopaminergic syndrome with nocturnal violence and increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep that can precede Parkinsonism by several years. The neuronal origin of rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder in Parkinson's disease is not precisely known; however, the locus subcoeruleus in the brainstem has been implicated as this structure blocks muscle tone during normal rapid eye movement sleep in animal models and can be damaged in Parkinson's disease. Here, we studied the integrity of the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex in patients with Parkinson's disease using combined neuromelanin-sensitive, structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging approaches. We compared 24 patients with Parkinson's disease and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, 12 patients without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and 19 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent clinical examination and characterization of rapid eye movement sleep using video-polysomnography and multimodal imaging at 3 T. Using neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, reduced signal intensity was evident in the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus area in patients with Parkinson's disease that was more marked in patients with than those without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Reduced signal intensity correlated with the percentage of abnormally increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep. The results confirmed that this complex is affected in Parkinson's disease and showed a gradual relationship between damage to this structure, presumably the locus subcoeruleus, and abnormal muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, which is the cardinal marker of rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. In longitudinal studies, the technique may also provide early markers of non-dopaminergic Parkinson's disease pathology to predict the occurrence of Parkinson's disease.

Donepezil impairs memory in healthy older subjects: behavioural, EEG and simultaneous EEG/fMRI biomarkers.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0024126	Rising life expectancies coupled with an increasing awareness of age-related cognitive decline have led to the unwarranted use of psychopharmaceuticals, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), by significant numbers of healthy older individuals. This trend has developed despite very limited data regarding the effectiveness of such drugs on non-clinical groups and recent work indicates that AChEIs can have negative cognitive effects in healthy populations. For the first time, we use a combination of EEG and simultaneous EEG/fMRI to examine the effects of a commonly prescribed AChEI (donepezil) on cognition in healthy older participants. The short- and long-term impact of donepezil was assessed using two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In both cases, we utilised cognitive (paired associates learning (CPAL)) and electrophysiological measures (resting EEG power) that have demonstrated high-sensitivity to age-related cognitive decline. Experiment 1 tested the effects of 5 mg/per day dosage on cognitive and EEG markers at 6-hour, 2-week and 4-week follow-ups. In experiment 2, the same markers were further scrutinised using simultaneous EEG/fMRI after a single 5 mg dose. Experiment 1 found significant negative effects of donepezil on CPAL and resting Alpha and Beta band power. Experiment 2 replicated these results and found additional drug-related increases in the Delta band. EEG/fMRI analyses revealed that these oscillatory differences were associated with activity differences in the left hippocampus (Delta), right frontal-parietal network (Alpha), and default-mode network (Beta). We demonstrate the utility of simple cognitive and EEG measures in evaluating drug responses after acute and chronic donepezil administration. The presentation of previously established markers of age-related cognitive decline indicates that AChEIs can impair cognitive function in healthy older individuals. To our knowledge this is the first study to identify the precise neuroanatomical origins of EEG drug markers using simultaneous EEG/fMRI. The results of this study may be useful for evaluating novel drugs for cognitive enhancement.

Neurovascular coupling in Parkinson's disease patients: effects of dementia and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment.	DOI: 10.3233/JAD-2010-101140	Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) lead to a cholinergic deficit in the brain which is not only related to dementia, but may also lead to a disturbed neurovascular coupling. We investigated the effect of cholinergic decline on neurovascular coupling in PD patients. Patients with idiopathic PD were divided in groups without (n=59; 65 ± 9 y) or with moderate dementia as specified by Mini-Mental State Examination. The demented patients were assigned to groups with (n=55; 73 ± 6 y) or without (n=61; 72 ± 8 y) acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment. Neurovascular coupling was assessed by a simultaneous electroencephalography-Doppler technique applying a contrast-based visual stimulation task. Visually evoked potential amplitudes (N75-P100) and parameters of the hemodynamic response in the posterior cerebral artery were obtained using a control system approach (resting flow velocity, gain, attenuation, rate time, and natural frequency). Data were compared to a healthy control group of a similar age range (n=20; 63 ± 8 yr). Compared to controls, patient groups presented no differences in evoked potential amplitudes or neurovascular coupling parameters. The reported 30% decline in acetylcholinesterase activity in PD patients did not lead to measurable changes in neurovascular coupling. In AD patients additional factors might explain the uncoupling and higher cerebrovascular risk detected in clinical studies.

Human brain networks: a graph theoretical analysis of cortical connectivity normative database from EEG data in healthy elderly subjects.	DOI: 10.1007/s11357-020-00176-2	Moving from the hypothesis that aging processes modulate brain connectivity networks, 170 healthy elderly volunteers were submitted to EEG recordings in order to define age-related normative limits. Graph theory functions were applied to exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography on cortical sources in order to evaluate the small-world parameter as a representative model of network architecture. The analyses were carried out in the whole brain-as well as for the left and the right hemispheres separately-and in three specific resting state subnetworks defined as follows: attentional network (AN), frontal network (FN), and default mode network (DMN) in the EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, gamma). To evaluate the stability of the investigated parameters, a subgroup of 32 subjects underwent three separate EEG recording sessions in identical environmental conditions after a few days interval. Results showed that the whole right/left hemispheric evaluation did not present side differences, but when individual subnetworks were considered, AN and DMN presented in general higher SW in low (delta and/or theta) and high (gamma) frequency bands in the left hemisphere, while for FN, the alpha 1 band was lower in the left with respect to the right hemisphere. It was also evident the test-retest reliability and reproducibility of the present methodology when carried out in clinically stable subjects.Evidences from the present study suggest that graph theory represents a reliable method to address brain connectivity patterns from EEG data and is particularly suitable to study the physiological impact of aging on brain functional connectivity networks.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, hybrid parallel-arm study of low-dose naltrexone as an adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment for major depressive disorder.	DOI: 10.1186/s13063-022-06738-3	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. The current treatments are ineffective in approximately one-third of patients, resulting in a large economic burden and reduced quality of life for a significant proportion of the global population. There is considerable evidence that increased inflammation may distinguish a sub-type of MDD, and there are no validated diagnostic tools or treatments for neuroinflammation in MDD patients. The current study aims to explore the potential role of low-dose naltrexone (LDN), a drug with purported anti-inflammatory properties in the central nervous system, as an adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD.

Laser-evoked potentials as a tool for assessing the efficacy of antinociceptive drugs.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ejpain.2009.05.001	Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) are brain responses to laser radiant heat pulses and reflect the activation of Adelta nociceptors. LEPs are to date the reference standard technique for studying nociceptive pathway function in patients with neuropathic pain. To find out whether LEPs also provide a useful neurophysiological tool for assessing antinociceptive drug efficacy, in this double-blind placebo-controlled study we measured changes induced by the analgesic tramadol on LEPs in 12 healthy subjects. We found that tramadol decreased the amplitude of LEPs, whereas placebo left LEPs unchanged. The opioid antagonist naloxone partially reversed the tramadol-induced LEP amplitude decrease. We conclude that LEPs may be reliably used in clinical practice and research for assessing the efficacy of antinociceptive drugs.

Nociceptive threshold in patients with epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1016/0920-1211(92)90092-8	Clinical practitioners have often observed in the course of their daily work that the pain thresholds of epileptic patients seem to differ from those of healthy subjects. These patients can suffer from quite severe traumatic lesions without apparently experiencing any pain. Since they are usually under treatment for epilepsy, it is difficult to determine whether the absence of pain is due to these patients' epileptic condition or to its treatment, since most antiepileptic drugs also have analgesic effects. In the present study, it was proposed to assess the pain thresholds of 15 epileptic patients (10 with tonic-clonic seizures generalized at outset and 5 with temporal lobe epilepsy), by measuring the leg flexion nociceptive reflex (or RIII reflex) threshold: the stimulation threshold at which this reflex is triggered is known to be correlated with the pain threshold. The nociceptive threshold of the patients with generalized epilepsy was not found to differ from that of the control population, whereas that of the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy was spontaneously high and was not reversed upon injecting naloxone. These data are discussed from the point of view of the pain pathways and mechanisms possibly involved.

Intravenous lipid emulsion given to volunteers does not affect symptoms of lidocaine brain toxicity.	DOI: 10.1111/bcpt.12321	Intravenous lipid emulsion has been suggested as treatment for local anaesthetic toxicity, but the exact mechanism of action is still uncertain. Controlled studies on the effect of lipid emulsion on toxic doses of local anaesthetics have not been performed in man. In randomized, subject-blinded and two-phase cross-over fashion, eight healthy volunteers were given a 1.5 ml/kg bolus of 20% Intralipid(®) (200 mg/ml) or Ringer's acetate solution intravenously, followed by a rapid injection of lidocaine 1.0 mg/kg. Then, the same solution as in the bolus was infused at a rate of 0.25 ml/kg/min. for 30 min. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded, and 5 min. after lidocaine injection, the volunteers were asked to report subjective symptoms. Total and un-entrapped lidocaine plasma concentrations were measured from venous blood samples. EEG band power changes (delta, alpha and beta) after the lidocaine bolus were similar during lipid and during Ringer infusion. There were no differences between infusions in the subjective symptoms of central nervous system toxicity. Lidocaine was only minimally entrapped in the plasma by lipid emulsion, but the mean un-entrapped lidocaine area under concentration-time curve from 0 to 30 min. was clearly smaller during lipid than Ringer infusion (16.4 versus 21.3 mg × min/l, p = 0.044). Intravenous lipid emulsion did not influence subjective toxicity symptoms nor affect the EEG changes caused by lidocaine.

Effects of upper airway anaesthesia on respiratory-related evoked potentials in humans.	DOI: 10.1183/09031936.05.00139804	Cortical potentials evoked by mid-inspiratory occlusion arise from numerous receptors, many of which are probably within the upper airway. Their precise nature is not known. The aim of the current study was to improve knowledge of this by studying the effects of topical upper airway anaesthesia on respiratory-related evoked potentials. Respiratory-related evoked potentials were described through the averaging of electroencephalogram (EEG) epochs following mid-inspiratory occlusions (C3-CZ; C4-CZ). A total of 21 healthy volunteers (13 male, aged 22-52 yrs) were studied during mouth breathing, before and after topical upper airway anaesthesia (lidocaine). Moreover, 15 subjects were studied during nose breathing with and without anaesthesia. Six subjects were studied whilst inhaling L-menthol. Typical potentials were present in all the subjects, their components featuring normal amplitudes and latencies. The route of breathing and upper airway anaesthesia did not modify the EEG responses to inspiratory occlusions, qualitatively or quantitatively, during mouth or nose breathing. L-menthol had no effect. Upper airway receptors sensitive to topical anaesthesia are unlikely to contribute significantly to mid-inspiratory occlusion-evoked potentials. On the contrary, deeper receptors, such as joint and muscle receptors, could contribute dominantly to these potentials.

Effects of local anesthetics on experiential, physiologic and endocrine measures in healthy humans and on rat hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone release in vitro: clinical and psychobiologic implications.		Local anesthetics, given i.v. to treat cardiac arrhythmias and for regional anesthesia, exert prominent central nervous system side effects, such as sensory distortions and mood changes. In experimental animals, these drugs activate limbic structures, such as the amygdala, that may coordinately regulate sensory processing, mood and pituitary hormone secretion during stress. Clinically relevant i.v. doses of the short-acting local anesthetic procaine were administered to 17 healthy volunteers and topographic electroencephalographic (EEG) spectra, stress-responsive neuroendocrine and cardiovascular parameters and sensory-cognitive and mood changes were examined. Because corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mimics the behavioral and physiologic responses to stress and activates limbic structures in experimental animals, the effects of procaine and lidocaine on immunoreactive CRH release from rat hypothalami in vitro were also explored. Procaine administration produced a dose-related increase in fast (21-50 Hz) EEG activity, a significant decrease in alpha EEG activity and dose-dependent increases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol and prolactin secretion. Dose-dependent increases in sensory distortions involved virtually all modalities, particularly auditory, visual and somatosensory. Mood changes occurred in most subjects, including anxiety, euphoria and arousal. In vitro, procaine and lidocaine both produced significant dose-related increases in immunoreactive CRH release from rat hypothalami, maximal at 10(-6) M, that were blocked by carbamazepine, a limbic anticonvulsant used in the management of mood disorders. The electrophysiologic effects of procaine in these volunteers were analogous to local anesthetic effects in experimental animals and consistent with the activation of subcortical structures localized within the temporal lobe, such as the amygdala. The effects of procaine on stress-responsive neurohormones were similar to those of amygdala stimulation both in experimental animals and human subjects. The in vitro data suggested that procaine-induced pituitary-adrenal activation involves stimulation of hypothalamic CRH, although additional (e.g., limbic-hypothalamic) mechanisms may contribute in vivo. These data were compatible with a direct action of local anesthetics on limbic structures that might account for many of the central effects seen with the systemic use of these agents in clinical practice.

Upper airway anesthesia delays arousal from airway occlusion induced during human NREM sleep.	DOI: 10.1152/jappl.1992.73.2.642	"Six healthy subjects (5 males and 1 female, 26-40 yr old) were studied during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep to assess the role of upper airway (UA) afferents in the arousal response to induced airway occlusion. Subjects wore an airtight face mask attached to a low-resistance one-way valve. A valve in the inspiratory circuit allowed instantaneous inspiratory airway occlusion and release; the expiratory circuit remained unoccluded at all times. Each subject was studied during two nights. On one night, occlusions were created during stable stage 2 NREM sleep before and after application of 4% lidocaine to the oral and nasal mucosa. On the other night, the protocol was duplicated with saline (""sham anesthesia"") rather than lidocaine. The order of nights was randomized. Occlusions were sustained until electroencephalographic arousal. Three to 12 occlusions were performed in each subject for each of the four parts of the protocol (pre- and post-lidocaine, pre- and post-saline). The auditory threshold for arousal (1,500-Hz tone beginning at 30 dB) was also tested before and after UA lidocaine. For the group, arousal time after UA anesthesia was prolonged compared with preanesthesia arousal time (P less than 0.001); arousal time after sham anesthesia did not significantly increase from before sham anesthesia (P = 0.9). The increase in arousal time with UA anesthesia was greater than the increase with sham anesthesia (P less than 0.001). The auditory arousal threshold did not increase after UA anesthesia. Inspiratory mask pressure, arterial O2 saturation of hemoglobin, and end-tidal PCO2 during occlusions were similar before and after UA anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"	['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Adult', 'Anesthesia, General', 'Arousalphysiology', 'Electroencephalography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechanoreceptorsphysiology', 'Neurons, Afferentphysiology', 'Respiratory Physiological Phenomena', 'Respiratory Systeminnervation', 'Sleepphysiology']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1399992/	['Lidocaine']	[3676]	1399992	['1992', 'Aug']
Brain Functional Network and Amino Acid Metabolism Association in Females with Subclinical Depression.	DOI: 10.3390/ijerph19063321	This study aimed to investigate the association between complex brain functional networks and the metabolites in urine in subclinical depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from 78 female college students, including 40 with subclinical depression (ScD) and 38 healthy controls (HC). The phase delay index was utilized to construct functional connectivity networks and quantify the topological properties of brain networks using graph theory. Meanwhile, the urine of all participants was collected for non-targeted LC-MS metabolic analysis to screen differential metabolites. The global efficiency was significantly increased in the α-2, β-1, and β-2 bands, while the characteristic path length of β-1 and β-2 and the clustering coefficient of β-2 were decreased in the ScD group. The severity of depression was negatively correlated with the level of cortisone (p = 0.016, r = -0.40). The metabolic pathways, including phenylalanine metabolism, phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan biosynthesis, and nitrogen metabolism, were disturbed in the ScD group. The three metabolic pathways were negatively correlated (p = 0.014, r = -0.493) with the global efficiency of the brain network of the β-2 band, whereas they were positively correlated (p = 0.014, r = 0.493) with the characteristic path length of the β-2 band. They were mainly associated with low levels of L-phenylalanine, and the highest correlation sparsity was 0.11. The disturbance of phenylalanine metabolism and the phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine biosynthesis pathways cause depressive symptoms and changes in functional brain networks. The decrease in the L-phenylalanine level may be related to the randomization trend of the β-1 frequency brain functional network.

Salivary and hair glucocorticoids and sleep in very preterm children during school age.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.07.003	Very preterm birth involves increased stress for the child, which may lead to programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and poor sleep in later life. Moreover, there is evidence for a relationship between HPA axis activity and sleep. However, research with objective sleep measures in very preterm children during school-age is rare. Eighty-five healthy children born very preterm (<32nd gestational week) and 91 full-term children aged 7-12 years were recruited for the present study. To assess HPA axis activity, salivary cortisol was measured at awakening, 10, 20, and 30min later. In addition, hair cortisol and cortisone concentrations were quantified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to assess cumulative endocrine activity over the preceding months. One night of in-home polysomnographic sleep assessment was conducted to assess sleep duration, sleep continuity, and sleep architecture. Children born very preterm showed significantly lower levels of cortisol at awakening and lower overall post-awakening cortisol secretion, lower cortisone in hair, and earlier sleep onset than full-term children. Across the whole sample, overall post-awakening cortisol secretion was positively related to sleep onset time and negatively to sleep duration. The association between prematurity status and post-awakening cortisol secretion was partially mediated by earlier sleep onset time. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for a possible down-regulation of the HPA axis activity and slightly earlier sleep phase in very preterm children during school age.

Correlation between alpha activity and neuropsychometric tests in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135346	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to memory impairment and executive and visuospatial dysfunction as the disease progresses. Alpha activity on EEG has been related to cognition in previous studies. We aimed to investigate the correlation between alpha activity and neuropsychometric tests (NPTs) in PD patients. Fifty-five idiopathic PD patients and 20 healthy controls were included. The Standardized Mini-Mental Test (SMMT), Verbal Learning Memory Test (VLMT), Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), Stroop Color-Word Test, Categorical Verbal Fluency Test (CVFT), Benton's Face Recognition Test (BFR), and Benton Line Judgment Orientation Test (BLOT) were administered to all participants. Patients were separated into four groups according to NPT results: healthy controls (HC); PD patients with normal cognition (PDNC); PD patients with MCI (PDMCI); and PD patients with dementia (PDD). Analysis of the EEG data showed that HC had the highest alpha activity, and PDD had the lowest. High SMMT scores were correlated with high alpha activity at posterior electrode locations in all PD groups. VLMT and WMS test scores were associated with alpha activity at the parietal sites in PDMCI. VLMT, WMS, and CVFT test scores were correlated with alpha activity at parietooccipital sites in PDD. Verbal and visuospatial memory dysfunction related to low alpha activity was evident in both PDMCI and PDD, whereas executive dysfunction was more strongly associated with low alpha activity in PDD. Analysis of alpha activity could help clinicians predict the progression of cognitive dysfunction in PD patients.

Non-pharmacological treatment changes brain activity in patients with dementia.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-020-63881-0	Non-pharmacological treatment (NPT) improves cognitive functions and behavioural disturbances in patients with dementia, but the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. In this observational study, 21 patients with dementia received NPTs for several months. Patients were scanned using magnetoencephalography twice during the NPT period to evaluate NPT effects on resting-state brain activity. Additionally, cognitive functions and behavioural disturbances were measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-J) and a short version of the Dementia Behaviour Disturbance Scale (DBD-13) at the beginning and the end of the NPT period. In contrast to the average DBD-13 score, the average MMSE-J score improved after the NPT period. Magnetoencephalography data revealed a reduced alpha activity in the right temporal lobe and fusiform gyrus, as well as an increased low-gamma activity in the right angular gyrus. DBD-13 score changes were correlated with beta activity in the sensorimotor area. These findings corroborate previous studies confirming NPT effects on brain activity in healthy participants and people at risk of dementia. Our results provide additional evidence that brains of patients with dementia have the capacity for plasticity, which may be responsible for the observed NPT effects. In dementia, NPT might lead to improvements in the quality of life.

Auditory P3 in antidepressant pharmacotherapy treatment responders, non-responders and controls.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2013.03.003	Event-related potentials (ERPs), derived from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, can index electrocortical activity related to cognitive operations. The fronto-central P3a ERP is involved in involuntary processing of novel auditory information, whereas the parietal P3b indexes controlled attention processing. The amplitude of the auditory P3b has been found to be decreased in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, few studies have examined the relations between the P3b, the related P3a, and antidepressant treatment response. We tested 53 unmedicated individuals (25 females) with MDD, as well as 43 non-depressed controls (23 females) on the novelty oddball task, wherein infrequent deviant (target) and frequent standard (non-target) tones were presented, along with infrequent novel (non-target/distractor) sounds. The P3a and P3b ERPs were assessed to novel and target sounds, respectively, as were their accompanying behavioral performance measures. Depression ratings and the antidepressant response status were assessed following 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy with three different regimens. Antidepressant treatment non-responders had smaller baseline P3a/b amplitudes than responders and healthy controls. Baseline P3b amplitude also weakly predicted the extent of depression rating changes by week 12. Females exhibited larger P3a/b amplitudes than males. With respect to task performance, controls had more target hits than treatment non-responders. ERP measures correlated with clinical changes in males and with behavioral measures in females. These results suggest that greater (or control-like) baseline P3a/b amplitudes are associated with a positive antidepressant response, and that gender differences characterize the P3 and, by extension, basic attentive processes.

Sleep alterations in children with refractory epileptic encephalopathies: a polysomnographic study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.yebeh.2014.03.009	Data on the relationship between sleep disturbances and refractory epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) are scarce. Our aim was to assess, by means of nocturnal polysomnography, if children with EEs present with objective alterations in sleep organization. Twenty-three children with EEs (12 males; mean age: 8.7±1.4years) and 40 healthy controls (22 males; mean age: 8.8±1.1years) underwent an overnight full polysomnography (PSG). Relative to controls, children with EEs showed a significant reduction in all PSG parameters related to sleep duration time in bed (TIB-min p<0.001), total sleep time (TST-min p<0.001), and sleep percentage (SPT-min p<0.001), as well as significantly higher REM latency (FRL-min p<0.001), rate in stage shifting (p=0.005), and number of awakenings/hour (p=0.002). Relative to controls, children with EEs also showed significant differences in respiratory parameters (AHI/h p<0.001, ODI/h p<0.001, SpO2% p<0.001, SpO2 nadir% p<0.001) and a higher rate of periodic limb movements (PLMs% p<0.001). Our findings suggest that sleep evaluation could be considered mandatory in children with refractory epileptic encephalopathy in order to improve the clinical management and the therapeutic strategies.

Benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes: correlation between clinical, cognitive and EEG aspects.	DOI: 10.1590/s0004-282x2007000400004	"Benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS) is a form of epilepsy with no demonstrable anatomical lesion showing spontaneous seizure remission. During the active phase of the disease the children may show cognitive deficits. The objective of this study was to assess, in children with BECTS, the relationship between clinical-EEG aspects and performance in the school performance test (SPT), Raven's progressive matrixes test and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III). Forty-two 7 to 11 year old children were included and the following tests carried out: anamnesis, neurological examination, electroencephalogram (EEG), SPT, Raven's test and WISC-III. The children with BECTS had normal IQ values but showed inferior performance in the SPT more frequently than ""healthy"" children, paired with respect to age and maternal scholastic level. There was moderate positive correlation between WISC-III results and the age when the seizures started and the educational level of the parents. On the other hand, aspects linked to the epileptic nature of BECTS, such as the number of seizures, time since last seizure and the number and lateralization of the centro-temporal spikes on the EEG, showed no correlation with the neuropsychological tests."

Sleep EEG of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02191585	Twenty-two patients suffering from an obsessive and compulsive disorder (OCD) according to DSM-III-R were investigated by polysomnographic sleep EEG recordings under drug-free conditions and compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Sleep efficiency was significantly lower and wake % SPT was significantly increased in the patient group compared to healthy subjects. Sleep architecture did not differ among the two samples. Especially REM sleep measures, in particular, REM latency did not differ among the groups. No positive correlation was found between sleep variables and rating inventories for obsession and compulsions (Y-BOCS), depression (Hamilton) and anxiety (CAS). A secondary depression did not influence sleep EEG variables. The results of this study contradict the assumption that OCD patients show REM sleep and slow wave sleep abnormalities similar to those shown by patients with primary depression.

The effects of paroxetine and nefazodone on sleep: a placebo controlled trial.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02246410	We studied the effect of acute (1 day) and subacute (16 days) administration of the new antidepressant, nefazodone (400 mg daily), and the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), paroxetine (30 mg daily), on the sleep polysomnogram of 37 healthy volunteers using a random allocation, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Compared to placebo, paroxetine lowered rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increased REM latency. In addition, paroxetine increased awakenings and reduced Actual Sleep Time and Sleep Efficiency. In contrast, nefazodone did not alter REM sleep and had little effect on measures of sleep continuity. We conclude that in contrast to typical SSRIs, nefazodone administration has little effect on sleep architecture in healthy volunteers.

TMS-EEG signatures of glutamatergic neurotransmission in human cortex.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-021-87533-z	Neuronal activity in the brain reflects an excitation-inhibition balance that is regulated predominantly by glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, and often disturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we tested the effects of a single oral dose of two anti-glutamatergic drugs (dextromethorphan, an NMDA receptor antagonist; perampanel, an AMPA receptor antagonist) and an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker (nimodipine) on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials (TEPs) and TMS-induced oscillations (TIOs) in 16 healthy adults in a pseudorandomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover design. Single-pulse TMS was delivered to the hand area of left primary motor cortex. Dextromethorphan increased the amplitude of the N45 TEP, while it had no effect on TIOs. Perampanel reduced the amplitude of the P60 TEP in the non-stimulated hemisphere, and increased TIOs in the beta-frequency band in the stimulated sensorimotor cortex, and in the alpha-frequency band in midline parietal channels. Nimodipine and placebo had no effect on TEPs and TIOs. The TEP results extend previous pharmaco-TMS-EEG studies by demonstrating that the N45 is regulated by a balance of GABAAergic inhibition and NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic excitation. In contrast, AMPA receptor-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission contributes to propagated activity reflected in the P60 potential and midline parietal induced oscillations. This pharmacological characterization of TMS-EEG responses will be informative for interpreting TMS-EEG abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders with pathological excitation-inhibition balance.

Plasma concentration and CNS effects of Ca antagonists darodipine and nimodipine after single-dose oral administration to healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1159/000026614	The dynamics at the brain level (quantitative EEG), plasma kinetics and effects on blood pressure and heart rate of the Ca antagonists, darodipine (slow-release, 50- 200 mg) and nimodipine (30 mg), were compared in a double-blind cross-over study on healthy volunteers during a 9-hour period following single drug/placebo administration. Increased EEG total power was observed after 100 and 200 mg daropidine; a concomitant decrease of 14.5-32.0 Hz relative power was observed at 100 mg. The 50-mg dose proved ineffective. These effects were correlated with the darodipine plasma concentration only at the 100-mg dose, with indications of an active concentration interval at approximately 5-10 ng/ml; a reduction in diastolic blood pressure and increased heart rate proved to be linearly correlated with the drug plasma concentration throughout the entire concentration range. Comparable EEG effects were observed after nimodipine, but they did not correlate with the plasma concentration. Implications of the predictability of the brain effect from the drug plasma concentration and differential thresholds for the brain action and effects on (peripheral) circulation are suggested.

Nimodipine improves information processing in substance abusers.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1995.tb16571.x	We examined whether nimodipine can improve information processing in healthy drug abusers using cognitive event-related potential (ERP) methodology. Placebo and 30- and 60-mg doses of nimodipine were administered on separate days in a random double-blind design to twelve male subjects, who used cocaine and/or opiates as well as alcohol and marijuana. The subjects performed the auditory rare event monitoring (AREM) task and the paired letter version of the visual continuous performance task (CPT) before oral drug administration as well as one and two hours after drug ingestion. The EEG was recorded from 7 scalp locations. The P3 component of the ERPs to the target stimulus was reduced with repeated testing on the placebo day. The 30-mg dose of nimodipine blocked the decrease in P3, which reflects stimulus evaluation in both tasks. Chronic administration of nimodipine may alleviate the cognitive deficits observed in substance abusers during abstinence and prevent treatment relapse.

Influence of 3 antivertiginous medications on the vigilance of healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.5414/cpp41171	In the present randomized, comparative, double-blind, 3-way crossover study, possible effects of 3 antivertiginous medications on vigilance were investigated. 30 healthy volunteers received single doses of a fixed combination of cinnarizine 20 mg and dimenhydrinate 40 mg (Arlevert, ARL), dimenhydrinate 50 mg, or betahistine dimesylate 12 mg, in randomized order at 1-week intervals. Spontaneous brain electrical activity (EEG), acoustic late evoked potentials (ALEP) with P300, and reaction time were measured before and 90 (t90) and 180 minutes (t180) after drug intake. All 3 medications led to a delay of P300 (primary criterion) and a decrease of its amplitude. The maximum delay at t180 was found for dimenhydrinate (16.42 ms) and the lowest for betahistine (6.33 ms). Differences ARL vs dimenhydrinate and ARL vs betahistine were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Spectral analysis of spontaneous EEG showed slight and similar decreases in the power in the a-band under dimenhydrinate and ARL (p = 0.07 and p = 0.03 with respect to baseline, respectively), but basically no change under betahistine. There was no effect on reaction time by either medication. None of the subjects reported drowsiness or any other adverse event. The findings confirm the reported suitability of P300 latency for measurement of drug effects on brain activity, but provide no indication of concomitant impairment of performance capacity by the tested drugs. Global assessment of the results suggests that the fixed combination cinnarizine 20 mg/dimenhydrinate 40 mg exerts only a minor effect on vigilance, not significantly different from betahistine, which is commonly regarded as a non-sedating antivertiginous drug	['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Betahistineadministration & dosageadverse effectstherapeutic use', 'Braindrug effectsphysiology', 'Cinnarizineadministration & dosageadverse effectstherapeutic use', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dimenhydrinateadministration & dosageadverse effectstherapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Combinations', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'Event-Related Potentials, P300drug effects', 'Evoked Potentials, Auditorydrug effects', 'Female', 'Histamine Agonistsadministration & dosageadverse effectstherapeutic use', 'Histamine H1 Antagonistsadministration & dosageadverse effectstherapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reaction Timedrug effects', 'Time Factors']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12708605/	['N-methyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine', 'Xanthine', 'Cinnarizine', 'PYRIDINE', 'Dimenhydrinate', 'Diphenhydramine', 'Piperazine']	[2366, 1188, 1547484, 1049, 10660, 3100, 4837]	12708605	['2003', 'Apr']

The Dynamics of Resting-State EEG and Salivary Trace Elements in Patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.	DOI: 10.1021/acschemneuro.3c00697	The study of salivary microelements and their neurophysiological and behavioral correlates in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a pressing issue in modern psychiatry, which, however, lacks adequate research at this time. In this study, we tested the dynamics of behavioral parameters, resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG), and salivary iron, copper, manganese, magnesium, and zinc in 30 healthy volunteers and 30 individuals with OCD before and after an emotional antisaccade task. The eye-movement data served as a measure of behavioral performance. Our research revealed consistently higher manganese concentrations in the OCD group compared to healthy volunteers associated with a higher EEG ratio of amplitude transformation and symptom severity. The dynamics of salivary microelements and resting-state EEG, possibly influenced by cognitive and emotional load during the anticsaccade task, differed between groups. In healthy volunteers, there was a decrease in salivary iron level with an increase in high-frequency power spectral density of EEG. The OCD group showed a decrease in salivary copper with an increased Hjorth mobility of EEG.

Cortical facilitation of somatosensory inputs using gravity-related tactile information in humans with vestibular hypofunction.	DOI: 10.1152/jn.00406.2022	"A few years after their bilateral vestibular loss, patients usually show a motor repertoire that is almost back to normal. This recovery is thought to involve an upregulation of the visual and proprioceptive information that compensates for the lack of vestibular information. Here, we investigated whether plantar tactile inputs, which provide body information relative to the ground and to the Earth vertical, contribute to this compensation. More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that somatosensory cortex response to electric stimulation of the plantar sole in standing adults will be greater in humans (n = 10) with bilateral vestibular hypofunction (VH) than in an age-matched healthy group (n = 10). Showing significantly greater somatosensory evoked potentials (i.e., P1N1) in VH than in control subjects, the electroencephalographic recordings supported this hypothesis. Furthermore, we found evidence that increasing the differential pressure between both feet, by adding a 1-kg mass at each pendant wrist, enhanced the internal representation of body orientation and motion relative to a gravitational reference frame. The large decrease in alpha power in the right posterior parietal cortex (and not in the left) is in line with this assumption. Finally, behavioral analyses showed that trunk oscillations were smaller than head oscillations in VH and showed a reverse pattern for healthy participants. These findings are consistent with a tactile-based postural control strategy in the absence of vestibular input and a vestibular-based control strategy in healthy participants where the head serves as a reference for balance control.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Somatosensory cortex excitability is greater in participants with bilateral vestibular hypofunction than in age-matched healthy humans. To control balance, healthy humans ""locked"" the head whereas participants with vestibular hypofunction ""locked"" their pelvis. For participants with vestibular hypofunction, increasing loading/unloading of the feet enhances the internal representation of body state in the posterior parietal cortex."

Expression of Ceruloplasmin in the Peripheral Blood of Patients With Drug-Resistant Epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1002/jcph.2183	This study was performed to detect the expression of ceruloplasmin in the peripheral blood of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and explore the mechanisms of iron metabolism disorder in drug-resistant epilepsy. Peripheral blood was collected from 32 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, labeled the drug-resistant group; 30 patients who were drug responsive, labeled the drug-responsive group; and 34 healthy people, named the normal group.The expression levels of ceruloplasmin mRNA and ceruloplasmin protein in the peripheral blood of the 3 groups were detected using real-time fluorescence-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The differences in the expression of ceruloplasmin mRNA of different seizure frequencies and types, electroencephalogram abnormal discharges, and different medication methods were analyzed and compared. The relative expression of ceruloplasmin mRNA and ceruloplasmin protein in the drug-resistant epilepsy group was significantly higher than that in the drug-responsive group (P = .002 and .010, respectively) and higher in the drug-responsive group compared with the normal group (P = .014 and .005, respectively). The relative expression of ceruloplasmin mRNA in patients with epilepsy using different medication methods was statistically significant (P = .001). Patients who received a combination of 2 or 3 drugs exhibited a higher expression than those treated with single-drug treatment, whereas those who received a combination of 3 drugs had a higher expression than those with 2 drugs (P = .013, .001, and .011, respectively). There was no significant difference in the relative expression of Cp mRNA in patients with epilepsy with different seizure frequencies and types and abnormal electroencephalogram discharges (all P > .05). The increased expression of ceruloplasmin in the peripheral blood of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy was closely related to the different medication methods, but no obvious correlation with epileptic seizure frequencies or types and abnormal electroencephalogram discharges was identified. The increased expression of ceruloplasmin enhanced iron oxidative damage and may be the potential mechanism of drug-resistant epilepsy and may be one of the drug resistance indicators for combination drugs when treating drug-resistant epilepsy.

Iron deficiency (ID) at both birth and 9 months predicts right frontal EEG asymmetry in infancy.	DOI: 10.1002/dev.21388	This study considered effects of timing and duration of iron deficiency (ID) on frontal EEG asymmetry in infancy. In healthy term Chinese infants, EEG was recorded at 9 months in three experimental conditions: baseline, peek-a-boo, and stranger approach. Eighty infants provided data for all conditions. Prenatal ID was defined as low cord ferritin or high ZPP/H. Postnatal ID was defined as ≥ two abnormal iron measures at 9 months. Study groups were pre- and postnatal ID, prenatal ID only, postnatal ID only, and not ID. GLM repeated measure analysis showed a main effect for iron group. The pre- and postnatal ID group had negative asymmetry scores, reflecting right frontal EEG asymmetry (mean ± SE: -.18 ± .07) versus prenatal ID only (.00 ± .04), postnatal ID only (.03 ± .04), and not ID (.02 ± .04). Thus, ID at both birth and 9 months was associated with right frontal EEG asymmetry, a neural correlate of behavioral withdrawal and negative emotions.

Delayed CNS maturation in iron-deficient anaemic infants.	DOI: 10.1179/147683008X301342	Direct evidence of CNS developmental alterations in iron-deficient anaemic (IDA) infants was obtained. Twenty 3-15-month-old IDA and 20 non-IDA infants (age and gender matched), healthy in every other respect, were studied. Complete blood and iron kinetics tests determined an IDA status. Psychomotor development was assessed through the test of Rogers and co-workers [Rogers SJ, Donovan CM, D'Eugenio D, Brown SL, Whiteside E, Moersch MS, Schafer DS. (eds) Developmental Programming for Infants and Young Children, Vol 2. University of Michigan Press, 1981] and under the 10-20 International System qEEG was performed (sleep/stage II). A Pearson's correlation test was applied between haematological, psychomotor and broad band EEG variables, and through ANOVA psychomotor and AP means were compared. IDA infants showed lower scores in cognition, fine motor and social/emotional areas, higher delta/theta and lower alpha power. Most correlations between haematological/psychological variables were positive. Delta/theta correlations were negative with self-care/gross and motor items while alpha/beta AP showed positive correlations with psychomotor and haematological variables. A clear association was found between EEG alterations and a low haematological/iron profile leading to a delayed psychomotor development.

Iron deficiency anemia in infancy: long-lasting effects on auditory and visual system functioning.	DOI: 10.1203/01.PDR.0000047657.23156.55	Evoked potentials provide noninvasive measures of nerve transmission and CNS functioning. Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) show dramatic changes in infancy, largely as a result of progressive myelination. Because iron is required for normal myelination, pathway transmission in these sensory systems might be affected by early iron deficiency. We previously reported evidence to that effect: infants with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) had slower transmission through the auditory brainstem pathway, uncorrected by iron therapy. To determine long-term effects, ABR and/or VEP of healthy Chilean children who were treated for IDA or were nonanemic in infancy were compared at approximately 4 y of age. Absolute latencies for all ABR waves and interpeak latencies (except I-III interval) were significantly longer in former IDA children. Longer latency was also observed for the P100 wave on VEP. The magnitude of differences was large-about 1 SD. These findings, with differences in latencies but not amplitudes, further support the hypothesis that IDA in infancy alters myelination and provide evidence that effects on transmission through the auditory and visual systems can be long lasting. Subtle changes in sensory pathway transmission might be an underlying mechanism for the derailment of other developmental aspects in early IDA.

Nutrition status and brain function in aging.	DOI: 10.1093/ajcn/52.1.93	Biochemical indices of nutrition status assessed in 28 healthy persons aged greater than 60 y were related to cognitive performance and electroencephalographic (EEG) indices of neuropsychological function. Performance data were most frequently related to indices of nutrition status when tasks were demanding. Numerous correlations were also found between EEG indices and indices of thiamin, riboflavin, and iron nutriture. Certain observations, such as a decrement in alpha-wave activity in the EEG of subjects with low thiamin status, suggest that subtle neuropsychological impairment can occur in association with mild deficits in nutrition status. Other findings indicate that EEG frequency responses of older subjects with high iron status are similar to those of younger persons; however, these data are more difficult to interpret. The results suggest that further research on nutrition and neuropsychological function will lead to a better understanding of the role of nutrition in maintaining the functional integrity of the aging brain.

Single-trial classification of neural responses evoked in rapid serial visual presentation: effects of stimulus onset asynchrony and stimulus repetition.	DOI: 10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943832	Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks, in which participants are presented with a continuous sequence of images in one location, have been used in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) in a variety of Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) applications. The RSVP task is advantageous because it can be performed at a high temporal rate. The rate of the RSVP sequence is controlled by the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between subsequent stimuli. When used within the context of a BMI, an RSVP task with short SOA could increase the information throughput of the system while also allowing for stimulus repetitions. However, reducing the SOA also increases the perceptual degradation caused by presenting two stimuli in close succession, and it decreases the target-to-target interval (TTI), which can increase the cognitive demands of the task. These negative consequences of decreasing the SOA could affect on the EEG signal measured in the task and degrade the performance of the BMI. Here we systematically investigate the effects of SOA and stimulus repetition (r) on single-trial target detection in an RSVP task. Ten healthy volunteers participated in an RSVP task in four conditions that varied in SOA and repetitions (SOA=500 ms, r=1; SOA=250 ms, r=2; SOA=166 ms, r=3; and SOA=100 ms, r=5) while processing time across conditions was controlled. There were two key results: First, when controlling for the number of repetitions, single-trial performance increases when the SOA decreases. Second, when the repetitions were combined, the best performance (AUC=0.967) was obtained with the shortest SOA (100 ms). These results suggest that shortening the SOA in an RSVP task has the benefit of increasing the performance relative to longer SOAs, and it also allows a higher number of repetitions of the stimuli in a limited amount of time.

Relationship between EEG beta power abnormality and early diagnosis of cognitive impairment post cerebral hemorrhage.	DOI: 10.1177/1550059412471336	Cerebral hemorrhage is a common disease of older adults, which could increase the risk of cognitive impairment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics can be analyzed to investigate the applied value in the assessment of cognitive impairment of the patients with cerebral hemorrhage. One hundred eighty-two patients (including patients with cognitive impairment [CHCI] and patients with cognitive normality [CHNC] with cerebral hemorrhage, and 120 normal healthy persons [control; CN]) were recruited between July 2008 to March 2012 at the department of neurology. All patients were analyzed by EEG, and analysis results were compared to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, using the methods of correlation analysis, clustering analysis, and concordance analysis. The results indicated that patients with CHCI had significantly lower EEG beta power (0.814 ± 0.113 mcV(2)) relative to CHNC (1.601 ± 0.186 mcV(2), P < .01) or CN group (1.713 ± 0.201 mcV(2), P < .01). Significant negative correlation was found between the beta power and hemorrhage region, age, hemorrhage size, hemorrhage amount (r 1 = -.92223, r 2 = -.81084, r 3 = -.79258, r 4 = -.84961, respectively, all P < .001). There was good concordance between K-means clustering algorithm calculating the beta power and MoCA scoring (Kappa = 0.899, P < .001). In conclusion, the preliminary findings suggest that the recognition techniques of EEG hold considerable promise for the assessment of cognitive impairment post cerebral hemorrhage, which negatively related to the hemorrhage region, hemorrhage size, hemorrhage amount, and age.

Effect of the new H1-antagonist ReN1869 on capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia in human skin/Human phase-I trial using somatosensory evoked potentials induced by a CO2 laser.	DOI: 10.1055/s-0031-1296957	Extensive pre-clinical investigations have shown that the tricyclic compound ReN1869 ((R)-1-(3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-1-propyl)-3-piperidine carboxylic acid, CAS 170149-99-2) is a potent H1-antagonist with pronounced antinociceptive properties. In this human phase-I trial the effect of different acute and multiple doses of ReN1869 on capsaicin induced neurogenic inflammation and hyperalgesia was investigated. Twenty-one healthy male subjects were enrolled in this randomised, double-blind, three-period, crossover trial design--consisting of acute and one week b.i.d. oral administration of 25 and 50 mg doses of ReN1869 and matching placebo--separated by 3 week washout periods. Capsaicin solution (1%) (INCI: Capsicum frutescens--containing capsaicinoides from Capsicum annuum annuum, CAS 84603-55-4) was applied in an occlusive mode for 30 min on the skin of the back in all three acute and subchronic medication periods to induce neurogenic inflammation. When the nociceptive laser pulses were applied to the capsaicin pre-treated skin, ReN1869 exerted a highly significant reduction of the pain response--as predominantly detected by suppression of the (central) P2-component in the laser-induced somatosensory evoked potentials (LSEPs) from Vertex-EEG. The primary efficacy endpoint, the N1/P2 peak to peak amplitude, was significantly reduced with the administration of ReN1869--primarily by a suppression of the P2-component of the LSEP. This suppression was dose-dependent and was more pronounced after a one week treatment (subchronic mode) with ReN1869 than after the first dose (acute mode). In contrast to the (central) P2-component there was no significant effect on the (peripheral) N1-component of the LSEPs taken from capsaicin-treated skin. As ReN1869 had no significant effect when the laser pulses were applied to normal skin, and the compound's effect was mainly restricted to the (central) P2-component, when LSEPs were taken from capsaicin treated skin, it can be concluded that ReN1869 exerts its positive effect to reduce capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia by a primarily central mechanism.

Predictors of successful self control during brain-computer communication.	DOI: 10.1136/jnnp.74.8.1117	Direct brain-computer communication uses self regulation of brain potentials to select letters, words, or symbols from a computer menu to re-establish communication in severely paralysed patients. However, not all healthy subjects, or all paralysed patients acquire the skill to self regulate their brain potentials, and predictors of successful learning have not been found yet. Predictors are particularly important, because only successful self regulation will in the end lead to efficient brain-computer communication. This study investigates the question whether initial performance in the self regulation of slow cortical potentials of the brain (SCPs) may be positively correlated to later performance and could thus be used as a predictor.

Pharmacodynamic studies on the central mode of action of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) infusions in elderly subjects, utilizing EEG mapping and psychometry.	DOI: 10.1007/s00702-002-0768-6	In a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study, the acute and subacute effects of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), or ademetionine, on brain function and behavior of 10 elderly normal healthy volunteers (5 males and 5 females, aged 56-71 years, mean: 59.3 years) were investigated by means of EEG mapping and psychometry. In random order they received infusions of 800 mg SAMe and placebo, administered over 30 minutes for 7 days, with a wash-out period of 3 weeks in between. EEG recordings and psychometric tests were carried out 0, 1, 3 and 6 hours after drug administration on days 1 and 7. Multivariate analysis based on MANOVA/Hotelling T(2) tests demonstrated significant central effects of SAMe as compared with placebo after acute, subacute and superimposed drug administration. Acute SAMe-induced changes were characterized by a decrease in total power, an increase in absolute delta and a decrease in absolute alpha power, further by an increase in relative delta and a decrease in relative alpha power, a slowing of the delta/theta centroid as well as a slowing of the centroid of the total power spectrum. These changes are typical of classical antidepressants of the thymoleptic type such as imipramine and amitriptyline. After one week of daily infusions there was a marked increase in total power, reminiscent of nootropic drug effects. One additional superimposed dosage mitigated these effects in the direction of an antidepressant profile, with the inter-drug differences waning in the 6(th) hour. Our pharmaco-EEG findings suggest both inhibitory and excitatory drug effects underlying the antidepressant properties of SAMe well-documented in clinical trials. Psychometric tests concerning noopsychic and thymopsychic measures as well as critical flicker frequency generally demonstrated a lack of differences between SAMe and placebo, which again reflects a good tolerability of the drug in elderly subjects.

Ten young, normal healthy volunteers of both sexes, with a mean age of 25.2+3.9 yr received, in random order, infusions of 800 mg ADE in 250 ml of isotonic solution, and placebo consisting of 250 ml of isotonic solution administered over 30 min for 7 d, with a wash-out period of 3 wk in between. EEG recordings and psychometric tests were carried out 0, 1, 3 and 6 h after drug administration on days 1 and 7. While there were no significant changes in psychometric findings, multivariate analyses of the EEG results based on MANOVA/Hotelling T 2 tests demonstrated significant encephalotropic effects of ADE compared to placebo. ADE-induced changes were characterized by a decrease in total power, an increase in absolute delta power and a decrease in absolute alpha and beta power, further by an increase in relative delta and beta power and a decrease in relative alpha power, a slowing of the delta/theta centroid, an acceleration of the alpha centroid as well as a slowing of the centroid of the total power spectrum. These changes are typical of classical antidepressants of the thymoleptic type such as imipramine and amitriptyline. Time-efficacy calculations demonstrated a significant central effect of ADE in the first hour after the first infusion, declining slowly until the third hour and thereafter steeply until the sixth hour; a further significant effect was after 1 wk of daily infusions and in the third hour after one superimposed infusion on day 7 of subacute treatment.

REM-suppressing effects of amitriptyline and amitriptyline-N-oxide after acute medication in healthy volunteers: results of two uncontrolled pilot trials.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2007-1014515	Almost all tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants as well as the MAO (monoamineoxidase) inhibitors suppress REM sleep significantly and sustainedly. This does not seem to be an epiphenomenon of antidepressant pharmacotherapy, since initial REM sleep suppression during pharmacological treatment correlated positively with antidepressant effect after three weeks. Furthermore, selective REM-sleep deprivation (by waking patients) had a marked antidepressive effect in depressed patients. The present study used rapid eye movement (REM) sleep suppression in healthy volunteers as a marker to compare the central nervous effects of 150 mg amitriptylineoxide (AMINO) with those of 75 mg amitriptyline (AMI). Both compounds exerted comparable sleep-inducing effects; suppression of REM sleep tended to be more pronounced after application of AMI, despite the higher dose of AMINO used. While this result is evidence of the immediate central nervous effects of a single dose of AMINO, they seem less marked than those of AMI.

To develop such a procedure we applied an artificial neural network to preprocessed single-channel EEG activity. EOG and EMG information was purposely not provided as input to the network. A generalized back-propagation algorithm was used for computer simulation. The sleep profile scored manually according to Rechtschaffen and Kales served as the desired output during the training period and as standard for the judgement of the network output during working mode. Polysomnographic recordings from 5 healthy subjects were pooled to train the network, whereas second-night EEG recordings from the same subjects were used as independent working data sets. We further applied the network to the data of 5 depressive patients without medication and 6 depressive patients treated with amitriptyline. For these groups between 84.9 and 88.6% out of all time periods consisting of 20 s of continuous EEG activity were correctly classified. The indicator function of REM sleep was well approximated by the network output in the course of the night. Especially the REM onset was excellently recognized. The inclusion of patient data in the training set yielded a different network, which was evaluated and compared.

Japanese sake yeast supplementation improves the quality of sleep: a double-blind randomised controlled clinical trial.	DOI: 10.1111/jsr.12336	Activation of adenosine A2a receptors in cerebral neurons induces sleep in various mammals. It was previously found that Japanese sake yeast enriched in adenosine analogues activates A2a receptors in vitro and induces sleep in mice. Here it is reported that sake yeast activated A2a receptors in a cultured human cell line and improved human sleep quality in a clinical trial. Sake yeast activated A2a receptors in HEK cells in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 40 μg mL(-1), and the activation was attenuated almost completely by the A2a receptor antagonist ZM241385 with an IC50 of 73 nm. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover clinical study, 68 healthy participants ingested tablets containing either 500 mg of sake yeast powder or a placebo (cellulose) 1 h before sleep for 4 days. Electroencephalograms were recorded during sleep at home with a portable device for 4 week days. Electroencephalogram analyses revealed that sake yeast supplementation significantly (P = 0.03) increased delta power during the first cycle of slow-wave sleep by 110%, without changing other sleep parameters. Sake yeast supplementation also significantly increased growth hormone secretion in the urine on awakening by 137% from 3.17 ± 0.41 (placebo) to 4.33 ± 0.62 (sake yeast) pg mg(-1) creatinine (P = 0.03). Subjective sleepiness (P = 0.02) and fatigue (P = 0.06) in the morning were improved by sake yeast. Given these benefits and the absence of adverse effects during the study period, it was concluded that sake yeast supplementation is an effective and safe way to support daily high-quality, deep sleep.

Early and late contingent negative variation (CNV) reflect different aspects of deficits in schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1111/ejn.16340	Abnormal reward processing and psychomotor slowing are well-known in schizophrenia (SZ). As a slow frontocentral potential, contingent negative variation (CNV) is associated with anticipatory attention, motivation and motor planning. The present study aims to evaluate the early and late amplitude and latencies of CNV in patients with SZ compared to healthy controls during a reward processing task and to show its association with clinical symptoms. We recruited 21 patients with SZ and 22 healthy controls to compare early and late CNV amplitude and latency values during a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task between groups. Patients' symptom severity, levels of negative symptoms and depressive symptoms were assessed. Clinical features of the patients were further examined for their relation with CNV components. In conclusion, we found decreased early CNV amplitudes in SZ during the reward condition. They also displayed diminished and shortened late CNV responses for incentive cues, specifically at the central location. Furthermore, early CNV amplitudes exhibited a significant correlation with positive symptoms. Both CNV latencies were linked with medication dosage and the behavioural outcomes of the MID task. We revealed that early and late CNV exhibit different functions in neurophysiology and correspond to various facets of the deficits observed in patients. Our findings also emphasized that slow cortical potentials are indicative of deficient motivational processes as well as impaired reaction preparation in SZ. To gain a deeper understanding of the cognitive and motor impairments associated with psychosis, future studies must compare the effects of CNV in the early and late phases.

Reduced Reward Processing in Schizophrenia: A Comprehensive EEG Event-Related Oscillation Study.	DOI: 10.1007/s10548-023-01021-3	It is well known that abnormal reward processing is a characteristic feature of various psychopathologies including schizophrenia (SZ). Reduced reward anticipation has been suggested as a core symptom of SZ. The present study aims to evaluate the event-related oscillations (EROs) delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma in patients with SZ during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, which elicits the neural activity of reward processing. Twenty-one patients with SZ and twenty-two demographically matched healthy controls were included in the study. EROs were compared between groups and correlation analyses were conducted to determine a possible relationship between clinical scores and ERO values. Compared with healthy controls, the SZ group had reduced (1) delta and theta amplitudes in the reward condition (2) total beta and non-incentive cue-related beta amplitudes, and (3) incentive cue-related frontal gamma amplitudes. These reductions can be interpreted as impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission and disrupted cognitive functioning in the reward processing of SZ. In contrast, SZ patients showed higher incentive cue-related theta and occipital gamma amplitudes compared to controls. These increments may reflect negative symptoms in SZ. Moreover, theta amplitudes showed a negative correlation with Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia scores and a positive correlation with attentional impulsivity. This is the first study showing the impairments of SZ patients in EROs from delta to gamma frequency bands compared with healthy controls during reward anticipation. Being the first comprehensive study, our results can be interpreted as providing evidence for disrupted brain dynamics in the reward processing of SZ studied by EROs. It may become possible to help patients' wellness by improving our understanding of reward processing in schizophrenia and developing innovative rehabilitation treatments based on these findings.

Effects of Pharmacological Treatments in Alzheimer's Disease: Permutation Entropy-Based EEG Complexity Study.	DOI: 10.1007/s10548-022-00927-8	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative brain disease affecting cognitive and physical functioning. The currently available pharmacological treatments for AD mainly contain cholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-I) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists (i.e., memantine). Because brain signals have complex nonlinear dynamics, there has been an increase in interest in researching complexity changes in the time series of brain signals in individuals with AD. In this study, we explore the electroencephalographic (EEG) complexity for making better observation of pharmacological therapy-based treatment effects on AD patients using the permutation entropy (PE) method. We examined EEG sub-band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) complexity in de-novo, monotherapy (AChE-I), dual therapy (AChE-I and memantine) receiving AD participants compared with healthy elderly controls. We showed that each frequency band depicts its own complexity profile, which is regionally altered between groups. These alterations were also found to be associated with global cognitive scores. Overall, our findings indicate that entropy measures could be useful to show medication effects in AD.

Effects of tolterodine, trospium chloride, and oxybutynin on the central nervous system.	DOI: 10.1177/00912700122010528	Antimuscarinic compounds are increasingly used to treat the symptoms of overactive bladder; however, their use is often restricted by peripheral adverse effects (AEs). On the other hand, data regarding their influence on the central nervous system (CNS) are limited. This randomized, single-blind, parallel-group quantitative-topographical EEG (qEEG) study of clinical phase I investigates the potential CNS adverse effects of the three antimuscarinic drugs--tolterodine, oxybutynin, and trospium chloride--in comparison to placebo. Overall, 4 x 16 (total 64) young, healthy male volunteers were included in the study. The subjects were given either placebo or the clinically recommended daily doses of the drugs dispensed in three doses on a single day (tolterodine 2 mg bid and once placebo, total 4 mg/d; oxybutynin 5 mg tid, total 15 mg/d; and trospium chloride 15 mg tid, total 45 mg/d). The qEEG was recorded prior to and up to 4 hours after each intake of the trial medication (a total of 10 qEEG sessions) under three different conditions: at rest with eyes open, eyes closed, and under mental demand. The drug tolerability was subjectively evaluated by the volunteer and the investigator. In comparison to placebo (10% confidence interval), tolterodine and trospium chloride did not induce changes of the qEEG power in five of the six frequency bands (i.e., delta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2). Isolated power decreases were only observed in the theta frequency band. In contrast, oxybutynin caused significant power reductions in four frequency bands (theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta 1; p < 0.01). The subjectively evaluated drug tolerability was comparable between all treatment groups, although differences in the AE occurrence existed, with the AE frequency being higher in the oxybutynin group. The results of this study support the findings that oxybutynin as a tertiary amine crosses the blood-brain barrier, causing significant qEEG activity changes and more pronounced central adverse effects. Although tolterodine is also a tertiary amine, it shows limited effects on qEEG activity (i.e., slight theta power reductions), comparable to the effects of trospium chloride, a quarternary amine, which barely crosses the blood-brain barrier. The minimal qEEG changes observed with tolterodine and trospium chloride reflect most probably a rebound message from the peripheral target organs. Prescription of oxybutynin thus implicates a higher risk of CNS side effects.

Influences of trospium chloride and oxybutynin on quantitative EEG in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00191165	Trospium chloride and oxybutynin are two antimuscarinergic agents used in the treatment of unstable bladder, urge incontinence, combined stress urge incontinence and detrusor hyperreflexia. The possibility that these two drugs produce changes in central nervous electrical activity was examined in an open, prospective, phase I study involving 12 volunteers. Quantitative evaluation of the multichannel electroencephalogram obtained from young healthy volunteers showed statistically significant decreases in alpha and beta 1 activity after oxybutynin, but not after intravenous or oral administration of trospium chloride. The biological activity of both drugs was ascertained by continuous simultaneous recording of the heart rate. A decrease in heart rate was detected after oral administration of oxybutynin, and an increase was seen after i.v. administration of trospium chloride. The results suggest that trospium chloride is less likely to produce central nervous adverse effects than to oxybutynin.

Melatonin and S-20098 increase REM sleep and wake-up propensity without modifying NREM sleep homeostasis.	DOI: 10.1152/ajpregu.1997.272.4.R1189	The pineal hormone melatonin has been implicated in the circadian regulation of sleep. In a crossover design, we investigated the effect of acute administration of 5 mg melatonin and a melatonin agonist (S-20098, 5 and 100 mg) in healthy young men when given 5 h before bedtime on sleep structure and electroencephalogram (EEG) power density. Each trial comprised a baseline, a treatment, and a posttreatment sleep episode. Relative to the placebo condition, all treatments phase advanced the core body temperature rhythm [Kräuchi, K., C. Cajochen, D. Möri, C. Hetsch, and A. Wirz-Justice. Sleep Res. 24: 526, 1995; and Kräuchi, K., C. Cajochen, D. Möri, and A. Wirz-Justice. Am. J. Physiol. 272 (Regulatory Integrative Comp. Physiol. 41): R1178-1188, 1997]. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was increased after both melatonin and S-20098. This increase in REM sleep was most pronounced in the first REM sleep episode. On the posttreatment night after melatonin and S-20098 administration, more wakefulness was present in the latter one-half of the sleep episode. EEG power density between 0.25 and 20 Hz during either non-REM (NREM) or REM sleep did not differ from placebo. Thus a single early evening dose of melatonin or the agonist S-20098 increases REM sleep propensity and advances sleep termination while, at the same time, the EEG in NREM sleep remains unaffected.

Similar effects on infants of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids supplementation to pregnant and lactating women.	DOI: 10.1542/peds.108.5.e82	There have been indications that high intake of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy may increase birth weight and gestational length. In addition, n-3 long-chain PUFAs may be important for the neurobiological development of the infants. High levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3) are found in the gray matter of the cerebral cortex and in the retina, and it seems as if the availability of long-chain PUFAs may be limiting cerebral development. The fetus and the newborn are dependent on a high supply from their mothers, either via the placenta or via breast milk.

Cholecystokinin-induced effects on selective attention depend on level of activation.	DOI: 10.1159/000119368	Cholecystokinin (CCK)-like peptides, such as ceruletide, have been found to improve selective attention as indicated by the processing negativity (PN) of the event-related brain potential. The present study compared effects of ceruletide and placebo after intravenous administration of ceruletide on the PN in healthy subjects classified into two groups scoring high versus low on self-reported activation. Following placebo, PN (at Fz) was somewhat larger in subjects with low than high activation (p < 0.1). Administration of the CCK analog decreased PN in low-activation subjects but increased PN in the highly activated group (p < 0.01). Results suggest that the effects of CCK on selective attention depend on a modulation of central nervous mechanisms underlying activation.

Ceruletide improves event-related potential indicators of cognitive processing in young but not in elderly humans.	DOI: 10.1097/00004714-199612000-00006	"The effect of intravenously administered ceruletide, a cholecystokinin (CCK) analogue, on neurophysiologic signs of stimulus processing was tested in 16 young (19-28 years) and 16 aged (70-86 years) healthy subjects.

Thereafter, auditory event-related brain potential (AERP) responses to stimuli of an ""oddball"" task (including the random presentation of frequent standard tones and rare target tones) were recorded. Amplitudes of the P2, P3, and SW components of the AERP were reduced in aged subjects (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, and p < 0.01, respectively), and latencies (from stimulus onset) of the N2 and P3 components were prolonged (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Together, these changes indicate impaired cognitive processing capabilities in aged compared with young subjects. Ceruletide enhanced P3 and also the subsequent slow-wave (SW) component that occurs 500 to 700 ms poststimulus in young subjects (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). The peptide did not at all affect AERPs in the elderly subjects. Results demonstrate the capability of ceruletide after systemic administration to enhance central nervous system indicators of cognitive processing such as P3 and SW in young subjects. However, despite the clear effect of the CCK analogue in young subjects, it remained ineffective in the group of aged subjects and, thus, failed to compensate for the decline in AERP signs of working memory functioning in the elderly subjects."

Improved event-related potential signs of selective attention after the administration of the cholecystokinin analog ceruletide in healthy persons.	DOI: 10.1016/0006-3223(94)00207-J	Cholecystokinin (CCK) is co-localized with dopamine (DA) in neurons of the mesolimbic-frontocortical dopamine (DA) system, considered essential for the pathology of psychotic behavior and associated attention deficits. The present experiments in 13 healthy men aimed at examining the effects of the CCK analog ceruletide on attention as reflected by event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Subjects were tested according to a double-blind cross-over design on three occasions, following intravenous infusion of placebo, 0.5 microgram ceruletide, and 2.5 micrograms ceruletide. ERPs were recorded during the subject's performance on an auditory selective attention task including the concurrent presentation of frequent standard tones and infrequent deviant tones which the subject had to listen to, or to ignore. The processing negativity (PN) over frontocentral cortical areas, reflecting selective attention, was higher after ceruletide than placebo, this increase being most pronounced after the 2.5 micrograms dose (placebo -1.29 +/- 0.38 microV versus ceruletide -3.02 +/- 0.65 microV, p < .05). ERP signs of a general increase in cortical arousal after ceruletide did not reach significance. Likewise, mismatch negativity, an indicator of preattentive processing of stimulus deviance, was not significantly affected by the peptide. The results indicate that ceruletide affects human brain function primarily by improving selective attention.

Breathe-squeeze: pharmacodynamics of a stimulus-free behavioural paradigm to track conscious states during sedation☆.

We report the use of a stimulus-free behavioural paradigm to track state transitions in responsiveness during dexmedetomidine sedation. We hypothesised that estimated dexmedetomidine effect-site (Ce) concentrations would be higher at loss of responsiveness (LOR) compared with return of responsiveness (ROR), and both would be lower than comparable studies that used stimulus-based assessments.

Effects of clonidine on MMN and P3a amplitude in schizophrenia patients on stable medication.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-019-0351-6	Schizophrenia is a complex brain disease involving several neurotransmitter systems, including aberrant noradrenergic activity, which might underlie cognitive deficits. Clonidine is an α2A-agonist and previous research has demonstrated that single dosages of clonidine normalize sensori(motor) gating in schizophrenia. Currently, we investigated whether clonidine is able to normalize mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a amplitude deficits in this same group of patients. This is important, since reports have shown that MMN amplitude is associated with cognitive functioning and daily life functions in schizophrenia. Twenty chronically ill, male schizophrenia patients were tested with the MMN paradigm from the Copenhagen Psychophysiological Test Battery (CPTB) on 5 occasions, separated by a week. Patients received randomized, yet balanced, either a placebo or a single dose (25, 50, 75 or 150 μg) of clonidine (each dose only once) on top of their usual medication on each occasion. Patients were matched on age and gender with 20 healthy controls (HC) who did not receive any treatment. We found decreased MMN and P3a amplitudes in our patients compared to HC. Although clonidine did neither significantly increase MMN nor P3a amplitude in our patients, it did increase certain levels of MMN and P3a amplitude such that these were not significantly different anymore from the healthy controls. Together with our previous reports indicating normalized sensori(motor) gating in the same patients following administration of clonidine, our results could be of potential high clinical relevance in treating schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on longer trial periods to investigate if clonidine also improves cognitive functioning in schizophrenia.

Impact of a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, on cortical excitability and electrophysiological properties of the brain in healthy volunteers: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0212689	The inflammatory response is considered a defence mechanism against physical or infectious insults and is prevalent within the central nervous system. Seizures also result in a robust inflammatory cascade, leading to enhanced activation of excitatory synaptic networks. Ample evidence based on animal models of epilepsy has demonstrated that celecoxib, a highly selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, has anticonvulsant effects. We aimed to evaluate the impact of celecoxib on the cortical excitability and electrophysiological properties of the brain in healthy humans. Electroencephalography (EEG) or transmagnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to measure neurophysiological activity. Forty healthy volunteers were randomized to 4 groups (n = 10 in each group): 1) celecoxib and EEG, 2) placebo and EEG, 3) celecoxib and TMS, and 4) placebo and TMS. For the EEG study, resting EEG was performed at baseline just before administering 400 mg of celecoxib or placebo and repeated 4 hours after administration. The subjects took 200 mg of celecoxib or placebo twice a day for 7 subsequent days, and a third EEG was conducted 4 hours after the final dose. Power spectra were compared at each time point. For the TMS study, the resting motor threshold (RMT), motor evoked potential (MEP) peak-to-peak amplitude, and cortical silent period (CSP) were measured at baseline and after taking 200 mg of celecoxib or placebo twice a day for 7 days. Celecoxib did not significantly change brain activity in the EEG study. However, the sum of power recorded from all electrodes tended to increase in the celecoxib group only at 4 hours after administration (p = 0.06). In detail, one dose of celecoxib (400 mg) transiently and significantly increased the alpha band power recorded in the frontal and parietal areas as well as in the whole brain (p = 0.049, 0.017, and 0.014, respectively) and the beta frequency in the central and parietal regions (p = 0.013 and 0.005, respectively), whereas the placebo did not. This effect was abolished after 7 days of treatment. In the TMS study, we found no statistically significant change in the RMT, MEP peak-to-peak amplitude or CSP. This evidence suggests that celecoxib transiently alters the electrophysiological properties of the brain but does not suppress neuronal excitability in healthy humans.

Noradrenaline Modulates Visual Perception and Late Visually Evoked Activity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2018.05.051	"An identical sensory stimulus may or may not be incorporated into perceptual experience, depending on the behavioral and cognitive state of the organism. What determines whether a sensory stimulus will be perceived? While different behavioral and cognitive states may share a similar profile of electrophysiology, metabolism, and early sensory responses, neuromodulation is often different and therefore may constitute a key mechanism enabling perceptual awareness. Specifically, noradrenaline improves sensory responses, correlates with orienting toward behaviorally relevant stimuli, and is markedly reduced during sleep, while experience is largely ""disconnected"" from external events. Despite correlative evidence hinting at a relationship between noradrenaline and perception, causal evidence remains absent. Here, we pharmacologically down- and upregulated noradrenaline signaling in healthy volunteers using clonidine and reboxetine in double-blind placebo-controlled experiments, testing the effects on perceptual abilities and visually evoked electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI responses. We found that detection sensitivity, discrimination accuracy, and subjective visibility change in accordance with noradrenaline (NE) levels, whereas decision bias (criterion) is not affected. Similarly, noradrenaline increases the consistency of EEG visually evoked potentials, while lower noradrenaline levels delay response components around 200 ms. Furthermore, blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI activations in high-order visual cortex selectively vary along with noradrenaline signaling. Taken together, these results point to noradrenaline as a key factor causally linking visual awareness to external world events. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

Different effects of propofol and dexmedetomidine sedation on electroencephalogram patterns: Wakefulness, moderate sedation, deep sedation and recovery.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199120	Sedation induces changes in electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics. However, the distinct EEG dynamic characteristics at comparable sedation levels have not been well studied, resulting in potential interpretation errors in EEG monitoring during sedation. We aimed to analyze the EEG dynamics of dexmedetomidine and propofol at comparable sedation levels and to explore EEG changes with increased sedation levels for each agent. We measured the Bispectral Index (BIS) and 20-channel EEG under dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation from wakefulness, moderate sedation, and deep sedation to recovery in healthy volunteers (n = 10) in a randomized, 2-day, crossover study. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. Despite similar changes in increased delta oscillations, multiple differences in the EEG spatiotemporal dynamics were observed between these two agents. During moderate sedation, both dexmedetomidine and propofol induced increased spindle power; however, dexmedetomidine decreased the global alpha/beta/gamma power, whereas propofol decreased the alpha power in the occipital area and increased the global spindle/beta/gamma power. During deep sedation, dexmedetomidine was associated with increased fronto-central spindle power and decreased global alpha/beta/gamma power, but propofol was associated with increased theta/alpha/spindle/beta power, which was maximized in the frontal area. The transition of topographic alpha/spindle/beta power distribution from moderate sedation to deep sedation completely differed between these two agents. Our study demonstrated that there was a distinct hierarchy of EEG changes with increased sedation depths by propofol and dexmedetomidine. Differences in EEG dynamics at the same sedation level might account for differences in the BIS value and reflect the different sedation mechanisms. EEG-based clinical sedation monitoring should consider the effect of drug types on EEG dynamics.

Functional Characterization of At-Level Hypersensitivity in Patients With Spinal Cord Injury.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpain.2016.10.003	At-level and above-level hypersensitivity was assessed in patients with chronic complete thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI). Patients were classified using somatosensory mapping (brush, cold, pinprick) and assigned into 2 groups (ie, patients with at-level hypersensitivity [SCIHs, n = 8] and without at-level hypersensitivity [SCINHs, n = 7]). Gender and age-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Quantitative sensory testing (QST), electrically- and histamine-induced pain and itch, laser Doppler imaging, and laser-evoked potentials (LEP) were recorded at-level and above-level in SCI-patients. Six of 8 SCIHs, but 0 of 7 SCINHs patients suffered from neuropathic below-level pain. Clinical sensory mapping revealed spreading of hypersensitivity to more cranial areas (above-level) in 3 SCIHs. Cold pain threshold measures confirmed clinical hypersensitivity at-level in SCIHs. At-level and above-level hypersensitivity to electrical stimulation did not differ significantly between SCIHs and SCINHs. Mechanical allodynia, cold, and pin-prick hypersensitivity did not relate to impaired sensory function (QST), axon reflex flare, or LEPs. Clinically assessed at-level hypersensitivity was linked to below-level neuropathic pain, suggesting neuronal hyperexcitability contributes to the development of neuropathic pain. However, electrically evoked pain was not significantly different between SCI patients. Thus, SCI-induced enhanced excitability of nociceptive processing does not necessarily lead to neuropathic pain. QST and LEP revealed no crucial role of deafferentation for hypersensitivity development after SCI.

Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Dexmedetomidine-Induced Electroencephalogram Oscillations.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0163431	An improved understanding of the neural correlates of altered arousal states is fundamental for precise brain state targeting in clinical settings. More specifically, electroencephalogram recordings are now increasingly being used to relate drug-specific oscillatory dynamics to clinically desired altered arousal states. Dexmedetomidine is an anesthetic adjunct typically administered in operating rooms and intensive care units to produce and maintain a sedative brain state. However, a high-density electroencephalogram characterization of the neural correlates of the dexmedetomidine-induced altered arousal state has not been previously accomplished. Therefore, we administered dexmedetomidine (1mcg/kg bolus over 10 minutes, followed by 0.7mcg/kg/hr over 50 minutes) and recorded high-density electroencephalogram signals in healthy volunteers, 18-36 years old (n = 8). We analyzed the data with multitaper spectral and global coherence methods. We found that dexmedetomidine was associated with increased slow-delta oscillations across the entire scalp, increased theta oscillations in occipital regions, increased spindle oscillations in frontal regions, and decreased beta oscillations across the entire scalp. The theta and spindle oscillations were globally coherent. During recovery from this state, these electroencephalogram signatures reverted towards baseline signatures. We report that dexmedetomidine-induced electroencephalogram signatures more closely approximate the human sleep onset process than previously appreciated. We suggest that these signatures may be targeted by real time visualization of the electroencephalogram or spectrogram in clinical settings. Additionally, these signatures may aid the development of control systems for principled neurophysiological based brain-state targeting.

Noradrenergic and cholinergic modulation of late ERP responses to deviant stimuli.	DOI: 10.1111/psyp.12544	Researchers have proposed several hypotheses about the neuromodulator systems involved in generating P3 components of the ERP. To test some of these hypotheses, we conducted a randomized placebo-controlled crossover study in which we investigated how the late positive ERP response to deviant stimuli is modulated by (a) clonidine, an α2 agonist that attenuates baseline noradrenergic activity; and (b) scopolamine, a muscarinic antagonist of acetylcholine receptors. We collected EEG data from 18 healthy volunteers during the performance of an auditory oddball task with several active and passive task conditions. We then used temporospatial principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose the ERP waveforms. The PCA revealed two distinct late positive ERP components: the classic parietal P300 and the frontal novelty P3. Statistical analysis of the temporospatial factor scores indicated that in most conditions the amplitude of the classic P300 was increased by clonidine and scopolamine. In contrast, the amplitude of the novelty P3 was decreased by both drugs. The similar pattern of results for clonidine and scopolamine probably reflects the strong interactions between the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems. The results, in combination with previous pharmacological studies, suggest a critical role for both neuromodulator systems in the generation of the P300 and the novelty P3.

Electroencephalogram reactivity to verbal command after dexmedetomidine, propofol and sevoflurane-induced unresponsiveness.	DOI: 10.1111/anae.12868	Although electroencephalogram reactivity (i.e. transient changes in electrical brain activity following external stimulus) might be useful in depth-of-anaesthesia monitoring, it has not been systematically examined with different anaesthetics at doses titrated to unresponsiveness. Three 10-subject groups of healthy volunteers received dexmedetomidine, propofol or sevoflurane in escalating pseudo-steady-state concentrations at 10-min intervals until they did not open their eyes to command. The electroencephalogram was continuously recorded and spectral variables were calculated with short-time Fourier transform and time-varying autoregressive modelling. Electroencephalogram reactivity was most prominent in the midfrontal derivations (termed F3 and F4). During drug-induced unresponsiveness, electroencephalogram reactivity was still present in all drug groups. Dexmedetomidine, propofol and sevoflurane induced distinct suppression patterns on the electroencephalogram reactivity at the same clinical endpoint (unresponsiveness). Reactivity was best maintained with propofol, while only minimally preserved with dexmedetomidine and sevoflurane. Thus, it may be difficult to harness reactivity for depth-of-anaesthesia monitoring.

The effects of the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor vardenafil on cognitive performance in healthy adults: a behavioral-electroencephalography study.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881113477747	Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) improve cognitive performance of rodents, but the few human studies investigating their effects did not systematically investigate cognitive effects and the results have been quite contradictory. Therefore, we examined whether the PDE5-I vardenafil improves memory and executive functioning and affect electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy young adults. Participants were selected out of a group of volunteers, based on their performance on a memory screening and they were orally treated with vardenafil (10-20 mg or placebo). Memory and executive functioning were tested while EEG activity was recorded. Additionally, a simple reaction time task and questionnaires addressing various complaints were presented. No prominent effects of vardenafil on cognition were found: participants only made more mistakes on a reaction time task after 20 mg vardenafil. During encoding of words, the P300 was generally smaller after vardenafil treatment. Furthermore, the N400 was larger after vardenafil 10 mg than placebo treatment in a spatial memory task at Fz. Finally, headache and feeling weak were reported more after vardenafil treatment. Vardenafil did not affect cognitive performance of healthy adults and showed only some incidental effects on ERPs. These findings in humans do not corroborate the cognition-enhancing effects of PDE5-Is in healthy animals.

Differential effects of a dual orexin receptor antagonist (SB-649868) and zolpidem on sleep initiation and consolidation, SWS, REM sleep, and EEG power spectra in a model of situational insomnia.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2011.310	Orexins have a role in sleep regulation, and orexin receptor antagonists are under development for the treatment of insomnia. We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period crossover study to investigate the effect of single doses of the dual orexin receptor antagonist SB-649868 (10 or 30 mg) and a positive control zolpidem (10 mg), an allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors. Objective and subjective sleep parameters and next-day performance were assessed in 51 healthy male volunteers in a traffic noise model of situational insomnia. Compared with placebo, SB-649868 10 and 30 mg increased total sleep time (TST) by 17 and 31 min (p<0.001), whereas after zolpidem TST was increased by 11.0 min (p=0.012). Wake after sleep onset was reduced significantly by 14.7 min for the SB-6489698 30 mg dose (p<0.001). Latency to persistent sleep was significantly reduced after both doses of SB-6489698 (p=0.003), but not after zolpidem. Slow wave sleep (SWS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra in non-REM sleep were not affected by either dose of SB-640868, whereas SWS (p< 0.001) and low delta activity (<=1.0 Hz) were increased, and 2.25-11.0 Hz activity decreased after zolpidem. REM sleep duration was increased after SB-649868 30 mg (p=0.002) and reduced after zolpidem (p=0.049). Latency to REM sleep was reduced by 20.1 (p=0.034) and 34.0 min (p<0.001) after 10 and 30 mg of SB-649868. Sleep-onset REM episodes were observed. SB-649868 was well tolerated. This dual orexin receptor antagonist exerts hypnotic activity, with effects on sleep structure and the EEG that are different from those of zolpidem.

Effect of vicriviroc on the QT/corrected QT interval and central nervous system in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1128/AAC.01447-09	Vicriviroc is a CCR5 antagonist in clinical development for the treatment of HIV-1. Two phase I studies were conducted to assess the safety of vicriviroc. One study characterized the drug's potential to prolong the QT/corrected QT (QTc) interval and to induce arrhythmia. In this partially blind, parallel-group study, 200 healthy subjects aged 18 to 50 years were randomized in equal groups to the following regimens: (i) placebo for 9 days and a single dose of moxifloxacin at 400 mg on day 10, (ii) placebo, (iii) vicriviroc-ritonavir (30 and 100 mg), (iv) vicriviroc-ritonavir (150 and 100 mg), and (v) ritonavir (100 mg). The second study characterized the effects of a range of vicriviroc doses on the central nervous system (CNS). In this third-party-blind, parallel-group study, 30 healthy subjects aged 18 to 48 years were randomized to receive a single dose of either vicriviroc at 200, 250, or 300 mg or placebo, followed by multiple (seven) once-daily doses of either vicriviroc at 150, 200, or 250 mg or placebo, respectively. In the first study, vicriviroc produced no clinically meaningful effect on the QT/QTc interval when administered at a supratherapeutic or therapeutic dose concurrently with ritonavir. In the second study, vicriviroc produced no observable seizure activity, nor was it held to be associated with any clinically relevant changes in brain waveforms in the final consensus of reviewers. These findings showed that vicriviroc produced no clinically relevant QTc prolongation cardiac or epileptogenic effects in healthy individuals at exposures as high as five times those expected for HIV-infected patients receiving therapeutic doses of vicriviroc in a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor-containing regimen.

Nelotanserin, a novel selective human 5-hydroxytryptamine2A inverse agonist for the treatment of insomnia.	DOI: 10.1124/jpet.109.160994	5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2A) receptor inverse agonists are promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnias. Among these agents is nelotanserin, a potent, selective 5-HT(2A) inverse agonist. Both radioligand binding and functional inositol phosphate accumulation assays suggest that nelotanserin has low nanomolar potency on the 5-HT(2A) receptor with at least 30- and 5000-fold selectivity compared with 5-HT(2C) and 5-HT(2B) receptors, respectively. Nelotanserin dosed orally prevented (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI; 5-HT(2A) agonist)-induced hypolocomotion, increased sleep consolidation, and increased total nonrapid eye movement sleep time and deep sleep, the latter marked by increases in electroencephalogram (EEG) delta power. These effects on rat sleep were maintained after repeated subchronic dosing. In healthy human volunteers, nelotanserin was rapidly absorbed after oral administration and achieved maximum concentrations 1 h later. EEG effects occurred within 2 to 4 h after dosing, and were consistent with vigilance-lowering. A dose response of nelotanserin was assessed in a postnap insomnia model in healthy subjects. All doses (up to 40 mg) of nelotanserin significantly improved measures of sleep consolidation, including decreases in the number of stage shifts, number of awakenings after sleep onset, microarousal index, and number of sleep bouts, concomitant with increases in sleep bout duration. Nelotanserin did not affect total sleep time, or sleep onset latency. Furthermore, subjective pharmacodynamic effects observed the morning after dosing were minimal and had no functional consequences on psychomotor skills or memory. These studies point to an efficacy and safety profile for nelotanserin that might be ideally suited for the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnias.

DOI: 10.2344/0003-3006-55.3.82	This study investigated the physiologic and sedative parameters associated with a low-dose infusion of dexmedetomidine (Dex). Thirteen healthy volunteers were sedated with Dex at a loading dose of 6 mcg/kg/h for 5 minutes and a continuous infusion dose of 0.2 mcg/kg/h for 25 minutes. The recovery process was observed for 60 minutes post infusion. The tidal volume decreased significantly despite nonsignificant changes in respiratory rate, minute ventilation, oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide. The mean arterial pressure and heart rate also decreased significantly but within clinically acceptable levels. Amnesia to pin prick was present in 69% of subjects. A Trieger dot test plot error ratio did not show a significant change at 30 minutes post infusion despite a continued significant decrease in bispectral index.

Single dose of a dopamine agonist impairs reinforcement learning in humans: evidence from event-related potentials and computational modeling of striatal-cortical function.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.20642	Animal findings have highlighted the modulatory role of phasic dopamine (DA) signaling in incentive learning, particularly in the acquisition of reward-related behavior. In humans, these processes remain largely unknown. In a recent study, we demonstrated that a single low dose of a D2/D3 agonist (pramipexole)-assumed to activate DA autoreceptors and thus reduce phasic DA bursts-impaired reward learning in healthy subjects performing a probabilistic reward task. The purpose of this study was to extend these behavioral findings using event-related potentials and computational modeling. Compared with the placebo group, participants receiving pramipexole showed increased feedback-related negativity to probabilistic rewards and decreased activation in dorsal anterior cingulate regions previously implicated in integrating reinforcement history over time. Additionally, findings of blunted reward learning in participants receiving pramipexole were simulated by reduced presynaptic DA signaling in response to reward in a neural network model of striatal-cortical function. These preliminary findings offer important insights on the role of phasic DA signals on reinforcement learning in humans and provide initial evidence regarding the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain mechanisms underlying these processes.

The test persons were assigned either to a drug (n = 20) or a placebo group (n = 20). The CNV was recorded three times: before, directly after, and 24 h after drug or placebo intake. The CNV paradigm was presented in a standard, a cued and a choice version. Rizatriptan led to an increase of CNV amplitude that depended on the level of difficulty of the task. Whereas there was no drug effect in the standard version, an amplitude increase was obtained mainly in the choice task. The results are in line with the ceiling theory of migraine, which assumes a rise of CNV amplitude if the serotonin level is lowered.

Role of histaminergic neurons in hypnotic modulation of brain processing of visceral perception.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2007.00959.x	Modulating visceral sensation of the body is important to the understanding of emotion formation. Molecules that act during hypnosis and modify visceral pain perception are not known. We tested our hypothesis that hypnotic suggestion changes electrophysiological processing of visceroafferent signals in the human brain and that these conditions are in part dependent on histaminergic neurons. Twelve healthy male subjects were studied on two separate days: a day of treatment with histamine H1 receptor antagonist (d-chlorpheniramine 100 microg kg(-1), intravenously) and another day of that with placebo (saline, the same amount) in a randomized order. We recorded cortical evoked potentials to 100 rectal electrical stimuli after neutral, hyperalgesic or analgesic hypnotic suggestions as given to modulate the visceral perception. Analgesic suggestion reduced the amplitude of the deepest positive peak of viscerosensory evoked potential. Administration of histamine H1 antagonist diminished the attenuation of viscerosensory evoked potential by analgesic suggestion. Our results suggest that central pain modulatory system in the brain is activated by hypnotic suggestion and that brain histamine is a mediator in the hypnotic modulation of visceral sensory pathway as well as in the control of consciousness level. These findings lead us to possible new treatment for control of visceral perception.

Assessing the depth of dexmedetomidine-induced sedation with electroencephalogram (EEG)-based spectral entropy.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1399-6576.2006.01174.x	Adequate sedation of critically ill patients improves the outcome of intensive care. Maintaining an optimal level of sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU) is difficult because of a lack of appropriate monitoring methods to guide drug dosing. Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, has recently been introduced for the sedation of ICU patients. This study investigated the utility of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based spectral entropy monitoring (with M-ENTROPY, GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) for the assessment of dexmedetomidine-induced sedation.

The effects of dexmedetomidine/remifentanil and midazolam/remifentanil on auditory-evoked potentials and electroencephalogram at light-to-moderate sedation levels in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1213/01.ane.0000237394.21087.85	Avoidance of excessively deep sedation levels is problematic in intensive care patients. Electrophysiologic monitoring may offer an approach to solving this problem. Since electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to different sedation regimens vary, we assessed electrophysiologic responses to two sedative drug regimens in 10 healthy volunteers. Dexmedetomidine/remifentanil (dex/remi group) and midazolam/remifentanil (mida/remi group) were infused 7 days apart. Each combination of medications was given at stepwise intervals to reach Ramsay scores (RS) 2, 3, and 4. Resting EEG, bispectral index (BIS), and the N100 amplitudes of long-latency auditory-evoked potentials (ERP) were recorded at each level of sedation. During dex/remi, resting EEG was characterized by a recurrent high-power low-frequency pattern which became more pronounced at deeper levels of sedation. BIS Index decreased uniformly in only the dex/remi group (from 94 +/- 3 at baseline to 58 +/- 14 at RS 4) compared to the mida/remi group (from 94 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 10; P = 0.029 between groups). The ERP amplitudes decreased from 5.3 +/- 1.3 at baseline to 0.4 +/- 1.1 at RS 4 (P = 0.003) in only the mida/remi group. We conclude that ERPs in volunteers sedated with dex/remi, in contrast to mida/remi, indicate a cortical response to acoustic stimuli, even when sedation reaches deeper levels. Consequently, ERP can monitor sedation with midazolam but not with dexmedetomidine. The reverse is true for BIS.

Clonidine effects on pain evoked SII activity in humans.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ejpain.2005.12.003	We investigated pain evoked activity in the human secondary sensory cortex (SII) following clonidine administration in six healthy volunteers using multi-channel magnetoencephalography (MEG). Pain was elicited by electrical shocks applied intracutaneously to the fingertip. Subjects rated pain intensity and perceptions of tiredness and passiveness by numerical ranking scales. Each subject underwent two investigations, one week apart from each other, with clonidine doses of 1.5 or 3.0microg/kg, administered intravenously in a random order and double-blinded. We applied a total number of seven blocks, each consisting of 60 painful stimuli, with one adaptation block, one pre-medication block, four post-medication blocks and one recovery block at the end of the session. MEG data were analysed by dipole reconstruction using CURRY(R) (Neuroscan, Hamburg) software package. Cortical activity in the contralateral SII cortex appeared with peak latencies of 118.5+/-10ms. This activity was significantly reduced by clonidine, in parallel with a reduction of pain intensity and enhancement of subjective tiredness and passiveness. There was, however, no significant correlation between MEG and subjective effects. Although both clonidine doses had similar effects, the higher dose induced longer changes. Results indicate that intravenous clonidine is able to relieve pain, but the exact mechanism of clonidine at the level of the SII cortex remains unclear. It is possible that clonidine interacts with the brainstem ascending system regulating vigilance and arousal which would explain the observed decrement of pain induced activity in SII. An additional more specific analgesic action at spinal level cannot be excluded.

The effects of clomethiazole on polysomnographically recorded sleep in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1007/s00406-005-0589-3	Clomethiazole is widely used in European countries to treat alcohol withdrawal symptoms including delirium tremens. The current study aimed to explore the effects of clomethiazole on the sleep of healthy volunteers. We postulated both a hypnotic and a REM suppressive effect as well as the occurrence of a rebound phenomenon following three days of treatment with clomethiazole. The study group was composed of five men and five women. The probands were examined in the sleep laboratory throughout a course of seven nights. The first night was considered as the adaptation night and the second as the baseline night. Prior to nights 3 to 5, probands took 384 mg clomethiazole at 22 hours. The 6th and 7th nights served to record potential effects of medication discontinuation. The current study confirms the indication in the scientific literature with regard to hypnotic and REM-suppressive effects of clomethiazole, as well as a rebound phenomenon following discontinuation of the medication. The effect of clomethiazole on the sleep EEG was most obvious in the first half of the night. The analysis of the polysomnogram in terms of each half of the night gave no indication of a rebound phenomenon during the second half. The REM sleep-suppressing component of clomethiazole is of great interest in connection with its use in treating delirium tremens. The rebound phenomenon in healthy controls after only three days of medication at a relatively low dosage of clomethiazole underscores the need to administer it in doses individually tailored to the extent of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in the individual patient.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and sleep in posttraumatic stress disorder.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1300676	Alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sleep disturbances have been described separately in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is not known if HPA alterations and sleep disturbances are associated in PTSD. This study examined sleep and HPA activity in 20 male medication-free subjects with PTSD and 16 matched healthy controls. Two nights of polysomnography were obtained and 24-h urinary cortisol was collected during day 2. Subjects self-administered a low-dose (0.5 mg) salivary dexamethasone test at home. Compared with controls, PTSD subjects had higher 24-h urinary microg cortisol/g creatinine (mean+/-SD 40+/-17 vs 28+/-12, p=0.03) but not significantly higher 24-h urinary cortisol (mean+/-SD 52+/-15 microg/day vs 43+/-23, p=0.19). PTSD subjects showed a trend towards less cortisol suppression after dexamethasone (73%+/-18 vs 83%+/-10, p=0.06). In the combined sample, delta sleep was significantly and negatively correlated with 24-h urinary cortisol (r=-0.36, p=0.04), and with 24-h urinary cortisol/g creatinine on a trend level (r=-0.34, p=0.06). Our results suggest that increased cortisol is negatively associated with delta sleep. This may contribute to sleep abnormalities in conditions associated with elevated cortisol, possibly including PTSD. Future studies should explore the temporal relationship between HPA activity, sleep disturbances, and psychopathology after a traumatic event.

CNS effects of sumatriptan and rizatriptan in healthy female volunteers.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1468-2982.2002.00344.x	This study investigates the CNS effects of sumatriptan and rizatriptan, with temazepam as an active comparator, in healthy female volunteers. Sixteen volunteers completed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study and on four separate occasions received either 100 mg sumatriptan, 20 mg rizatriptan or 20 mg temazepam. The main parameters were eye movements, EEG, body sway, visual analogue scales and a cognitive test battery. Rizatriptan and sumatriptan decreased saccadic peak velocity by 18.3 (95% CI: 5.7, 30.8) and 15.0 (2.2, 27.9) degrees/sec, respectively, about half the decrease induced by temazepam (35.0 (22.1, 47.8) degrees/sec). Body sway increased (30% for rizatriptan (16%, 45%) and 14% for sumatriptan (1%, 27%), respectively). Temazepam caused larger, similar effects. In contrast to temazepam, sumatriptan and rizatriptan decreased reaction times of recognition tasks and increased EEG alpha power (significant for sumatriptan, 0.477 (0.02, 0.935). Therapeutic doses of sumatriptan and rizatriptan caused CNS effects indicative of mild sedation. For EEG and recognition reaction times the effects were opposite to temazepam, indicating central stimulation.

Sedative, amnestic, and analgesic properties of small-dose dexmedetomidine infusions.	DOI: 10.1097/00000539-200003000-00035	This research determined the safety and efficacy of two small-dose infusions of dexmedetomidine by evaluating sedation, analgesia, cognition, and cardiorespiratory function. Seven healthy young volunteers provided informed consent and participated on three occasions with random assignment to drug or placebo. Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, ETCO(2), O(2) saturation, and processed electroencephalogram (bispectral analysis) were monitored. Baseline hemodynamic measurements were acquired, and psychometric tests were performed (visual analog scale for sedation; observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale; digit symbol substitution test; and memory). The pain from a 1-min cold pressor test was quantified with a visual analog scale. After a 10-min initial dose of saline or 6 microg. kg(-1). h(-1) dexmedetomidine, volunteers received 50-min IV infusions of saline, or 0.2 or 0.6 microg. kg(-1). h(-1) dexmedetomidine. Measurements were repeated at the end of infusion and during recovery. The two dexmedetomidine infusions resulted in similar and significant sedation (30%-60%), impairment of memory (approximately 50%), and psychomotor performance (28%-41%). Hemodynamics, oxygen saturation, ETCO(2), and respiratory rate were well preserved throughout the infusion and recovery periods. Pain to the cold pressor test was reduced by 30% during dexmedetomidine infusion. Small-dose dexmedetomidine provided sedation, analgesia, and memory and cognitive impairment. These properties might prove useful in a postoperative or intensive care unit setting. IMPLICATIPNS: The alpha(2) agonist, dexmedetomidine, has sedation and analgesic properties. This study quantified these effects, as well as cardiorespiratory, memory and psychomotor effects, in healthy volunteers. Dexmedetomidine infusions resulted in reversible sedation, mild analgesia, and memory impairment without cardiorespiratory compromise.

Clinical pharmacology of befloxatone: a brief review.	DOI: 10.1016/s0165-0327(98)00226-2	Clinical pharmacology studies of befloxatone, a new selective reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), have addressed safety, with special emphasis on tyramine interactions, and have also investigated pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics in terms of both MAO-A inhibition (using 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, DHPG, as a pharmacological activity marker) and effects on psychomotor and cognitive function, in young and elderly healthy volunteers. Clinical and laboratory safety data were satisfactory in healthy volunteers given single doses of up to 160 mg or repeated doses of up to 80 mg/day for 7 days. Tyramine interaction studies showed that the expected potentiation of the tyramine pressor effect occurred with a safety margin that was so wide as to make dietary restrictions unnecessary with dosages of up to 20 mg once daily in clinical settings. Absorption was rapid (tmax = 2 h), terminal halflife was about 11 h, and PK parameters increased linearly with the dose. Befloxatone induced a dose-dependent decrease in plasma DHPG levels from 2.5 mg upwards, and a 10-mg dose provided sub-maximal activity (80% DHPG decrease) of 24 h duration. No sedative or stimulant effects were detected using several batteries of psychometric tests. Befloxatone was devoid of deleterious effects on memory in young volunteers, and exhibited the EEG profile of a non-sedative antidepressant. In summary, available clinical pharmacology studies confirm that befloxatone is a safe and potent RIMA with no potential for inducing deleterious CNS effects.

Effects of zolmitriptan (Zomig) on central serotonergic neurotransmission as assessed by active oddball auditory event-related potentials in volunteers without migraine.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1468-2982.1999.019002100.x	In this randomized, double-blind, three-period crossover trial, 24 healthy volunteers without migraine received zolmitriptan 5 mg, dexfenfluramine 15 mg or placebo orally. At 2, 6, and 24 h postdose, auditory stimuli of 1000 Hz (nontarget tone) and 2000 Hz (target tone) were randomly and binaurally presented in an active oddball paradigm (4:1 ratio). Cortical auditory evoked responses were recorded for 500 msec poststimulus. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan and a 17-lead quantitative EEG were assessed at the same timepoints. Relative to placebo, zolmitriptan reduced the maximum absolute amplitude, amplitude difference (from nontarget tone noise) and area under the curve of the cortical auditory target tone event-related potential (P300 ERP). The most dramatic effect of zolmitriptan was to diminish the point estimate of noise during the 200-400 msec poststimulus epoch. The effect of zolmitriptan appeared concentration dependent. The latency of the P300 ERP was unaffected by zolmitriptan and there was no clinically significant effect on the EEG. Modification by zolmitriptan of the cortical electrical activity evoked by auditory stimuli confirms a central action of this drug in humans, which appears to affect cortical information processing without global alteration of the quantitative EEG.

Intensive and sustained air operations: potential use of the stimulant, pemoline.		Intensive and sustained military operations involve long periods of overnight work and the occasional use of a stimulant to maintain performance may be beneficial.

Effects of pemoline on spontaneous and event-related electrical activity of the brain.	DOI: 10.1159/000026496	The effect of pemoline on the electrical activity of the brain (electroencephalogram, EEG) was studied in relation to time since sleep and time of day in 6 healthy subjects carrying out periods of work lasting 18 h. Power of the spontaneous EEG increased with time since sleep and amplitude of the P3 event-related response decreased. The changes may be interpreted as the reduction in alertness with time awake. In contrast, pemoline decreased power of the spontaneous EEG and increased the amplitude the P3 response, effects that are consistent with improved alertness. The changes in brain activity were paralleled by effects on performance, in terms of percentage of correct responses and reaction time. Performance decreased with time awake, and was improved by pemoline compared with placebo. The drug counteracted the adverse effects of time since sleep, with the beneficial effect of the drug persisting over the 18-hour period of work. The findings emphasise that spontaneous and event-related activity of the EEG may be used both to complement measures of performance in the laboratory and to assess behaviour in occupational situations where performance testing is impractical.

Quantitative topographical electroencephalographic analysis after intravenous clonidine in healthy male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1097/00000539-199801000-00039	We used quantitative topographical electroencephalography (EEG) to determine the time course of changes in brain electrical activity after clonidine infusion. Twenty healthy male volunteers (aged 24 +/- 5 yr) were included in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (Group 1, placebo, n = 10; Group 2, 2.0 micrograms/kg clonidine, n = 10) study. EEG (17 electrodes, common average reference, fast Fourier transformation, band pass 0.4-35.0 Hz) output was recorded until 145 min after drug infusion. Subjects were intermittently stimulated by verbal commands. Clonidine-related changes resulted in attenuation of the physiological alpha fluctuations seen in untreated subjects and were most pronounced at parietooccipital (P4, O2) recording sites. This was associated with initial maximal increases in slow wave activity (delta) almost uniformly distributed over the whole cortex, restricting with time to occipital regions (O2). The EEG mapping technique may provide more specific information about clonidine-mediated sedative effects, indicating facilitations of EEG patterns that are not homogeneously distributed. These EEG changes cannot be explained by physiologic changes in vigilance or by normal sleep stages because they were not observed after placebo. EEG effects seem to be unrelated to changes in hemodynamics.

Beneficial effect of renal transplantation on cognitive brain function.	DOI: 10.1038/ki.1996.115	Cognitive brain dysfunction is a common complication of end-stage renal disease. To investigate the cerebral effect of renal transplantation, we studied P300 event-related potentials--an objective marker of cognitive brain function--trailmaking test and Mini-mental state in 15 chronic hemodialysis patients and 45 matched healthy subjects. Before transplantation, patients showed prolonged P300 latency (364 vs. 337 ms, P < 0.01), smaller amplitude (15.2 vs. 19.1 microV) and scored lower (P < 0.05) in trailmaking test and Mini-mental state as compared to healthy subjects. Following renal transplantation (14 months), P300 latency decreased (337 ms, P < 0.01 vs. before) and amplitude increased (17.4 microV, P < 0.05 vs. before), indicating improved cognitive brain function. The trailmaking test and Mini-mental state tended to improve. Following transplantation, P300 findings, trailmaking test and Mini-mental state were not different from healthy subjects. Additional studies following erythropoietin treatment in 6 of the 15 hemodialysis patients revealed decreased (improved) P300 latency (351 vs. 379 ms before, P < 0.05) with further decrease following transplantation (341 ms, P = 0.06). Our findings indicate that cognitive brain dysfunction in hemodialysis patients may be fully reversed by successful renal transplantation.

Pharmacoelectroencephalographic profile of befloxatone, a new reversible MAO-A inhibitor, in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1159/000119299	The pharmaco-EEG profile and the effects on P300 and CNV of befloxatone, a new selective and reversible MAO-A inhibitor, were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover study. Twelve healthy young male volunteers were administered single doses of 2.5, 10 and 20 mg befloxatone and placebo separated by a 1-week washout. The EEG data were recorded before and at least 6 h after drug administration, by means of 28 leads allowing topographical analysis of the results. MAO inhibition, subjective effects and safety variables were also investigated. Statistical analysis was performed by means of the SDT method. Befloxatone induced dose-related EEG changes which occurred rapidly, peaked between 0.5 and 2 h and lasted at least until 6 h after drug administration. The EEG changes were characterized by an increase in absolute and/or relative alpha power, mainly alpha 1, after the 3 doses and a theta power increase after 10 and 20 mg only. These changes occurred mainly over the centroparietotemporal areas. Concerning the event-related potential, P300 latency of the auditory evoked potentials did not change. The P300 and CNV mean topographic amplitudes were decreased, between 0.5 and 2 h, after the two lowest doses for the P300 and the 3 doses for the CNV. After administration of 2.5, 10 and 20 mg, MAO inhibitions was shown by respectively 38, 76 and 81% reduction in plasma free 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylglycol reached after 2-4 h. Such a pharmaco-EEG profile, occurring at doses inducing MAO-A inhibition, is similar to those already described with nonsedative antidepressants.

Effects of the novel neuroprotective agent, riluzole, on human brain function and behavior: II. Double-blind, placebo-controlled EEG mapping and psychometric studies under hypoxia.		In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the antihypoxidotic properties of the novel neuroprotective agent, riluzole, were investigated utilizing blood gas analysis, EEG mapping and psychometry under a transient, reversible, hypoxic hypoxidosis. The latter was induced by a fixed gas combination of 9.8% oxygen (O2) and 90.2% nitrogen (N2) (found at 6000 m altitude), which was inhaled for 23 min under normobaric conditions by 20 healthy, young volunteers. They randomly received, after an adaptation session, single oral doses of placebo, and 50, 100 and 200 mg riluzole. Evaluation of blood gases, EEG mapping and psychometry were carried out 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h postdrug, each time under the 23-min hypoxia. Blood gas analysis demonstrated a drop in PO2 from 106 to 37 and 36 mmHg, in PCO2 from 35 to 31 and 31 mmHg at 14 and 23 min of inhalation, respectively, while pH increased from 7.43 to 7.48 and 7.48. Base excess and standard bicarbonate remained stable. EEG mapping exhibited under hypoxia a marked increase of delta/theta, decrease of alpha and an increase of superimposed beta activity, as well as a slowing of the centroid of the total activity, which reflects deterioration of vigilance. Riluzole in lower doses and at early hours after higher doses did not attenuate this hypoxia-induced vigilance decrement, while with higher doses (100-200 mg) in later recording periods (6-8 h) brain protection occurred. As compared with placebo, delta/theta power increased at 2-8 h after 50 mg riluzole and up to 4 h after 100 mg riluzole, while a decrease occurred at 4 and 8 h after 100 mg and at 6-8 h after 200 mg. Alpha power showed no changes after 50 mg, an increase at 2 and 8 h after 100 mg and a decrease at 4 h after 200 mg, with no changes thereafter. Beta power decreased at various times after all three doses. At the behavioral level, hypoxic hypoxidosis induced a deterioration of the noopsyche, which was not mitigated by riluzole. In regard to the thymopsyche, there was even a slight deterioration after all three doses, as compared with placebo.

Effects of the novel neuroprotective agent, riluzole, on human brain function and behavior: I. Double-blind, placebo-controlled EEG mapping and psychometric studies under normoxia.		In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, the encephalotropic and psychotropic properties of single oral doses of the novel neuroprotective agent, riluzole, were investigated utilizing EEG mapping and psychometry. Twenty healthy young volunteers received randomly at weekly intervals, placebo, 50, 100 and 200 mg riluzole. EEG recordings and evaluation of 9 noopsychic and 5 thymopsychic variables were carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after oral drug administration. EEG maps on the multivariate analysis demonstrated that all three doses induced significant changes in human brain function, as compared with placebo, between 2 and 8 h, with effect only increasing slightly with dose. EEG maps on univariate analysis demonstrated generally an increase of delta/theta, decrease of alpha and beta power, as well as a slowing of the centroid of the total power spectrum, which suggests sedative properties of the drug. Only after the two highest doses at 6 h were some different findings observed. Multivariate statistics on psychometry failed to show any significant effects on the noopsyche, while for the thymopsyche, all three doses of riluzole produced a deterioration. The latter was characterized by a decrease in drive and wakefulness as well as deterioration in well-being, mood and affectivity. Thus, under normoxia, in all three doses riluzole produced neurophysiologically a sedative effect, accompanied at the behavioral level by a deterioration in the thymopsyche, which may be expected from a drug with antiglutamatergic effects in normals.

Do the B-vitamins exhibit antinociceptive efficacy in men? Results of a placebo-controlled repeated-measures double-blind study.	DOI: 10.1159/000119186	Additive analgesic effects of long-term application of a combination of the vitamins B1, B6, B12 (thiamine diphosphate 100 mg, pyridoxsine-HCl 200 mg, cyanocobalamin 20 micrograms, p.o.) on a single dose of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac (diclofenac-Na, 50 mg, p.o.) were investigated with a noninflammatory experimental pain model in 38 healthy volunteers. B-vitamins were given with 3 dosages/day for 1 week. Then experimental sessions of 3 h followed to test the analgesic efficacy of the NSAID. In these sessions, phasic pain was induced by intracutaneously applied brief electrical pulses (20 ms). Measured were the pain ratings, the cerebral potentials and the EEG delta power in responses to the stimuli as target variables for the analgesic test. Unspecific effects upon the vigilance system were evaluated by spontaneous EEG, auditory-evoked potentials and reaction times. The investigation was performed as a placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study. Blood samples were taken to monitor the plasma concentrations of the active agents. Whereas in the first block of stimuli (40-60 min after diclofenac medication) no analgesic effects of diclofenac could be observed, either given alone or after pretreatment with the B-vitamins, in the second stimulus block (100-120 min after medication) significant effects appeared in all target variables describing analgesia. Pain ratings were decreased by about 5%, late cerebral potentials by about 9% and stimulus-induced delta power of the EEG by about 14%. These effects were significant (p < 0.05, p < 0.01) against those under placebo, but came out to be independent of the B-vitamin pretreatment. No B-vitamin effects of the B-vitamins could be detected, either additive analgesic effects on diclofenac analgesia or on the concomitant variables describing unspecific sedative effects. Clearly the B-vitamin pretreatment for 1 week enlarged the plasma levels for vitamin B6 by 700%, for vitamin B1 by 70% and for vitamin B12 by 50%. All B-vitamin concentrations were independent of each other.

A comparison of two formulations for etomidate, 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) and propylene glycol.	DOI: 10.1213/00000539-199411000-00020	The unphysiologic osmolality of commercial preparations of etomidate dissolved in propylene glycol has limited its use as a drug to induce anesthesia. We wanted to determine whether hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) is a more suitable solvent than propylene glycol by comparing pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and side effects of etomidate preparations in each solvent. Twenty-four healthy, male volunteers, randomly assigned to either the male volunteers, randomly assigned to either the HPCD or the propylene glycol group received etomidate, 0.3 mg/kg, dissolved in one of the two test solvents. We recorded arterial blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, pain on injection, myoclonic movements, and venous sequelae. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were similar in both groups. Frequency and severity of pain on injection differed significantly between groups. In the propylene glycol group, five subjects suffered venous sequelae: in three, thrombophlebitis resolved after 5 days; in one, after 10 days; and in the other, after 12 days. In the HPCD group, only one subject suffered severe pain on injection and none had venous sequelae. We conclude that HPCD may be superior to propylene glycol as a solvent for etomidate. HPCD is associated with less pain, less thrombophlebitis, and no hemolysis without clinically important alteration of pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of etomidate.

Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and safety of a potential memory-enhancing compound, CL 275,838, in healthy male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1994.tb02035.x	The pharmacokinetics and safety of CL 275,838, a new potential memory-enhancing compound, were examined after 14 daily doses (50 and 100 mg) in 16 healthy male volunteers, age 20 to 59 years, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Trough blood samples (predose) were collected on days 2, 4, 7, 10, and 14, and further samples were drawn after the final dose (day 14) to define the multiple-dose kinetics of the parent compound and its metabolites II and IV. Intercurrent clinical events, vital functions, EEG, ECG, and cognitive tests (attention, verbal memory, and spatial memory) were considered as outcome measures of safety. Performance in cognitive tests was also studied to collect preliminary information on possible therapeutic action. Predose plasma concentrations of the parent compound and its two metabolites increased approximately in proportion to the dose, and accumulation was complete within 7 days, regardless of the dose. At steady state, mean Cmax and AUC of the parent compound and its two metabolites were dose related. Mean wash-out t1/2 was 18 to 20 hours for the parent compound, 22-23 hours for metabolite II, and 28-33 hours for metabolite IV; these elimination t1/2 are comparable for the two doses, and are similar to those observed in single-dose studies. For the 50-mg-dose group, predicted and observed average plasma concentrations (Css) of CL 275,838 and its two metabolites did not differ significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Attentiondrug effects', 'Cognitiondrug effects', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electrocardiography', 'Electroencephalography', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazinesadministration & dosageadverse effectspharmacokineticspharmacology', 'Pyrazolesadministration & dosageadverse effectspharmacokineticspharmacology', 'Pyrimidinesadministration & dosageadverse effectspharmacokineticspharmacology']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7929869/	['Azole', 'CL-275838', 'Piperazine']	[8027, 163983, 4837]	7929869	['1994', 'Jul']

DOI: 10.1002/ana.410340516	In vitro animal studies have suggested that thiamine is involved in the presynaptic release of acetylcholine. Total thiamine content in cholinergic nerve terminals is comparable with that of acetylcholine, and the phosphorylation state of thiamine changes with release of acetylcholine. Thiamine binds to nicotinic receptors and may exhibit anticholinesterase activity. Based on these observations, we investigated the effects of pharmacological doses of thiamine on the cognitive deficits induced by the anticholinergic scopolamine in healthy young adults using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-crossover design. Drug effects were assessed by P3 event-related potential, quantitated electroencephalography, and free recall memory. Conditions included (1) baseline, (2) thiamine 5 gm p.o. and scopolamine 0.007 mg/kg IM, and (3) lactose PO and scopolamine 0.007 mg/kg IM. Thiamine significantly reduced adverse effects of scopolamine on P3 latency, spectral components of electroencephalography, and memory recall. The results are consistent with a cholinomimetic effect of thiamine in the central nervous system. Additional studies are needed to delineate the basic mechanisms and possible therapeutic efficacy of thiamine at pharmacological dosages.

Electrophysiological and neuropsychological effects of a central alpha 2-antagonist atipamezole in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/0166-4328(93)90010-n	We studied the electrophysiological and neuropsychological effects of acute modulation of central noradrenergic (NA) transmission using a specific alpha 2-antagonist atipamezole (ATI) in sic healthy volunteers. ATI had effects on resting EEG, auditory event-related potentials and neuropsychological tests. Quantitative EEG revealed increased total power in frontal, parietal and temporo-occipital areas without significant changes in the mean or peak frequencies. Event-related potentials showed no effects on the active attention-related processing negativity or the passive mismatch negativity, but frontally recorded mean amplitude of target-P300 was decreased. Neuropsychological tests after ATI revealed improvement in Digit Span, more errors in Word Recognition task, and no effects on Moss spatial recognition task. In healthy subjects with intact NA systems and without any attention deficit, ATI produced evident NA overactivity. ATI decreased the spontaneous thalamocortical oscillation of EEG and improved focused attention (Digit Span). It impaired, however, more divided attention (decreased mean P300 amplitude, increased errors in Word Recognition).

Effects of acetaminophen and antipyrine on non-inflammatory pain and EEG activity.	DOI: 10.1016/0304-3959(92)90165-8	Antinociceptive effects of the 2 (each 1000 mg, orally) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) acetaminophen (paracetamol) and antipyrine (phenazone) were investigated with a non-inflammatory experimental pain model in 32 healthy volunteers. Phasic pain was induced by intracutaneously applied brief electrical pulses (20 msec). Pain ratings, cerebral potentials and the EEG delta power were measured in response to the stimuli. Unspecific effects upon the vigilance system were evaluated by spontaneous EEG, auditory evoked potentials and reaction times. The investigation was performed as a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Blood samples were taken to monitor the plasma concentrations of the active agents. Ninety minutes after medication the 2 NSAIDs produced similar effects upon all pain-relevant target variables, although the mean plasma concentration of antipyrine (15 micrograms/ml) was approximately twice that of acetaminophen (7.5 microgram/ml). Both NSAIDs reduced pain ratings by 6%, late cerebral potentials by 19%, and stimulus-induced delta power of the EEG by 21%. The antipyrine effects emerged earlier, in agreement with its faster kinetics. Both NSAIDs could be differentiated by their effects upon spontaneous EEG activity. Whereas acetaminophen mainly enhanced the power in the theta range, antipyrine predominantly depressed the alpha frequencies. None of the drugs influenced auditory evoked potentials and reaction times. The central effects of acetaminophen and antipyrine are discussed with respect to antinociception and decrease in vigilance.

Effects of granisetron and haloperidol, alone and in combination, on psychometric performance and the EEG.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1992.tb04109.x	1. The effects of granisetron (160 micrograms kg-1 body weight) and haloperidol (3 mg) on psychometric performance and the EEG were investigated in a randomised, single-blind, crossover, placebo controlled study of 12 healthy male volunteers. 2. There was evidence that haloperidol impaired psychometric performance; however its effects on the EEG were not clear cut. In contrast there was very little evidence to suggest that granisetron had any impact on performance or the EEG. 3. The findings from this study suggest that granisetron does not impair daytime function and that it can be co-administered with haloperidol without producing unwanted synergistic effects.

Proof-of-concept evidence for high-density EEG investigation of sleep slow wave traveling in First-Episode Psychosis.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-024-57476-2	"Schizophrenia is thought to reflect aberrant connectivity within cortico-cortical and reentrant thalamo-cortical loops, which physiologically integrate and coordinate the function of multiple cortical and subcortical structures. Despite extensive research, reliable biomarkers of such ""dys-connectivity"" remain to be identified at the onset of psychosis, and before exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Because slow waves travel across the brain during sleep, they represent an ideal paradigm to study pathological conditions affecting brain connectivity. Here, we provide proof-of-concept evidence for a novel approach to investigate slow wave traveling properties in First-Episode Psychosis (FEP) with high-density electroencephalography (EEG). Whole-night sleep recordings of 5 drug-naïve FEP and 5 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects were obtained with a 256-channel EEG system. One patient was re-recorded after 6 months and 3 years of continuous clozapine treatment. Slow wave detection and traveling properties were obtained with an open-source toolbox. Slow wave density and slow wave traveled distance (measured as the line of longest displacement) were significantly lower in patients (p < 0.05). In the patient who was tested longitudinally during effective clozapine treatment, slow wave density normalized, while traveling distance only partially recovered. These preliminary findings suggest that slow wave traveling could be employed in larger samples to detect cortical ""dys-connectivity"" at psychosis onset."

Multilead quantitative EEG profile of clozapine in resting and vigilance-controlled conditions.	DOI: 10.1016/0925-4927(96)02883-1	Clozapine is the prototype of a new class of drugs, referred to as 'atypical antipsychotics'. As a matter of fact, the antipsychotic activity of the drug was not predicted by the first studies with quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG), which actually reported an antidepressant pattern. All previous QEEG studies carried out in healthy subjects used a maximum of four leads, exploring only the posterior quadrants of the scalp. The present article reports findings of a multilead QEEG study carried out in 16 healthy men under resting and vigilance-controlled conditions. Increases in slow (delta, theta, and alpha1) and decreases in fast (alpha2 and beta) activities were found, corresponding to changes described for chlorpromazine-type antipsychotics. These results are compared with those of earlier studies. It is suggested that changes in the beta frequency range vary across subjects, whereas changes in slow and alpha activity are more consistent and critical for defining the QEEG profile of the drug.

Marked clozapine-induced slowing of EEG background over frontal, central, and parietal scalp areas in schizophrenic patients.	DOI: 10.1097/00004691-200101000-00003	The authors studied how clozapine treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia affects the scalp topographic distribution of different frequency bands on EEG. Twenty-one patients treated with clozapine, in addition to zero to two typical neuroleptics (13 patients were treated with clozapine as the only neuroleptic), were compared with two control groups: one of healthy subjects and another of patients with schizophrenia receiving one to three typical neuroleptics and no clozapine. Significant differences in the EEG topography were seen between the groups: The theta and delta powers and were increased in the clozapine group compared with the two other groups (P < 0.001). Changes were observed over all electrodes, and were most prominent at the frontal, central, and parietal electrode locations. The nonclozapine-treated group of patients and the healthy control group did not differ significantly from each other. These results suggest that the topographic EEG features caused by clozapine are quite specific to it and can be differentiated from those of other neuroleptics.

Effects of word frequency on semantic memory in schizophrenia: electrophysiological evidence for a deficit in linguistic access.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2009.10.010	Abnormal storage and/or access are among the hypothesized causes of semantic memory deficit in schizophrenia. Neuropsychological and connectionist models have emphasized functional systems that serve the processing of word meaning and frequency: semantic storage disturbance is presumed to result from weak representations of word meaning; defective access is assumed to result from compromises to pathways that activate word frequency knowledge. Candidate biological systems include neuromodulatory pathways that normally function to enhance neural signals (e.g., cholinergic system). Electrophysiological responding may be informative regarding the storage-access distinction for schizophrenia.

Quantitative EEG in schizophrenia and in response to acute and chronic clozapine treatment.	DOI: 10.1016/s0920-9964(00)00165-1	Topographic quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) power and frequency indices were collected in 17 treatment refractory, DSM-III diagnosed schizophrenic patients, before and after acute (single dose) and chronic (six weeks) clozapine treatment, as well as in 17 healthy volunteers. Prior to treatment, patients exhibited greater overall absolute theta power, slower mean alpha frequency and elevated absolute delta and total power in anterior regions. Acute dosing increased total spectrum power globally, slow wave power posteriorally, mean alpha frequency and beta power anteriorally and decreased alpha power posteriorally. Six weeks of clozapine treatment significantly reduced clinical ratings of positive and negative symptoms as well as symptoms of global psychopathology. Chronic treatment resulted in EEG slowing as shown by decreases in relative alpha power, mean beta/total spectrum frequency and by widespread increases in absolute total and delta/theta power. The preliminary findings suggest that brain electric profiling may be a promising tool for assessing and understanding the central impact of pharmacotherapeutic interventions in schizophrenia.

Cortical activity associated with auditory hallucinations.	DOI: 10.1097/00001756-200403010-00028	Auditory hallucinations are one the most enigmatic and hampering symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Non-invasive functional imaging techniques have begun to delineate the underlying neuronal basis. We investigated the spontaneous magnetoencephalographic activity in a 33-year-old male schizophrenic patient and compared the results to those obtained from 13 healthy controls. Despite current neuroleptic medication (clozapine) the patient was still suffering from auditory hallucinations. Using the dipole density method, we were able to demonstrate an increase of fast MEG activity (12.5-30 Hz) in the left auditory cortex associated with hallucinations. This activity was absent in healthy controls. We conclude that an increase in fast MEG activity in the auditory cortex is a neurophysiologic correlate for auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia.

Serotonergic dysfunction in schizophrenia assessed by the loudness dependence measure of primary auditory cortex evoked activity.	DOI: 10.1016/s0920-9964(03)00016-1	Increased serotonergic activity is discussed as an important pathogenetic factor in schizophrenia. Further support for this hypothesis is difficult to obtain due to the lack of valid indicators of the brain's serotonin system. A great deal of evidence discovered through human and animal studies suggests that a weak loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) indicates high serotonergic activity and vice versa. The LDAEP is a measure of auditory cortex activity, reflecting increase or decrease of auditory evoked potential amplitudes with increasing tone loudness, which is probably modulated by the serotonergic innervation there. This is true only for the LDAEP of the primary auditory cortex, since this region is more highly innervated by serotonergic fibers than the secondary auditory cortex. The LDAEP (N1/P2 component) of 25 inpatients with schizophrenia free of medication and 25 healthy controls matched by age and gender, were recorded. Using dipole source analysis, the LDAEP of primary (tangential dipole) and this of secondary auditory cortex (radial dipole) was separately analyzed. Following a 4-week treatment with the 5-HT(2) antagonists clozapine or olanzapine, patients were once again studied. The LDAEP of the primary, but not of the secondary auditory cortex, was significantly weaker in the patients with schizophrenia than in healthy volunteers, indicating enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. After treatment with the 5-HT(2) antagonists, the LDAEP (of the right hemisphere) tended to be increased, indicating normalization of serotonergic function in the patients with schizophrenia. These results suggest that the loudness dependence of primary auditory cortex evoked activity is well suitable to assess serotonergic dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Increased duration and altered topography of EEG microstates during cognitive tasks in chronic schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/s0165-1781(96)02938-1	The surface EEGs of 32 medicated chronic schizophrenic patients, 12 unmedicated chronic schizophrenics and 35 matched healthy controls were analyzed by adaptive segmentation of continuous EEG during a rest condition, a mental arithmetic task, and a CNV paradigm. Results indicate increased duration of brain microstates in both unmedicated and medicated schizophrenics as well as reduced topographic variability. These findings did not vary across the different tasks. Comparing different cognitive tasks, schizophrenics and controls alike showed task-related changes of electric field topography, of EEG microstate duration and of the number of very short microstates (single-peak segments). However, the topography of the microstates during the tasks differed significantly in both medicated and unmedicated schizophenics from that of controls. Age, sex and educational levels did not influence these findings. Neuroleptic medication correlated negatively with microstate duration in a dose-dependent way. There was an inverse relationship between topographic variability and negative symptoms as well as BPRS scores. It is concluded that the temporo-spatial characteristics of brain electric activity indicate an impoverished array of functional modes and enhanced stability of brain electrical microstates in schizophrenia.

Increased cortical inhibition in persons with schizophrenia treated with clozapine.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881107084002	It has been previously demonstrated that unmedicated persons with schizophrenia have deficits in cortical inhibition (CI) as indexed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This inhibition is largely mediated by cortical GABAergic mechanisms. It has also been demonstrated that these inhibitory deficits may be normalized with the use of atypical antipsychotic medications. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the effects of clozapine on TMS measures of CI and to compare these effects to unmedicated persons with schizophrenia and healthy subjects. We used two TMS inhibitory paradigms: short interval intra-cortical inhibition (SICI) and the cortical silent period (CSP) to evaluate CI in 10 clozapine-treated persons with schizophrenia, 6 unmedicated persons with schizophrenia and 10 healthy subjects. Clozapine-treated persons with schizophrenia had significantly longer CSPs compared with healthy subjects and unmedicated persons with schizophrenia. There were no significant differences in SICI between groups, however, the severity of psychotic symptoms was correlated with reduced SICI across all persons with schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that clozapine treatment is associated with greater CI in persons with schizophrenia and this increase may be related to potentiation of cortical GABAergic receptor mediated inhibitory neurotransmission. Our results also confirm previous findings suggesting that deficits in CI are related to the severity of psychotic symptoms in persons with schizophrenia.

MMN responsivity to manipulations of frequency and duration deviants in chronic, clozapine-treated schizophrenia patients.	DOI: 10.1016/j.schres.2010.11.028	Event-related potential (ERP) probing of abnormal sensory processes in schizophrenia with the mismatch negativity (MMN) has shown impairments in auditory change detection, but knowledge of the acoustic features leading to this deficit is incomplete. Changes in the duration and frequency properties of sound stimuli result in diminished MMNs in schizophrenia but it is unclear as to whether this reduced responsiveness is seen with more subtle changes in sound frequency. In a sample of 19 healthy controls and 21 patients with chronic schizophrenia treated with clozapine, MMN was assessed in response to tone frequency changes of 5%, 10% and 20%, and to tone duration changes. Patients exhibited reduced amplitudes and shorter latencies than controls to all frequency changes, and attenuated amplitudes to tone duration increments and decrements. Clozapine dose was related to MMN, with increasing dose being positively associated with frequency-MMN amplitudes (10% ∆f, 20% ∆f) and negatively associated with the amplitude and latency of duration-MMNs. These data support the well-established findings of auditory sensory abnormality in schizophrenia and underscore the sensitivity of MMN to relatively small auditory change detection deficits that may appear to characterize chronic schizophrenia.

A machine learning approach using P300 responses to investigate effect of clozapine therapy.	DOI: 10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347339	Clozapine (CLZ) is uniquely effective as a treatment for medication resistant schizophrenia. Information regarding its mechanism of action may offer clues to the pathophysiology of the disease and to improved treatment. In this study we employ a machine learning (ML) analysis of P300 evoked potentials obtained from quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) data to identify changes in the brain induced by CLZ treatment. We employ brain source localization (BSL) on the EEG signals to extract source waveforms from specified regions of the brain. A subset of 8 features is selected from a large set of candidate features (consisting of spectral coherences between all identified source waveforms at multiple frequencies) that discriminate (by means of a classifier) between the pre- and post-treatment data for the schizophrenics (SCZ) most responsive to CLZ. We show these same selected features also discriminate between pre-treatment most responsive SCZ and healthy volunteers (HV), but not after treatment. Of note, these same features discriminate the least responsive SCZ from HV both pre- and post-treatment.

A machine learning approach using auditory odd-ball responses to investigate the effect of Clozapine therapy.	DOI: 10.1016/j.clinph.2014.07.017	To develop a machine learning (ML) methodology based on features extracted from odd-ball auditory evoked potentials to identify neurophysiologic changes induced by Clozapine (CLZ) treatment in responding schizophrenic (SCZ) subjects. This objective is of particular interest because CLZ, though a potentially dangerous drug, can be uniquely effective for otherwise medication-resistant SCZ subjects. We wish to determine whether ML methods can be used to identify a set of EEG-based discriminating features that can simultaneously (1) distinguish all the SCZ subjects before treatment (BT) from healthy volunteer (HV) subjects, (2) distinguish EEGs collected before CLZ treatment (BT) vs. those collected after treatment (AT) for those subjects most responsive to CLZ, (3) discriminate least responsive subjects from HV AT, and (4) no longer discriminate most responsive subjects from HVs AT. If a set of EEG-derived features satisfy these four conditions, then it may be concluded that these features normalize in responsive subjects as a result of CLZ treatment, and therefore potentially provide insight into the functioning of the drug on the SCZ brain.

Study of the EEG changes during the combined ingestion of alcohol and H1-antihistamines by using the wavelet transform.	DOI: 10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352213	H(1)-antihistamines affect the central nervous system (CNS) and, therefore, electroencephalographic (EEG) changes should be expected to occur. The principal aim of this work was to assess the effects on the EEG when hydroxyzine 10 mg (HY) and cetirizine 25 mg (CE) were administered with and without alcohol 0.8 g/kg (AL). Thirty-three healthy young subjects participated in two placebo-controlled trials. In the first one, 15 subjects received placebo (PL), HY and CE. In the second trial, 18 volunteers took PL, AL, and AL in combination with HY and CE. CNS effects of the different treatment conditions were evaluated at baseline, as well as at +4 h and +1 h post-medication for each study, respectively. EEG recordings from electrodes O1 and O2 were analyzed using the wavelet transform. Then, several entropies were calculated from wavelet decomposition to detect changes in the pattern of regularity of the signals. The obtained results suggest that the concomitant ingestion of AL with HY reduces the changes in the irregularity of the EEG, opposite to the behavior observed for CE. Hence, wavelet entropies could be useful descriptors of the EEG alterations induced by several drugs in a different way that the conventional Fourier-based methods.

Pharmacokinetics of antofloxacin hydrochloride in healthy male subjects after multiple intravenous dose administration.	DOI: 10.3109/00498254.2011.565820	The purpose of the study was to evaluate pharmacokinetic characteristics of antofloxacin hydrochloride, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, during a multiple, intravenous dosing regimen. Twelve healthy, Chinese male volunteer subjects were each given 300 mg of antofloxacin by intravenous infusion once daily for 7 days. Blood and urine samples were taken at designated time points for analysis of antofloxacin concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Safety and tolerability were assessed by evaluation of subject complaints, vital signs, electrocardiograms, electroencephalograms, clinical chemistry parameters, haematology and urinalysis and prothrombin time. The serum steady concentration of antofloxacin was obtained in 96 h after the administration of a daily intravenous dose of 300 mg of the drug. In the present study, the following pharmacokinetic parameters after 7 days of treatment with antofloxacin were determined to be: C(max) 3.81 ± 0.66 mg/L, C(min) 0.85 ± 0.19 mg/L, AUC(0-24) 60.51 ± 8.30 mg/L·h, C(av) 2.52 ± 0.35 mg/L, PTF 87.45 ± 3.37%, t(1/2)β 20.34 ± 1.88 h. The C(max) and AUC(0-24) after 7-day treatment were both higher than after the first dose (by 43% and 110%, respectively). The cumulative urinary elimination of antofloxacin within 96 h after the last dose was about 56%. During the study, there were neither subject complaints nor significant adverse clinical findings. Antofloxacin, administered intravenously as a single, daily 300 mg dose for 7 days, demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics and tolerability. The results of this study indicate that antofloxacin hydrochloride is suitable for further clinical study.

Effects of DRD2 and CYP2D6 genotypes on delta EEG power response to aripiprazole in healthy male volunteers: a preliminary study.	DOI: 10.1002/hup.806	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms in dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genes on delta EEG power response to aripiprazole in healthy male volunteers. Seventeen volunteers were recruited according to the DRD2 Taq1A genotype, and separated into the following groups: homozygous wild-type (A2/A2, n = 7), heterozygous (A2/A1, n = 5) and homozygous variant-type (A1/A1, n = 5) groups. After enrollment in this study, they were genotyped for CYP2D6. The volunteers received single 10 mg oral doses of aripiprazole, in accordance with an open-label parallel group study design. Plasma levels of aripiprazole and its metabolite were determined and EEGs were obtained simultaneously. The pharmacodynamic parameter was absolute delta power in the Cz channel. The changes of delta power were not different according to DRD2 Taq1A genotypes. As to the CYP2D6 allele, the subjects had the following CYP2D6 genotypes: *10/*10 (n = 4), *1/*10 (n = 5), *1/*5 (n = 2), *1/*1 (n = 3), *2/*41 (n = 1), *2/*2 (n = 1), *2N/*10 (n = 1). Subjects exhibiting the *1/*5 and *1/*10 genotypes showed a trend toward high area under the plasma aripiprazole concentration-time curve (AUC), which was linearly related to area under the EEG response-time curve (AUEC). Our results demonstrate a need for further evaluation of the CYP2D6 genotypic effect on the pharmacodynamics of aripiprazole.

Pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of aripiprazole following multiple oral dosing in normal healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/0091270003261901	Two 14-day, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies evaluated the fasting pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole, a new antipsychotic, in healthy male subjects. In Study 1, 37 subjects were randomized to aripiprazole 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, or placebo once daily. In Study 2, 11 subjects were randomized to aripiprazole, titrated from 10 to 30 mg/day, or placebo. Aripiprazole had linear pharmacokinetics over 5 to 30 mg/day, which were described by a two-compartment open model, with first-order absorption. In Study 1, mean elimination half-life ranged from 47 to 68 hours with aripiprazole, with apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) of approximately 3.45 L/h. In Study 2, mean elimination half-life was 59 hours (CL/F approximately 4.0 L/h). Adverse events were generally mild to moderate, were transient in nature, and commonly occurred within the first 3 days of dosing. Clinical laboratory assessments, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and prolactin levels showed no clinically significant changes during the studies.

Pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of ascending single doses of moxifloxacin, a new 8-methoxy quinolone, administered to healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1128/AAC.42.8.2060	The pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin were investigated in six studies after oral administration of 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg. Eight healthy male volunteers were included in each study. With doses of up to 200 mg the study was performed as a double-blind, randomized group comparison (n = 6 verum and n = 2 matched placebo); with the higher doses the study was conducted with a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Safety and tolerability were assessed by evaluation of vital signs, electrocardiograms, electroencephalograms, clinical chemistry parameters, results of urinalysis, and adverse events. The drug was well tolerated. The concentrations of moxifloxacin in plasma, urine, and saliva were determined by a validated high-pressure liquid chromatography assay with fluorescence detection. In addition, plasma and urine samples were analyzed by a bioassay. A good correlation between both methods was seen, indicating an absence of major active metabolites. The mean maximum concentrations of moxifloxacin in plasma (Cmax) ranged from 0.29 mg/liter (50-mg dose) to 4.73 mg/liter (800-mg dose) and were reached 0.5 to 4 h following drug administration. After reaching the Cmax, plasma moxifloxacin concentrations declined in a biphasic manner. Within 4 to 5 h they fell to about 30 to 55% of the Cmax, and thereafter a terminal half-life of 11 to 14 h accounted for the major part of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). During the absorption phase concentrations in saliva were even higher than those in plasma, whereas in the terminal phase a constant ratio of the concentration in saliva/concentration in plasma of between 0.5 and 1 was observed, indicating a correlation between unbound concentrations in plasma and levels in saliva (protein binding level, approximately 48%). AUC and Cmax increased proportionally to the dose over the whole range of doses investigated. Urinary excretion amounted to approximately 20% of the dose. Data on renal clearance (40 to 51 ml/min/1.73 m2) indicated partial tubular reabsorption of the drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from compartmental and noncompartmental analyses were in good agreement. The kinetics could be described best by fitting the data to a two-compartment body model.

Pharmacokinetics and safety of NM441, a new quinolone, in healthy male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1994.tb04007.x	The safety and pharmacokinetics of NM441, a prodrug of a new thiazeto-quinoline carboxylic acid derivative, NM394, were evaluated in healthy male volunteers given the drug orally in single doses of 20, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg, and multiple doses of 300 mg twice daily for 6.5 days. No remarkable abnormalities were observed in symptoms, physical tests, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), or equilibrium test. The mean plasma concentrations of active metabolite NM394 peaked between 0.5 and 1.0 hours, and the maximum concentrations were 0.68, 1.09, and 1.88 micrograms/mL at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg, respectively. The mean half-lives were 7.7 to 8.9 hours and were not affected by dose. The mean urinary excretion rates of NM394 were 46.0, 38.3, and 30.6% of the doses within 48 hours, respectively, and other metabolites were excreted in urine by 7% of the doses. The mean salivary concentrations of NM394 were approximately 20% of the plasma concentrations. The mean fecal excretion rates of NM394 and NM441 were 52.9 and 4.2%, respectively within 72 hours after dosing of 400 mg. The Cmax, AUC, and urinary excretion rates were not altered by food intake, whereas the Tmax was prolonged slightly. In the multiple-dose study, the steady state of plasma concentration of NM394 was achieved on day 3 or 4, and further accumulation did not occur thereafter. The mean urinary excretion rate of NM394 was 49.0% during and 48 hours after the multiple administration. The acceptable safety and tolerance and defined pharmacokinetic characteristics of NM441 support further testing.

Pharmacokinetics and safety of single oral doses of lomefloxacin.	DOI: 10.1002/bdd.2510110608	The pharmacokinetics of 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, and 800 mg of lomefloxacin, a quinolone antimicrobial, were examined in a single sequential rising dose, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Each of 30 healthy male subjects (6 per group) received placebo and one dose of lomefloxacin, separated by 5 days. Test results (physical examinations, laboratory and hematology panels, vital signs, neurological and ophthalmological examinations, EEG or urinalysis) revealed no clinically significant differences compared to baseline. Mean Cmax values (0.92 micrograms ml-1 to 6.99 micrograms ml-1) increased linearly with dose. Mean tmax averaged 1.13 +/- 0.5 h and mean t1/2, 7.8 +/- 1.0 h over all doses. There was a small influence of dose on the AUC0-48. Mean urinary concentrations during the first 4 h postdosing ranged from 79 to 454 micrograms ml-1. Urine concentrations remained greater than or equal to 15 micrograms ml-1 over 24 h at the lowest dose. Maximum urinary excretion rate, Rmax, ranged from 5.84 mg h-1 to 34.90 mg h-1. Dose normalized Rmax and XU96 (per cent of dose) were unaffected by dose. Mean renal clearance decreased at higher doses. In conclusion, lomefloxacin was well tolerated in doses up to 800 mg. Lomefloxacin is rapidly absorbed with an elimination half-life of approximately 8 h. The data suggest that the drug can be effectively administered once daily.

Sleep-endocrine effects of mifepristone and megestrol acetate in healthy men.	DOI: 10.1152/ajpendo.1998.274.1.E139	Administration of steroid hormones was demonstrated to modulate the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and sleep-associated hormonal secretion in specific ways. The present study was conducted to compare the effects of mifepristone (Mif), a mixed glucocorticoid (GR) and progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist, and megestrol acetate (Meg), a PR agonist. Nine healthy men were pretreated with either placebo or 200 mg Mif or 320 mg Meg, or a combination of both. Changes in plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and growth hormone concentrations were registered every 30 min; sleep EEG recordings were obtained continuously. Administration of Mif increased the morning plasma ACTH and cortisol surges, whereas Meg had the opposite effect. Growth hormone secretion was lowered by Mif pretreatment and enhanced by Meg. Simultaneous administration of both compounds led to largely compensated effects. The sleep EEG changes induced by Mif were a slight increase in the time awake and a delayed onset of slow-wave sleep. Meg led to a reduction of rapid-eye-movement sleep. Simultaneous administration of Mif and Meg showed a synergism in increasing time awake and shallow sleep: it therefore may be concluded that the sleep EEG effects are mediated by an interaction of GR and PR in unknown mechanisms.

Sleep endocrine effects of antigluco- and antimineralocorticoids in healthy males.	DOI: 10.1152/ajpendo.1994.267.1.E109	In several mammalian species the responsiveness of brain neurons to corticosteroids is mediated by mineralo- (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors. These receptors play a key role not only in the endocrine adaptation to stress but also in corticosteroid-induced changes of behavior, including sleep. We further explored the specific physiological role of this binary receptor system in the human brain by studying electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep and changes in plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and growth hormone from 1800 to 0700 h in a series of investigations in healthy men pretreated the previous evening with the nonselective GR agonist dexamethasone (Dex) and then receiving at 1400 h either placebo, spironolactone (Spi), an MR antagonist, or mifepristone (Mif), a GR antagonist. The Dex-induced suppression of ACTH and cortisol was unaltered after Spi (200 mg) but attenuated by Mif treatment (400 mg). The sleep-associated plasma growth hormone surge was increased by Dex, an effect that remained unchanged by Spi but was reduced by Mif treatment. Pretreatment with Dex did not by itself induce recognizable effects on EEG sleep, but the Dex combination with Spi reduced the amount of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. With Dex plus Mif, both REM sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) were reduced compared with placebo. The Dex-induced endocrine effects on plasma ACTH, cortisol, and growth hormone concentrations could not be antagonized by Spi, which acts via MRs mainly located in the hippocampus, but were compensated for in part by Mif, which antagonizes GR at the pituitary and in the central nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adrenocorticotropic Hormoneblood', 'Adult', 'Dexamethasonepharmacology', 'Electroencephalography', 'Endocrine Glandsdrug effectsmetabolism', 'Glucocorticoidsantagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisoneblood', 'Male', 'Mifepristonepharmacology', 'Mineralocorticoidsantagonists & inhibitors', 'Reference Values', 'Sleepdrug effectsphysiology', 'Spironolactonepharmacology']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8048498/	['Mifepristone', 'Corticotropin']	[55245, 16132265]	8048498	['1994', 'Jul']
Long-range gamma phase synchronization as a compensatory strategy during working memory in high-performing patients with schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1080/13803395.2017.1420142	"Working memory deficits in schizophrenia may be associated with impairments in the integration of neural activity across a distributed network of cortical areas. However, evaluation of the contribution of this integration to working memory impairments in patients is severely confounded by behavioral performance. In the present multidimensional-neuroimaging study, measures of neural oscillations at baseline and during a working memory task, baseline gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) level in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and behavioral performance were obtained. Controlling behavioral performance by recruiting only ""high-performing"" patients with schizophrenia, we investigated whether the strength of cross-area communications differs between patients with schizophrenia and healthy participants under accurate and equivalent behavioral performance. Results of phase-locking value indicated that these high-performing patients recruited significantly more between frontal and occipital regions in the left hemisphere, t(13) = -2.16, p = .05, Cohen's d = -1.20, and between frontal and temporal regions in the right hemisphere, t(13) = -2.63, p = .02, Cohen's d = -1.46. These cross-area communication patterns may be associated with visuoverbal and visuospatial working memory networks of the left and right hemispheres, respectively. Moreover, correlations of patient's cross-area communication with in vivo GABA levels of the left DLPFC revealed a significant positive relationship (r = .77, p = .04), demonstrating that the critical role of GABA functions in gamma band oscillations may go beyond local neuronal assemblies in the left DLPFC. Altogether, these exploratory findings point to the heterogeneity among schizophrenia patients and highlight the notion that high-performing patients may engage in potential compensatory mechanisms and may represent a subgroup of patients that may be categorically or dimensionally divergent in psychopathology."

EEG and topographic frequency analysis in migraine attack before and after sumatriptan infusion.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1526-4610.1996.3602111.x	Electroencephalographic changes occurring in patients with migraine have received much attention. Although in migraineurs a number of studies have been done after nitroglycerin-induced attacks, there is no reported EEG study before and after nitroglycerin-induced sumatriptan-treated attacks. We, therefore, studied the EEG topographic frequency analysis in 19 symptom-free, otherwise healthy, unmedicated patients with common migraine and in 19 age- and sex-matched controls before nitroglycerin, at the time of maximum pain, and 30 minutes after sumatriptan. During headache attacks, an increase of slow rhythmic activity of the theta and delta range and a decrease of activity in the alpha and beta range were observed. These abnormalities disappeared 30 minutes after a sumatriptan injection. This suggests that common migraine is associated with disturbances of cortical electrogenesis and may provide insight into the causes of migraine and aid in the development of effective therapies.

Effects of caffeine and maltodextrin mouth rinsing on P300, brain imaging, and cognitive performance.	DOI: 10.1152/japplphysiol.01050.2014	Caffeine (CAF) and maltodextrin (MALT) mouth rinses (MR) improve exercise performance. The current experiment aims to determine the effect of CAF and MALT MR on cognitive performance and brain activity. Ten healthy male subjects (age 27 ± 3 yr) completed three experimental trials. Each trial included four Stroop tasks: two familiarization tasks, and one task before and one task after an MR period. The reaction time (in milliseconds) and accuracy (percent) of simple, congruent, and incongruent stimuli were assessed. Electroencephalography was applied throughout the experiment to record brain activity. The amplitudes and latencies of the P300 were determined during the Stroop tasks before and after the MR period. Subjects received MR with CAF (0.3 g/25 ml), MALT (1.6 g/25 ml), or placebo (PLAC) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. During MR, the brain imaging technique standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was applied. Magnitude-based inferences showed that CAF MR is likely trivial (63.5%) and likely beneficial (36.4%) compared with PLAC MR, and compared with MALT MR likely beneficial to reaction time on incongruent stimuli (61.6%). Additionally, both the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were activated only during CAF MR, potentially explaining the likely beneficial effect on reaction times. MALT MR increased brain activity only within the orbitofrontal cortex. However, this brain activation did not alter the reaction time. Furthermore, no significant differences in the accuracy of stimuli responses were observed between conditions. In conclusion, only CAF MR exerted a likely beneficial effect on reaction time due to the subsequent activation of both the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortexes.

Cardiovascular changes after achieving constant effect site concentration of propofol.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2044.2007.05315.x	Target controlled infusions of propofol use a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model to calculate an effect site concentration of the drug. We assessed the cardiovascular stability of 10 healthy patients using non-invasive thoracic bioimpedance and their 'depth' of anaesthesia using the Bispectral index after they had been anaesthetised to a constant effect site concentration of propofol (6.5 min from starting). Each patient had no surgical stimulus and received no intravenous fluid during the study period. The patients also received effect site target controlled remifentanil (steady state 2.5 min from starting) and a bolus of vecuronium to facilitate intubation and ventilation. We mathematically calculated when each measured parameter would reach a state of stability (i.e. with 95% certainty). Heart rate levelled off at 20 min, Bispectral index at 32 min, and cardiac index and mean arterial pressure at 47 min after achieving effect site stability, the final levels being, respectively, 21%, 47%, 14% and 28% lower than those at effect site stability. We conclude that cardiovascular parameters continue to change to a clinically significant degree after achieving a constant effect site concentration of propofol via target controlled infusions.

Relationship between the effects of a hypnotic drug, zopiclone, on polysomnography and on daytime EEGs.	DOI: 10.1159/000119337	The correlation between the effects of zopiclone (ZPC), a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug, on sleep polysomnograms and on daytime EEGs was examined in 12 healthy adult male volunteers. Sleep polysomnograms were recorded after a single oral administration of ZPC 10 mg or placebo according to the double-blind crossover method. Daytime EEGs were recorded after the administration of ZPC, 7.5 mg, or placebo in the same manner, and recorded for 3 min with closed eyes at rest. Then, square roots of the absolute power (amplitude) of the delta-, theta-, alpha-, and beta-activities were calculated from the power spectrum obtained by the fast Fourier transform method. As a result, ZPC decreased the percentage of stage 1 sleep in total sleep time, while it increased the percentage of stage 2, total sleep time, and time of slow wave sleep in the first and second sleep cycles (SWS 1 and 2). Changes in SWS 1 and 2 correlated positively with the amplitude changes in daytime resting delta-activity. This indicates that the increase of SWS due to ZPC could be related to the change of delta-activity in the daytime resting EEG.

The effect of single oral doses of zopiclone on nocturnal melatonin secretion in healthy male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/s0278-5846(01)00157-9	The effects of single oral doses of zopiclone and temazepam were investigated in eight healthy male volunteers using a single blind, placebo controlled cross over study. Doses of zopiclone were 7.5 and 15 mg while the dose of temazepam was 20 mg. Each dose was separated by at least a one-week washout period. For each subject the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was determined on a screening night and the drugs were administered at the time of the DLMO. Melatonin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay from plasma samples collected throughout the night. Both temazepam and zopiclone tended to reduce the amount of melatonin secreted, as determined by the area under the plasma concentration time curve. The differences from placebo were not statistically significant (F 3.31 = 1.07, P > 0.1). Similarly a repeated measures analysis of variance on the plasma concentration-time curves did not show any statistically significant differences between drugs and placebo (F 3.28 = 1.15, P > 0.1). There was no evidence from this study of a phase shifting effect of the drugs used. The reasons for the lack of effect on melatonin may be due to the differences in potency of the interaction of these drugs with the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride ion channel.

Comparison of the effect of zopiclone and brotizolam on sleep EEG by quantitative evaluation in healthy young women.	DOI: 10.1093/sleep/16.7.655	We studied the effect of brotizolam (BRO) (0.25 mg) and zopiclone (ZPC) (7.5 mg) on the sleep electroencephalograms (EEG) of seven healthy young women (ages 20-21 years). In addition to conventional sleep scoring, we performed spectral analysis of EEG wave forms using the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) method. Four weeks following two consecutive polysomnographic recordings with placebo administration (for baseline data), polysomnography with BRO or ZPC administration was performed on the subjects who were then crossed over to polysomnography with ZPC or BRO, respectively, 1 week later. Total rapid eye movement (REM) time was decreased on the ZPC and BRO nights and REM latency was prolonged on the ZPC night compared with baseline (BL) night. Other parameters, however, were not significantly different between the drug nights and the BL night. There were also no differences in standard scoring results between both drug nights. FFT analysis revealed significant differences in total power density percentage and mean power density percentage in both nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep between ZPC and BRO nights and between both drug nights compared to the BL night. Total power density and mean power density per epoch showed significant decreases in the theta band (6.0-8.0 Hz) and sigma band (12.0-14.0 Hz) on the ZPC night versus the BRO night or BL night during specific NREM periods. The results of this study corroborate previous reports that suggest computer-aided quantitative electroencephalography aids in differentiating specific effects of hypnotics and other central-nervous-system-acting agents on the sleep EEG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Azabicyclo Compounds', 'Azepinespharmacology', 'Braindrug effectsphysiology', 'Electroencephalography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypnotics and Sedativespharmacology', 'Piperazinespharmacology', 'Polysomnography', 'Reaction Timedrug effects', 'Reference Values', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Sleepdrug effects']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8290860/	['Zopiclone', 'Piperazine']	[5735, 4837]	8290860	['1993', 'Oct']
The effects of eszopiclone on sleep spindles and memory consolidation in schizophrenia: a randomized clinical trial.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-020-00833-2	Sleep spindles, defining oscillations of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep (N2), mediate memory consolidation. Schizophrenia is characterized by reduced spindle activity that correlates with impaired sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In a small, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study of schizophrenia, eszopiclone (Lunesta®), a nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotic, increased N2 spindle density (number/minute) but did not significantly improve memory. This larger double-blind crossover study that included healthy controls investigated whether eszopiclone could both increase N2 spindle density and improve memory. Twenty-six medicated schizophrenia outpatients and 29 healthy controls were randomly assigned to have a placebo or eszopiclone (3 mg) sleep visit first. Each visit involved two consecutive nights of high density polysomnography with training on the Motor Sequence Task (MST) on the second night and testing the following morning. Patients showed a widespread reduction of spindle density and, in both groups, eszopiclone increased spindle density but failed to enhance sleep-dependent procedural memory consolidation. Follow-up analyses revealed that eszopiclone also affected cortical slow oscillations: it decreased their amplitude, increased their duration, and rendered their phase locking with spindles more variable. Regardless of group or visit, the density of coupled spindle-slow oscillation events predicted memory consolidation significantly better than spindle density alone, suggesting that they are a better biomarker of memory consolidation. In conclusion, sleep oscillations are promising targets for improving memory consolidation in schizophrenia, but enhancing spindles is not enough. Effective therapies also need to preserve or enhance cortical slow oscillations and their coordination with thalamic spindles, an interregional dialog that is necessary for sleep-dependent memory consolidation.

A double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled study on the polysomnographic withdrawal effects of zopiclone, zolpidem and triazolam in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1007/s004060170045	Rebound effects after withdrawal from hypnotics are believed to trigger their chronic use and to enhance the risk of tolerance and dependence. It was the purpose of this study to investigate the acute polysomnographic withdrawal effects after a 4 week treatment with standard doses of the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem compared with triazolam and placebo. Healthy male subjects between 22 and 35 years of age participated in a parallel study design. They received either zopiclone 7.5 mg (n=11), zolpidem 10 mg (n=11), triazolam 0.25 mg (n=10) or placebo (n=7) over 4 weeks in randomized and double-blind order. Sleep EEG was registered during 2 nights before treatment under placebo, on days 1, 27 and 28 of treatment and on days 29,30,41 and 42 under placebo. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were lower in the 1st night after discontinuation of triazolam (p < 0.05, t-test). After withdrawal from zopiclone or zolpidem slight but not significant rebound effects concerning sleep continuity were observed. Self-rating scales showed minimal rebound insomnia after discontinuation of all three hypnotics. In the placebo group no changes of sleep parameters were observed. Assuming that rebound insomnia is part of a withdrawal reaction, this study indicates that the risks of tolerance and dependency are low when administering zopiclone or zolpidem at the recommended doses.

Effects of zopiclone on slow wave sleep and spontaneous K-complexes for normal healthy young adults.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1440-1819.1993.tb01838.x	Benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotics have been known to decrease, to some degree, human slow wave sleep (SWS) although they elevate the arousal threshold during sleep. Zopiclone (ZPC), a cyclopyrrolone hypnotic, has attracted the interest of sleep researchers because an increase in human SWS has been reported. Since the increase has not been fully confirmed by all of the studies, the authors investigated the effects of ZPC 10 mg on SWS and the K-complexes for 7 healthy young adults because there is evidence indicating that delta waves consisting of SWS and the spontaneous K-complexes are identical. SWS and st. 4 sleep did not decrease on any of the ZPC nights but st. 3 sleep showed a tendency to reduce on the 1st ZPC night. The frequency of the K-complexes decreased significantly on the 2nd ZPC night and tended to reduce on the 1st ZPC night. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was noted between the decrease rates of SWS and the K-complexes on both the ZPC nights. The authors, therefore, could not obtain any findings suggesting an increase in SWS with ZPC.

Pharmacological properties and mechanism of action of the cyclopyrrolones.		We present the pharmacological properties of two cyclopyrrolones, zopiclone as a hypnotic and suriclone as an anxiolytic, and examine their mechanism of action. The effects of zopiclone on the amount of time spent at each vigilance level have been studied in freely moving rats. Zopiclone from 2.5 mg/kg i.p. extends the duration of slow wave sleep (SWS), concomitantly shortening the periods awake. This SWS inducing effect of zopiclone was more potent after 10 mg/kg i.p.; moreover, zopiclone did not depress REM sleep and no rebound of activity in wakefulness or REM sleep were observed the day after zopiclone treatment. In rats, at the cortical level, zopiclone increases the spectral energy in the delta band (0.5 to 4 hertz). This rise in energy appears at doses starting from 1.25 mg/kg p.o. and can also reach the fast frequencies (beta band: 12 to 16 hertz). This power spectrum is characteristic of a compound having tranquilizing-hypnotic potential. Taken together these EEG results corroborate the clinical studies. In man, zopiclone increased SWS, decreased SWS latency and respected sleep architecture in both healthy volunteers and insomniacs. This respect of sleep structure and the relative short duration of action of zopiclone minimized the residual effects seen upon waking (drowsiness, impairment of psychomotor performance). In the Geller-Seifter test, an operant conflict procedure, the minimal effective dose (MED) of suriclone in reversing the conflict-induced inhibition of drinking behavior was 2.5 mg.kg-1 p.o. in rats. Depression of unpunished responding is only seen at higher doses (20 mg.kg-1 p.o.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Animals', 'Anti-Anxiety Agentspharmacologytherapeutic use', 'Anxietydrug therapy', 'Azabicyclo Compounds', 'Electroencephalography', 'Humans', 'Hypnotics and Sedativespharmacologytherapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Naphthyridines', 'Piperazinespharmacologytherapeutic use', 'Receptors, GABA-Adrug effects', 'Sleepdrug effects', 'Sulfur Compounds']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1363658/	['Zopiclone', 'Piperazine', 'Suriclone']	[5735, 4837, 40903]	1363658	['1992']

Zopiclone versus diazepam effects on EEG power maps in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.55782/ane-1997-1221	EEG effects of zopiclone (7.5 mg), a cyclopyrrolone derivative with hypnotic action, were compared with effects of diazepam (10 mg). Multichannel EEG recordings, double-blind crossover trials with placebo, and oral single doses were used in healthy volunteers. Vigilance-controlled EEG before and after zopiclone (and placebo), and before and after diazepam (and placebo) were analyzed into FFT power spectra. Effects were assessed as placebo-referred pre-post-medication power differences in four frequency bands. Overall statistics showed significant (P < 0.007) global differences between medication effects in the delta frequency band (0.5-3.5 Hz). After zopiclone, fronto-central delta increased bilaterally, whereas after diazepam delta decreased over centro-parietal to right temporo-occipital regions. These spatially different brain electric effects show that different neuronal populations must have become active in response to zopiclone and diazepam.

Functional properties of the brain during sleep under subchronic zopiclone administration in man.	DOI: 10.1016/0924-977x(94)90311-5	Zopiclone, a non-benzodiazepine, has been shown to be efficient in the treatment of transient, short-term or chronic sleep disorders. Apart from its hypnotic effects zopiclone has anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and myorelaxant properties and is therefore hardly distinguishable from benzodiazepines. Dependence liability and discontinuation effects have been reported to be less pronounced. Therefore zopiclone seems to be a hypnotic drug which may cause fewer side effects than conventional benzodiazepines. From the electrophysiological point of view one requires from a hypnotic drug the induction of a physiological sleep pattern as well as no alterations of information processing by the brain. The aim of the present study was to investigate the subchronic effect of zopiclone medication on some functional properties of the sleep EEG in healthy subjects. In order to get better insight into the principles of information processing by the brain during sleep and its alterations under the influence of zopiclone we applied some tools from linear system theory to sleep EEG data. For this purpose we investigated late components of auditory and visual evoked potentials during different sleep stages and calculated from these the so-called amplitude-frequency characteristic of the brain. This function describes the relationship between an input and the output of the investigated system. The main advantage of this kind of analysis is that it enables one to detect functional differences during sleep stages. This information can hardly be obtained from conventional spectral analysis. As a result we could demonstrate that under subchronic zopiclone medication no quantitative or qualitative alterations of the functional sleep EEG properties concerning the transfer properties of the brain under auditory and visual stimulation were detectable.

A quantitative sleep-EEG study on the effects of benzodiazepine and zopiclone in schizophrenic patients.	DOI: 10.1016/0920-9964(94)00054-c	Polysomnographic examinations (PSG) were performed on 6 male schizophrenic outpatients who were being treated with benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotics in combination with neuroleptics and 6 healthy male volunteers. In schizophrenic subjects, zopiclone (ZPC), 15 mg/day, was substituted for the BZD hypnotics, and PSGs were recorded again during ZPC therapy. All-night sleep stage scoring was carried out by visual analysis, and computerized period-amplitude analysis of sleep EEG was also performed. The schizophrenics showed marked reduction in the amount of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and in the number of delta half-waves during all-night sleep, especially those with higher amplitude, as compared to the normals. The number of delta half-waves in the patients was markedly reduced during the first sleep cycle. The average amplitude of delta half-waves during all-night sleep in the schizophrenics was significantly lower than that in the normals. The half-wave count of total delta waves in the schizophrenics was higher during treatment with ZPC than with BZDs, although no significant differences were observed in the amount of SWS between the two treatments. Soundness of sleep in the subjective sleep assessment was better evaluated during treatment with ZPC than BZDs. These results suggest that reduction of SWS in schizophrenia may be attributable mainly to the decrease in the number of delta waves with higher amplitude and that ZPC may induce deeper sleep in schizophrenics than BZDs.

Dynamics of slow-wave activity and spindle frequency activity in the human sleep EEG: effect of midazolam and zopiclone.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1380110	Electroencephalographic slow-wave activity (SWA; power density in the 0.75 to 4.5 Hz band) and spindle frequency activity (SFA; 11.25 to 15.0 Hz) exhibit a typical time course and a distinct mutual relationship during sleep. Because benzodiazepines (BDZ) suppress SWA and enhance SFA, we investigated the effect of two BDZ-receptor agonists on the dynamics of these EEG parameters. A single dose of midazolam (15 mg), zopiclone (7.5 mg), or placebo was administered before bedtime to healthy young men. Although the two drugs reduced SWA and enhanced SFA, their time course across and within sleep cycles as well as their mutual relationship were little affected. The results constitute further evidence that hypnotics acting as BDZ-receptor agonists do not substantially interfere with the homeostatic aspect of sleep regulation.

Acute, subchronic and discontinuation effects of zopiclone on sleep EEG and nocturnal melatonin secretion.	DOI: 10.1016/0924-977x(96)00014-4	Zopiclone is a new short half-life cyclopyrrolone hypnotic agent acting at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. In order to characterize its pharmacological profile, the effects of 7.5 mg zopiclone on nocturnal melatonin secretion were investigated under polysomnographic control in 11 healthy subjects following acute and subchronic administration as well as after abrupt discontinuation of the drug. No effect of zopiclone on the melatonin plasma levels could be observed. Regarding both total melatonin production and the temporal pattern of melatonin secretion during the night, there was no difference between placebo baseline condition, acute and subchronic administration, and discontinuation. In contrast, the sleep EEG data demonstrated the hypnotic efficacy of zopiclone under acute administration and indicated a rebound insomnia after abrupt discontinuation. Moreover, alterations of sleep architecture were found under treatment as well as after discontinuation. Whereas, with regard to sleep EEG parameters, zopiclone appears to be comparable with some short-acting benzodiazepines, a discrepancy between the missing effect of zopiclone on pineal function and the suppressing influence of benzodiazepines known from the literature becomes obvious.

Effect of zopiclone and midazolam on sleep and EEG spectra in a phase-advanced sleep schedule.		Midazolam (15 mg), a benzodiazepine (BDZ) hypnotic, and zopiclone (7.5 mg), a non-BDZ hypnotic, were administered to young, healthy subjects prior to bedtime. They went to bed at 2300 hours after taking placebo (PL-23), and then on three occasions at 1900 hour after taking placebo (PL-19) or one of the hypnotics. Advancing bedtime by 4 hour increased the combined value of waking, stage 1, and movement time. Compared to PL-19, both drugs reduced sleep latency and stage 3, and increased stage 2. Spectral analysis of the EEG in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep revealed a declining trend of power density in the low-frequency range in the course of the night. Activity in the 1 to 10 Hz range was markedly depressed by the two hypnotics, whereas activity in the spindle range (11 to 14 Hz) was augmented. The former changes persisted throughout the 12-hour recording period. The fact that both hypnotics bind to BDZ receptors could be responsible for the similar effects on the EEG spectra.

Effects of mianserin on human sleep.	DOI: 10.1159/000119485	Sleep EEG and nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) were investigated in 6 healthy men during placebo and mianserin administration and after mianserin withdrawal. The results were assessed in a historical comparison with those previously obtained with clomipramine. With mianserin, REM sleep was suppressed slightly. However, the suppressive effect of mianserin on REM sleep--based on the historical comparison--was significantly weaker than that of clomipramine throughout all the drug nights. Accordingly, a rebound increase in REM sleep was not observed after withdrawal. Less suppressive effects on NPT and disturbance of sexual function with mianserin than with clomipramine were observed. We suggest that a correlation between the prolonging effect on REM latency and the clinical antidepressant effect is limited to some antidepressants.

Anxiolytic effects of low-dose clomipramine in highly anxious healthy volunteers assessed by frontal midline theta activity.	DOI: 10.1016/s0278-5846(97)00182-6	1. The appearance of Fm theta, the distinct EEG theta rhythm in the frontal midline area during performance of a mental task, reflects relief from anxiety in humans. 2. In the present study, the anxiolytic effects of low-dose clomipramine were examined by monitoring the Fm theta amount, the STAI scores and the plasma 5-HIAA concentration in 24 male university students with (Fm theta group, n = 12) and without (non-Fm theta group, n = 12) Fm theta. 3. Subjects were given placebo, 10 mg and 30 mg clomipramine in a double-blind crossover design. Blood samples were obtained, STAI scores were determined, and EEGs were recorded before and during the performance of an arithmetic addition task. The test was repeated twice: before and 3 hrs after drug administration. 4. In the non-Fm theta group, 10 mg clomipramine decreased the 5-HIAA concentration and state anxiety scores but increased the Fm theta amount, while 30 mg clomipramine slightly increased only the Fm theta amount. However, there were no differences in these items before and after clomipramine administration in the Fm theta group. 5. These results suggest that low doses of clomipramine such as 10 mg may exert anxiolytic effects during the acute phase of treatment in highly anxious humans.

Brain potentials of conflict and error-likelihood following errorful and errorless learning in obsessive-compulsive disorder.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006553	The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is thought to be overacting in patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) reflecting an enhanced action monitoring system. However, influences of conflict and error-likelihood have not been explored. Here, the error-related negativity (ERN) originating in ACC served as a measure of conflict and error-likelihood during memory recognition following different learning modes. Errorless learning prevents the generation of false memory candidates and has been shown to be superior to trial-and-error-learning. The latter, errorful learning, introduces false memory candidates which interfere with correct information in later recognition leading to enhanced conflict processing.

Neurophysiological signature of gamma-hydroxybutyrate augmented sleep in male healthy volunteers may reflect biomimetic sleep enhancement: a randomized controlled trial.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-019-0382-z	Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is an endogenous GHB/GABAB receptor agonist, which has demonstrated potency in consolidating sleep and reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. Little is known whether GHB's efficacy reflects the promotion of physiological sleep mechanisms and no study has investigated its sleep consolidating effects under low sleep pressure. GHB (50 mg/kg p.o.) and placebo were administered in 20 young male volunteers at 2:30 a.m., the time when GHB is typically given in narcolepsy, in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover manner. Drug effects on sleep architecture and electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep spectra were analyzed. In addition, current source density (CSD) analysis was employed to identify the effects of GHB on the brain electrical sources of neuronal oscillations. Moreover, lagged-phase synchronization (LPS) analysis was applied to quantify the functional connectivity among sleep-relevant brain regions. GHB prolonged slow-wave sleep (stage N3) at the cost of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Furthermore, it enhanced delta-theta (0.5-8 Hz) activity in NREM and REM sleep, while reducing activity in the spindle frequency range (13-15 Hz) in sleep stage N2. The increase in delta power predominated in medial prefrontal cortex, parahippocampal and fusiform gyri, and posterior cingulate cortex. Theta power was particularly increased in the prefrontal cortex and both temporal poles. Moreover, the brain areas that showed increased theta power after GHB also exhibited increased lagged-phase synchronization among each other. Our study in healthy men revealed distinct similarities between GHB-augmented sleep and physiologically augmented sleep as seen in recovery sleep after prolonged wakefulness. The promotion of the sleep neurophysiological mechanisms by GHB may thus provide a rationale for GHB-induced sleep and waking quality in neuropsychiatric disorders beyond narcolepsy.

Effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate on neurophysiological correlates of performance and conflict monitoring.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2019.02.004	Performance and conflict monitoring (PM and CM) represent two essential cognitive abilities, required to respond appropriately to demanding tasks. PM and CM can be investigated using event-related brain potentials (ERP) and associated neural oscillations. Namely, the error-related negativity (ERN) represents a correlate of PM, whereas the N2 component reflects the process of CM. Both ERPs originate in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and PM specifically has been shown to be susceptible to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor activation. Contrarily, the specific effects of GABAB receptor (GABABR) stimulation on PM and CM are unknown. Thus, the effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB; 20 and 35 mg/kg), a predominant GABABR agonist, on behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of PM and CM were here assessed in 15 healthy male volunteers, using the Eriksen-Flanker paradigm in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were analyzed in the time and time-frequency domains. GHB prolonged reaction times, without affecting error rates or post-error slowing. Moreover, GHB decreased ERN amplitudes and associated neural oscillations in the theta/alpha1 range. Similarly, neural oscillations associated with the N2 were reduced in the theta/alpha1 range, while N2 amplitude was conversely increased. Hence, GHB shows a dissociating effect on electrophysiological correlates of PM and CM. Reduced ERN likely derives from a GABABR-mediated increase in dopaminergic signaling, disrupting the generation of prediction errors, whereas an enhanced N2 suggests an increased susceptibility towards external stimuli. Conclusively, GHB is the first drug reported, thus far, to have opposite effects on PM and CM, underlined by its unique electrophysiological signature.

The critical role of sleep spindles in hippocampal-dependent memory: a pharmacology study.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3127-12.2013	An important function of sleep is the consolidation of memories, and features of sleep, such as rapid eye movement (REM) or sleep spindles, have been shown to correlate with improvements in discrete memory domains. Because of the methodological difficulties in modulating sleep, however, a causal link between specific sleep features and human memory consolidation is lacking. Here, we experimentally manipulated specific sleep features during a daytime nap via direct pharmacological intervention. Using zolpidem (Ambien), a short-acting GABAA agonist hypnotic, we show increased sleep spindle density and decreased REM sleep compared with placebo and sodium oxybate (Xyrem). Naps with increased spindles produced significantly better verbal memory and significantly worse perceptual learning but did not affect motor learning. The experimental spindles were similar to control spindles in amplitude and frequency, suggesting that the experimental intervention enhanced normal sleep processes. Furthermore, using statistical methods, we demonstrate for the first time a critical role of spindles in human hippocampal memory performance. The gains in memory consolidation exceed sleep-alone or control conditions and demonstrate the potential for targeted, exceptional memory enhancement in healthy adults with pharmacologically modified sleep.

The effect of gamma-hydroxybutyrate on nocturnal and diurnal sleep of normal subjects: further considerations on REM sleep-triggering mechanisms.	DOI: 10.1093/sleep/13.1.24	Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a drug currently used to treat narcolepsy. The present study documents its effect on sleep organization in healthy subjects. GHB and a placebo were given at bedtime and before a morning nap in a double-blind fashion. GHB administered before nocturnal or diurnal sleep increases stages 3 and 4 and decreases stage 1 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In addition, GHB improves REM efficiency at night and reduces wake time after sleep onset when administered before a morning nap recording. GHB also slightly decreases REM latency when administered in the morning, and this effect is correlated with age. Hypotheses regarding mechanisms of action GHB and the involvement of hypothalamic structures in the regulation of REM sleep are discussed.

Connectivity strength of the EEG functional network in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2019.109801	The application of graph theory measures in the study of functional brain networks allows for the description of their general properties and their alterations in mental illness. Among these measures, connectivity strength (CS) estimates the degree of functional connectivity of the whole network. Previous studies in schizophrenia patients have reported higher baseline CS values and modulation deficits in EEG spectral properties during cognitive activity. The specificity of these alterations and their relationships with pharmacological treatments remain unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we assessed functional CS on EEG-based brain networks in 79 schizophrenia and 29 bipolar patients in addition to 63 healthy controls. The subjects performed a P300 task during the EEG recordings from which the pre-stimulus and the task-related modulation CS values were computed in the global and theta bands. These values were compared between the groups and between the patients who had and had not received different treatments. The global band pre-stimulus CS was significantly higher in the schizophrenia group compared with the bipolar and control groups. Theta band CS modulation was decreased in schizophrenia and bipolar patients. Treatment with antipsychotics, lithium, benzodiazepines, and anticonvulsants did not significantly alter these CS values. The first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients did not show significant differences in CS values. Higher global band pre-stimulus CS values were associated with worse general cognition in schizophrenia patients. These data support increased connectivity in the whole-brain network that is specific to schizophrenia and suggest a general hyper-synchronized basal state that might hamper cognition in this syndrome.

Increased Beta Frequency (15-30 Hz) Oscillatory Responses in Euthymic Bipolar Patients Under Lithium Monotherapy.	DOI: 10.1177/1550059414561056	The effect of lithium on neurocognition is not still fully explored. Brain oscillatory activity is altered in bipolar disorder. We aimed to assess the oscillatory responses of euthymic bipolar patients and how they are affected by lithium monotherapy. Event-related oscillations in response to visual target stimulus during an oddball paradigm in 16 euthymic drug-free and 13 euthymic lithium-treated bipolar patients were compared with 16 healthy controls. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes were measured for each subject's averaged beta (15-30 Hz) responses in the 0- to 300-ms time window over frontal (F3, Fz, F4), central (C3, Cz, C4), temporal (T7, T8), temporo-parietal (TP7, TP8), parietal (P3, Pz, P4), and occipital (O1, Oz, O2) areas. Patients under lithium monotherapy had significantly higher beta responses to visual target stimuli than healthy controls (P=.017) and drug-free patients (P=.015). The increase in beta response was observed at all electrode locations, however, the difference was statistically significant for the left (T7; P=.016) and right (T8; P=.031) temporal beta responses. Increased beta responses in drug-free patients and further significant increase in lithium-treated patients may be indicative of a core pathophysiological process of bipolar disorder and how it is affected by lithium. Whether the finding corresponds to lithium's corrective effect on the underlying pathology or to its neurocognitive side effect remains to be further explored. In either case, the finding is a sign that the oscillatory activity may be useful in tracking medication effect in bipolar disorder.

Differential effects of endogenous lithium on neurobehavioural functioning: a study on auditory evoked potentials.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psychres.2009.04.021	Lithium occurs naturally in food and water. Low environmental concentrations in drinking water are associated with mental illnesses and behavioural offences, and at therapeutic dosages it is used to treat psychiatric (especially affective) disorders, partly by facilitating serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission. As little is known about the psychophysiological role of nutritional lithium in the general population, endogenous lithium concentrations were hypothesised to be associated with measurable effects on emotional liability and the loudness dependence (LD) that is proposed as one of the most valid indicators of 5-HT neurotransmission. Auditory evoked potentials of healthy volunteers [N=36] with high (>2.5 microg/l) or low (<1.5 microg/l) lithium serum concentrations were recorded. Emotional liability was assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Low-lithium levels correlated with Somatisation while correlations between lithium and LD were not significant. Still, LD correlated positively with Paranoid Ideation, negatively with Anxiety and, in the high-lithium group, inversely with further aspects of emotional liability (Depression, Psychological Distress). In conclusion, the effects of low levels of endogenous lithium are associated with emotional liability, and high levels with some protective effects, although findings remain inconclusive regarding LD. Potential benefits of endogenous lithium on neurobehavioural functioning, especially in high-risk individuals, would have public health implications.

Slowing of EEG waves correlates with striatal [18 F]fluorodopa PET/CT uptake and executive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1111/ejn.16156	Parkinson's disease (PD) research on specific neuroimaging and neurophysiological biomarkers revealing executive dysfunction mechanisms is limited, necessitating validation. Thus, our study aimed to assess associations between electroencephalographic power spectral density (PSD-EEG), striatal [18 F]Fluorodopa uptake and neuropsychological executive function (EF) testing parameters in PD, while also estimating their diagnostic accuracy. We compared resting PSD-EEG, striatal [18 F]Fluorodopa uptake ratios based on positron emission computed tomography ([18 F]FDOPA PET/CT) and neuropsychological EF tests outcomes [Trail Making Test (TMT) and Stroop Test (ST)] between PD patients and healthy controls (HCO) and then calculated correlations among these measures separately for each group. Additionally, we estimated PD diagnostic accuracy of the PSD-EEG and [18 F]FDOPA PET/CT parameters. In PD patients, we observed the following: (i) slower EEG waves, reflected in increased power of the EEG theta and lower-alpha bands in frontal lobe areas; (ii) reduced [18 F]FDOPA PET/CT uptake in the putaminal and caudate nuclei, along with a decreased putamen-to-caudate ratio ([18 F]FDOPA PET/CT PCR); and (iii) longer performance times evident in nearly all EF tests' parameters. Slower EEG waves correlated negatively with [18 F]FDOPA PET/CT PCR and positively with most of the EF test parameters. Furthermore, we found negative correlations between [18 F]FDOPA PET/CT PCR and certain EF measures related to ST. [18 F]FDOPA PET/CT ratios and several PSD-EEG parameters, particularly those from the prefrontal cortex, demonstrated clinically reasonable diagnostic accuracy for PD. In conclusion, EEG waves slowing in the frontal lobe were correlated with striatal dopaminergic deficiency and impaired executive function in mild PD patients and showed promise as a biomarker of PD-related executive dysfunction.

First-in-human trial to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of zagociguat (CY6463), a CNS-penetrant soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulator.	DOI: 10.1111/cts.13537	Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and its product, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, play a role in learning and memory formation. Zagociguat (CY6463) is a novel stimulator of sGC being developed for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. Single zagociguat doses of 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20, 30, and 50 mg were administered once to healthy participants in a single-ascending-dose phase; then zagociguat 2, 5, 10, and 15 mg was administered q.d. for 14 days in a multiple-ascending-dose phase; and, finally, zagociguat 10 mg was administered once in both fed and fasted state in a food-interaction phase. Safety of zagociguat was evaluated by monitoring treatment-emergent adverse events, suicide risk, vital signs, electrocardiography, and laboratory tests. Pharmacokinetics of zagociguat were assessed through blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid sampling. Pharmacodynamic effects of zagociguat were evaluated with central nervous system (CNS) tests and pharmaco-electroencephalography. Zagociguat was well-tolerated across all doses evaluated. Zagociguat exposures increased in a dose-proportional manner. Median time to maximum concentration ranged from 0.8 to 5 h and mean terminal half-life from 52.8 to 67.1 h. CNS penetration of the compound was confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid sampling. Zagociguat induced up to 6.1 mmHg reduction in mean systolic and up to 7.5 mmHg reduction in mean diastolic blood pressure. No consistent pharmacodynamic (PD) effects on neurocognitive function were observed. Zagociguat was well-tolerated, CNS-penetrant, and demonstrated PD activity consistent with other sGC stimulators. The results of this study support further development of zagociguat.

Measuring eye states in functional MRI.	DOI: 10.1186/s12868-016-0282-7	In many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, experimental design often depends on the eye state (i.e., whether the participants had their eyes open or closed). Closed eyes during an fMRI is the general convention, particularly when patients are in a resting-state, but the eye state is difficult to verify. Although knowledge of the impact of the eye state on brain activity is steadily growing, only a few research groups have implemented standardized procedures to monitor eye movements and eye state. These procedures involve advanced methods that are costly (e.g., fMRI-compatible cameras) and often time-consuming (e.g., EEG/EOG).

Relationship of auditory electrophysiological responses to magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolites in Early Phase Psychosis.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2019.05.009	Both auditory evoked responses and metabolites measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are altered in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, but the relationship between electrophysiological and metabolic changes are not well characterized. We examined the relation of MRS metabolites to cognitive and electrophysiological measures in individuals during the early phase of psychosis (EPP) and in healthy control subjects. The mismatch negativity (MMN) of the auditory event-related potential to duration deviant tones and the auditory steady response (ASSR) to 40 Hz stimulation were assessed. MRS was used to quantify glutamate+glutamine (Glx), N-Acetylasparate (NAA), creatine (Cre), myo-inositol (Ins) and choline (Cho) at a voxel placed medially in the frontal cortex. MMN amplitude and ASSR power did not differ between groups. The MRS metabolites Glx, Cre and Cho were elevated in the psychosis group. Partial least squares analysis in the patient group indicated that elevated levels of MRS metabolites were associated with reduced MMN amplitude and increased 40 Hz ASSR power. There were no correlations between the neurobiological measures and clinical measures. These data suggest that elevated neurometabolites early in psychosis are accompanied by altered auditory neurotransmission, possibly indicative of a neuroinflammatory or excitotoxic disturbance which disrupts a wide range of metabolic processes in the cortex.

Use of short echo time two-dimensional 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy in temporal lobe epilepsy with negative magnetic resonance imaging findings.	DOI: 10.1177/147323000903700428	We evaluated short echo time two-dimensional 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (2D-1HMRS) with the point-resolved spatial selection (PRESS) protocol in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and described the characteristics of 2D-(1)HMRS in the epileptic focus. Thirty-eight TLE patients with negative conventional MRI findings and 10 healthy controls were studied by 2D-1HMRS. A 128-channel prolonged video-electroencephalographic (EEG) method was used as the standard for epileptogenic focus localization to evaluate N-acetyl aspartate/(choline + creatine + phosphocreatine) (NAA/[Cho + Cr-PCr]), glutamate + glutamine/creatine (Glx/Cr-PCr) and myo-inositol/Cr-PCr ratios in patients with negative MRI findings. The 2D-1HMRS showed that 32/38 patients and all healthy controls had stable baselines and good signal-to-noise ratios. Compared with the healthy controls, 32 patients showed abnormal NAA/(Cho + Cr-PCr) ratios in the hippocampus and, in 25 of these patients, focus lateralization agreed with the EEG. It is concluded that short echo time 2D-1HMRS with the PRESS protocol can help find abnormalities in lateralization of temporal epilepsy in patients with negative MRI findings.

Dopaminergic and noradrenergic manipulation of anticipatory reward and probability event-related potentials.	DOI: 10.1007/s00213-020-05515-x	Predicting what will happen in the future in terms of potential reward is essential in daily life. The aim of the current study was to investigate the neurotransmitter systems involved in the anticipation of reward value and probability. We hypothesized that dopaminergic and noradrenergic antagonism would affect anticipation of reward value and probability, respectively. Twenty-three healthy participants were included in a haloperidol (2 mg) × clonidine (0.150 mg) × placebo cross-over design and subjected to a Go/NoGo experimental task during which cues signaled the probability of subsequent target appearance. Reward value (amount of money that could be won for correct and fast responding to the target) as well as probability of target appearance was orthogonally manipulated across four task blocks. Cue-elicited EEG event-related potentials were recorded to assess anticipation of value and probability, respectively. The processing of reward value was affected by dopaminergic antagonism (haloperidol), as evidenced by reduction of the reward-related positivity and P300 to reward cues. This reduction was specifically significant for subjects with high baseline dopamine levels for the P300 and most pronounced for these subjects for the reward-related positivity. In contrast, the processing of reward probability was affected by noradrenergic antagonism (clonidine). In addition, both drugs reduced overall performance (omission rate, response speed variability). We conclude that at least anticipation of reward value and probability, respectively, is specifically affected by dopaminergic versus noradrenergic antagonism.

DOI: 10.3109/10428194.2014.915546	To assess the effects of chemoimmunotherapy on post-chemotherapy cognitive impairments (PCCI) in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), we used objective and subjective measures of cognitive functions in combination with serum parameters and neuroelectric recordings. Self-perceived status of cognition, fatigue and emotional functioning were reduced in patients (n=30) compared to healthy controls (n=10). Cognitive performance was impaired in patients with NHL compared to controls and a norm sample (n=1179). PCCI was more severe in patients treated with rituximab and bendamustine (BR) than in patients who received R in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) polychemotherapy (R-CHOP). Individual alpha peak frequency and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in patients with NHL correlated with accuracy in the objective cognition test. Higher serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations were associated with higher fatigue levels. Patients with NHL and especially those who were treated with BR were affected by PCCI. BDNF and IL-6 might be involved in the pathogenesis of PCCI and fatigue.

A highly stable electrode with low electrode-skin impedance for wearable brain-computer interface.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bios.2022.114756	To date, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have proved to play a key role in many medical applications, for example, the rehabilitation of stroke patients. For post-stroke rehabilitation, the BCIs require the EEG electrodes to precisely translate the brain signals of patients into intended movements of the paralyzed limb for months. However, the gold standard silver/silver-chloride electrodes cannot satisfy the requirements for long-term stability and preparation-free recording capability in wearable EEG devices, thus limiting the versatility of EEG in wearable BCI applications over time outside the rehabilitation center. Here, we design a long-term stable and low electrode-skin interfacial impedance conductive polymer-hydrogel EEG electrode that maintains a lower impedance value than gel-based electrodes for 29 days. With this technology, EEG-based long-term and wearable BCIs could be realized in the near future. To demonstrate this, our designed electrode is applied for a wireless single-channel EEG device that detects changes in alpha rhythms in eye-open/eye-close conditions. In addition, we validate that the designed electrodes could capture oscillatory rhythms in motor imagery protocols as well as low-frequency time-locked event-related potentials from healthy subjects, with similar or better performance than gel-based electrodes. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the designed electrode in online BCI-based functional electrical stimulation, which could be used for post-stroke rehabilitation.

Analysis of brain activity during visceral stimulation.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2012.07072.x	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a useful technology for investigating regional metabolic activity in the brain. Many experiments using fMRI have been performed, but because of variations in protocols and analytic techniques, the results vary. When a priori information of the task is known, a model-based technique, such as statistical parametric mapping, is often used for analysis. In the case of acid stimulation of the esophagus the task model is unclear, so we analyzed brain activity during an acid or isotonic saline infusion to the esophagus using independent component analysis (ICA), which does not depend on a priori information of the task.

Central pain mechanisms following combined acid and capsaicin perfusion of the human oesophagus.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ejpain.2009.05.013	Visceral afferents originating from different gut-segments converge at the spinal level. We hypothesized that chemically-induced hyperalgesia in the oesophagus could provoke widespread visceral hypersensitivity and also influence descending modulatory pain pathways. Fifteen healthy volunteers were studied at baseline, 30, 60 and 90 min after randomized perfusion of the distal oesophagus with either saline or 180 ml 0.1M HCl+2mg capsaicin. Electro-stimulation of the oesophagus, 8 cm proximal to the perfusion site, rectosigmoid electrical stimulation and rectal mechanical and heat stimulations were used. Evoked brain potentials were recorded after electrical stimulations before and after oesophageal perfusion. After the perfusion, rectal hyperalgesia to heat (P<0.01, 37%) and mechanical (P=0.01, 11%) stimulations were demonstrated. In contrast, hypoalgesia to electro-stimulation was observed in both the oesophagus (P<0.03, 23%) and the sigmoid colon (P<0.001, 18%). Referred pain areas to electro-stimulation in oesophagus were reduced by 13% after perfusion (P=0.01). Evoked brain potentials to rectosigmoid stimulations showed decreased latencies and amplitudes of P1, N1 and P2 (P<0.05), whereas oesophagus-evoked brain potentials were unaffected after perfusion. In conclusion, modality-specific hyperalgesia was demonstrated in the lower gut following chemical sensitization of the oesophagus, reflecting widespread central hyperexcitability. Conversely, hypoalgesia to electrical stimulation, decreases in referred pain and latencies of evoked brain potentials was seen. This outcome may reflect a counterbalancing activation of descending inhibitory pathways. As these findings are also seen in the clinical setting, the model may be usable for future basic and pharmacological studies.

Cortical changes to experimental sensitization of the human esophagus.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.02.031	Topographical organization in the neocortex shows experience-dependent plasticity. We hypothesized that experimental sensitization of the esophagus results in changes of the topographical distribution of the evoked potentials and the corresponding dipole source activities to painful stimulation. An endoscopic method was used to deliver 35 electrical stimuli at the pain threshold to a fixed area of the mucosa in 10 healthy volunteer men and women. The stimulations were repeated after 30 min (reproducibility experiment), and after 60 min following perfusion of 200 ml 0.1 N hydrochloric acid (sensitization experiment). During stimulation the electroencephalogram was recorded from 64 surface electrodes. The sensitization resulted in a decrease in the pain threshold (F=6.2; P=0.004). The topographic distribution of the evoked potentials showed reproducible negative (N1, N2) and positive (P1, P2) components. After acid perfusion a reduced latency and a change in localization was seen for the P1 subdivided into frontal and occipital components (F=29.5, P<0.001; F=53.7, P<0.001). Furthermore the sensitization resulted in a reduction of the latency for P2 (F=6.2, P=0.009). The source analysis showed consistent dipolar activity in the bilateral opercular-insular cortex before and after acid perfusion. For the anterior cingulate dipole there was a reduction in latency (P=0.03) and a posterior shift (P=0.0002) following acid perfusion. The findings indicate that short-term sensitization of the esophagus results in central neuroplastic changes involving the cingulate gyrus, which also showed pathological activation in functional diseases of the gut, thus reflecting the importance of this region in visceral pain and hyperalgesia.

Characterization of cortical potentials evoked by oesophageal balloon distention and acid perfusion in patients with functional heartburn.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2006.00761.x	Oesophageal visceral hypersensitivity is thought to be important in generating symptoms in functional heartburn (FH). However, the neurophysiological mechanisms involved are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to compare the characteristics of oesophageal cortical evoked potentials (CEPs) induced by balloon distension and acid perfusion in FH and controls. We studied 21 FH patients and 12 healthy volunteers. Oesophageal mechanical stimulation was performed using the specially constructed mechanical pump. CEPs were recorded using the 10-20 international system of electroencephalogram recording. Oesophageal distention elicited recognizable, reproducible and muti-peak CEPs. CEP latencies for N1, P1 and N2 components were significantly shorter (P = 0.016, P = 0.003 and P = 0.031, respectively) in FH than in controls before perfusion. Acid perfusion significantly decreased the latencies of N1, P1 and N2 (P = 0.022, P = 0.007 and P = 0.041, respectively) and significantly increased the amplitude of P1-N2 components (P = 0.020) in FH patients, but not in controls. In conclusion, cortical evoked potential responses evoked by oesophageal distention and acid perfusion were greater in FH than in controls, suggesting that dysfunction of visceral neural pathways and/or alterations in cortical processing may produce and mediate oesophageal hypersensitivity in FH. These findings provide the evidence that central sensitization contributes to the development and maintenance of oesophageal hypersensitivity.

DOI: 10.1007/BF01202380	Previous independent EEG and PET studies suggest that administration of intravenous procaine hydrochloride selectively activates limbic brain structures. To further elucidate procaine's effects and explore the relationship between quantitative EEG (qEEG) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), we simultaneously recorded qEEG and sampled rCBF using O-15 water PET in 20 healthy volunteers during single-blind injections of saline (baseline condition) followed by intravenous procaine (1.84 mg/kg). After thorough screening of EEG records, a subgroup of 7 subjects with EEG data relatively free of both muscle and movement artifacts was selected for analysis. Quantitative spectral EEG data from right occipital and temporal leads were then correlated with each subject's PET rCBF values on a pixel by pixel basis, both at baseline and after procaine. The most striking finding was that the increases in occipital and temporal omega activity from baseline to procaine positively correlated with rCBF increases in the amygdala and its efferents (p < .05), in a pattern very similar to the rCBF increases seen after procaine administration. This suggests that omega activity may reflect activation of deeper brain limbic structures. Also, the convergence of EEG and PET data further supports procaine's selective limbic activation.

Effects of Vortioxetine and Escitalopram on Electroencephalographic Recordings - A Randomized, Crossover Trial in Healthy Males.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2019.09.039	The antidepressant drug vortioxetine has a multimodal action modulating neurotransmission through inhibition of the serotonin transporter and modulation of serotonin receptors. Vortioxetine has also been shown to alleviate cognitive symptoms in preclinical studies and in patients with depression. However, it is largely unclear how vortioxetine affects the brain processing in humans. The present study was conducted in 32 healthy males in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, active comparator, four-way crossover design. Treatments were 10 and 20 mg/day vortioxetine, 15 mg/day escitalopram, and placebo, administered orally once daily for three days. Results were compared to placebo. Treatment effect was assessed by recording spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and 40 Hz auditory steady state responses. For the spontaneous EEG, both vortioxetine and escitalopram decreased the frequency content in the theta band (4-8 Hz) and increased power in the beta (12-32 Hz) and gamma (32-45 Hz) bands. Vortioxetine and escitalopram decreased connectivity during rest in the theta band and increased connectivity in the gamma bands. Finally, both treatments caused decreased power in the evoked gamma band in response to 40 Hz auditory stimulation. Although the global EEG changes were comparable between vortioxetine and escitalopram, subtle differences between treatment effects on the EEG in terms of effect size and regional distribution of the EEG changes were apparent. To our knowledge, the current results are the first data on how vortioxetine affects EEG in humans. The present study calls for further investigations addressing the possible electrophysiological and cognitive effects of vortioxetine.

Pre-intervention test-retest reliability of EEG and ERP over four recording intervals.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2018.09.007	In this study we present the test-retest reliability of pre-intervention EEG/ERP (electroencephalogram/event-related potentials) data across four recording intervals separated by a washout period (18-22 days). POz-recording-reference EEG/ERP (28 sites, average reference) were recorded from thirty-two healthy male participants. Participants were randomly allocated into different intervention sequences, each with four intervention regimens: 10 mg vortioxetine, 20 mg vortioxetine, 15 mg escitalopram and Placebo. We report classical EEG spectra: δ (1-4 Hz), θ (4-8 Hz), α (8-12 Hz), β (12-30 Hz), γ1 (30-45 Hz) and γ2 (45-80 Hz) of resting state and vigilance-controlled, and of auditory steady state response, as well as ERP components N100, P200 and P300 in auditory oddball task and error related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) in hybrid flanker task. Reliability was quantified using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). We found that θ, α and β of continuous EEG were highly reliable (ICCs ≥ 0.84). Evoked power of other tasks demonstrated larger variability and less reliability compared to the absolute power of continuous EEG. Furthermore, reliabilities of ERP measures were lower compared to those of the EEG spectra. We saw fair to excellent reliability of the amplitude of the components such as Pe (0.60-0.82) and P300 (0.55-0.80). Moreover, blood tests confirmed that there was no measurable drug carry-over from the previous intervention. The results support that EEG/ERP is reliable across four recording intervals, thus it can be used to assess the effect of different doses and types of drugs with CNS effects.

Central nervous system involvement in gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina with hyperornithinaemia.	DOI: 10.1023/a:1005602405349	In gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina with hyperornithinaemia (GA), a genetically determined deficiency of ornithine delta-aminotransferase activity leads to high ornithine concentrations in body fluids. GA is characterized by centripetally progressing retinal and choroidal destruction and selective atrophy with tubular aggregates in type II skeletal muscle fibres. These findings have been suggested to be mediated by hyperornithinaemia-induced deficiency of high-energy creatine phosphate. As abnormal brain magnetic resonance images and electroencephalograms are found in another disorder of creatine metabolism, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency, we investigated the central nervous system involvement in GA, which seems to be associated with a milder degree of phosphocreatine deficiency. We compared 23 untreated GA patients with age-matched healthy controls, and with 9 patients who had received creatine or creatine precursor supplementation daily for several years. The mean age of the patients (32 +/- 18 years) was similar to that of the controls (36 +/- 22 years). The MRI or EEG findings of the patients on creatine supplementation did not differ from those of the untreated group. Brain MRI revealed degenerative lesions in the white matter in 50% of the GA patients, and 70% of the patients had premature atrophic changes, with a striking increase in the number of Virchow's spaces. Of the patients whose EEG was recorded, 58% had abnormal slow background activity, focal lesions or high-amplitude beta rhythm (> 50 microV). The EEG findings were not associated with the MRI changes or with the age or the sex of the patients. Early degenerative and atrophic brain changes and abnormal EEG are thus features of GA, in addition to the well-characterized eye and muscle manifestations.

Dose effects of temazepam in transient insomnia.		"A transient insomnia model, the ""first night"" effect in the sleep laboratory, was used to assess the dose range for the hypnotic and sleep stage effects of temazepam. 201 healthy, normal subjects (97 men and 104 women), 21 to 49 years old, with no sleep complaints were studied. Each was randomly assigned to receive either placebo, 7.5, 15, or 30 mg temazepam hard gelatin capsules (Restoril) administered double-blind 30 min before bedtime on their first night in the sleep laboratory. Over the 8-h polysomnogram total sleep time and sleep efficiency increased significantly in a linear fashion with increasing doses of temazepam. Sleep tendency was significantly reduced by increasing doses again in a linear manner. Wake time during the sleep period was reduced significantly only by the higher dose. The percentage of stage 1 sleep was reduced and the percentage of stage 2 sleep was increased, each linearly with increasing doses. These data are the first to demonstrate the hypnotic effects of a 7.5 mg dose of temazepam and also support previous studies of 15 and 30 mg temazepam administered to chronic insomniacs. They also illustrate the utility of the ""first night"" effect as a model of transient insomnia."

Effects of oral temazepam on slow waves during non-rapid eye movement sleep in healthy young adults: A high-density EEG investigation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2016.01.003	Slow waves are characteristic waveforms that occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep that play an integral role in sleep quality and brain plasticity. Benzodiazepines are commonly used medications that alter slow waves, however, their effects may depend on the time of night and measure used to characterize slow waves. Prior investigations have utilized minimal scalp derivations to evaluate the effects of benzodiazepines on slow waves, and thus the topography of changes to slow waves induced by benzodiazepines has yet to be fully elucidated. This study used high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) to evaluate the effects of oral temazepam on slow wave activity, incidence, and morphology during NREM sleep in 18 healthy adults relative to placebo. Temazepam was associated with significant decreases in slow wave activity and incidence, which were most prominent in the latter portions of the sleep period. However, temazepam was also associated with a decrease in the magnitude of high-amplitude slow waves and their slopes in the first NREM sleep episode, which was most prominent in frontal derivations. These findings suggest that benzodiazepines produce changes in slow waves throughout the night that vary depending on cortical topography and measures used to characterize slow waves. Further research that explores the relationships between benzodiazepine-induced changes to slow waves and the functional effects of these waveforms is indicated.

Randomised clinical trial of the effects of prolonged-release melatonin, temazepam and zolpidem on slow-wave activity during sleep in healthy people.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881115581963	Current pharmacological treatments for insomnia include benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics targeting γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors, as well as agonists of the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2. Melatonin, temazepam and zolpidem are thought to exert their effect through different mechanisms of action, but whether this leads to differential effects on electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra during sleep in middle-aged people is currently not known. To establish whether the effects of prolonged-release melatonin (2 mg) on the nocturnal sleep EEG are different to those of temazepam (20 mg) and zolpidem (10 mg). Sixteen healthy men and women aged 55-64 years participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way cross-over trial. Nocturnal sleep was assessed with polysomnography and spectral analysis of the EEG. The effects of single oral doses of prolonged-release melatonin, temazepam and zolpidem on EEG slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.75-4.5 Hz) and other frequencies during nocturnal non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were compared. In an entire night analysis prolonged-release melatonin did not affect SWA, whereas temazepam and zolpidem significantly reduced SWA compared with placebo. Temazepam significantly reduced SWA compared with prolonged-release melatonin. Prolonged-release melatonin only reduced SWA during the first third of the night compared with placebo. These data show that the effects of prolonged-release melatonin on the nocturnal sleep EEG are minor and are different from those of temazepam and zolpidem; this is likely due to the different mechanisms of action of the medications.

Benzodiazepine temazepam suppresses the transient auditory 40-Hz response amplitude in humans.	DOI: 10.1016/s0304-3940(99)00393-6	To discern the role of the GABA(A) receptors in the generation and attentive modulation of the transient auditory 40-Hz response, the effects of the benzodiazepine temazepam (10 mg) were studied in 10 healthy social drinkers, using a double-blind placebo-controlled design. Three hundred Hertz standard and 330 Hz rare deviant tones were presented to the left, and 1000 Hz standards and 1100 Hz deviants to the right ear of the subjects. Subjects attended to a designated ear and were to detect deviants therein while ignoring tones to the other. Temazepam significantly suppressed the amplitude of the 40-Hz response, the effect being equal for attended and non-attended tone responses. This suggests involvement of GABA(A) receptors in transient auditory 40-Hz response generation, however, not in the attentive modulation of the 40-Hz response.

Effects of oral temazepam on sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement sleep: A high-density EEG investigation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.06.005	Benzodiazepines are commonly used medications that alter sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, however the topographic changes to these functionally significant waveforms have yet to be fully elucidated. This study utilized high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) to investigate topographic changes in sleep spindles and spindle-range activity caused by temazepam during NREM sleep in 18 healthy adults. After an accommodation night, sleep for all participants was recorded on two separate nights after taking either placebo or oral temazepam 15 mg. Sleep was monitored using 256-channel hdEEG. Spectral analysis and spindle waveform detection of sleep EEG data were performed for each participant night. Global and topographic data were subsequently compared between temazepam and placebo conditions. Temazepam was associated with significant increases in spectral power from 10.33 to 13.83 Hz. Within this frequency band, temazepam broadly increased sleep spindle duration, and topographically increased spindle amplitude and density in frontal and central-posterior regions, respectively. Higher frequency sleep spindles demonstrated increased spindle amplitude and a paradoxical decrease in spindle density in frontal and centroparietal regions. Further analysis demonstrated temazepam both slowed the average frequency of spindle waveforms and increased the relative proportion of spindles at peak frequencies in frontal and centroparietal regions. These findings suggest that benzodiazepines have diverse effects on sleep spindles that vary by frequency and cortical topography. Further research that explores the relationships between topographic and frequency-dependent changes in pharmacologically-induced sleep spindles and the functional effects of these waveforms is indicated.

Effects of hypnotics on the sleep EEG of healthy young adults: new data and psychopharmacologic implications.	DOI: 10.1016/s0022-3956(00)00038-8	"Benzodiazepine hypnotics increase NREM sleep and alter its EEG by reducing delta (0.3-3 Hz) and increasing sigma (12-15 Hz) and beta (15-23 Hz) activity. We tested whether the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, zolpidem (10 mg), produced the same pattern of sleep and EEG changes as two ""classical"" benzodiazepines, triazolam (0.25 mg) and temazepam (30 mg). Sleep EEG of 16 subjects was analyzed with period amplitude analysis for 3 nights during drug administration or placebo. The effects of zolpidem were in the same direction but generally of smaller magnitude than those of the classical benzodiazepines. These differences are more likely the result of non-equivalent dosages than different pharmacologic actions. Period amplitude analysis showed that the decreased delta activity resulted mainly from a decrease in wave amplitude. In contrast, the increased sigma and beta activity were produced by increased wave incidence. Delta suppression increased with repeated drug administration but sigma and beta stimulation did not. While these findings have little relevance for the clinical choice of hypnotics they may hold important implications for the brain mechanisms involved in hypnotic tolerance and withdrawal delirium."

DOI: 10.1016/j.jns.2013.09.027	The purpose of this study is to consider the clinical utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and find a correlation with VEP. Effects of different disease modifying treatments (DMT) were further evaluated by measuring OCT parameters and whether a correlation exists between the RNFL thickness, disease duration and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) were also assessed. 13 patients were on interferon beta-1a (IFN), 14 patients were receiving glatiramer acetate (GA), 19 patients were not being treated with any DMT and 21 healthy controls were included the study. During OCT examination, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness was found to be lower in all MS groups but macular volume (MV) was lower only in GA group than controls. Although, P100 latencies were longer than controls in all MS groups, there was no statistically significant difference between IFN and w/o DMT groups. Patients with ON history, P100 latencies were found significantly longer than those without ON. VEP amplitudes were found lower with ON history patients than those without ON, however this was not statistically significant.

Our results show that RNFL, GCC and MV were all decreased in MS patients with or without DMT comparing to controls and it is more prominent in eyes with ON.

Pharmacological Elevation of Catecholamine Levels Improves Perceptual Decisions, But Not Metacognitive Insight.	DOI: 10.1523/ENEURO.0019-24.2024	Perceptual decisions are often accompanied by a feeling of decision confidence. Where the parietal cortex is known for its crucial role in shaping such perceptual decisions, metacognitive evaluations are thought to additionally rely on the (pre)frontal cortex. Because of this supposed neural differentiation between these processes, perceptual and metacognitive decisions may be divergently affected by changes in internal (e.g., attention, arousal) and external (e.g., task and environmental demands) factors. Although intriguing, causal evidence for this hypothesis remains scarce. Here, we investigated the causal effect of two neuromodulatory systems on behavioral and neural measures of perceptual and metacognitive decision-making. Specifically, we pharmacologically elevated levels of catecholamines (with atomoxetine) and acetylcholine (with donepezil) in healthy adult human participants performing a visual discrimination task in which we gauged decision confidence, while electroencephalography was measured. Where cholinergic effects were not robust, catecholaminergic enhancement improved perceptual sensitivity, while at the same time leaving metacognitive sensitivity unaffected. Neurally, catecholaminergic elevation did not affect sensory representations of task-relevant visual stimuli but instead enhanced well-known decision signals measured over the centroparietal cortex, reflecting the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Crucially, catecholaminergic enhancement concurrently impoverished neural markers measured over the frontal cortex linked to the formation of metacognitive evaluations. Enhanced catecholaminergic neuromodulation thus improves perceptual but not metacognitive decision-making.

Pharmacological Manipulations of Physiological Arousal and Sleep-Like Slow Waves Modulate Sustained Attention.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0836-22.2022	Sustained attention describes our ability to keep a constant focus on a given task. This ability is modulated by our physiological state of arousal. Although lapses of sustained attention have been linked with dysregulations of arousal, the underlying physiological mechanisms remain unclear. An emerging body of work proposes that the intrusion during wakefulness of sleep-like slow waves, a marker of the transition toward sleep, could mechanistically account for attentional lapses. This study aimed to expose, via pharmacological manipulations of the monoamine system, the relationship between the occurrence of sleep-like slow waves and the behavioral consequences of sustained attention failures. In a double-blind, randomized-control trial, 32 healthy human male participants received methylphenidate, atomoxetine, citalopram or placebo during four separate experimental sessions. During each session, electroencephalography (EEG) was used to measure neural activity while participants completed a visual task requiring sustained attention. Methylphenidate, which increases wake-promoting dopamine and noradrenaline across cortical and subcortical areas, improved behavioral performance whereas atomoxetine, which increases dopamine and noradrenaline predominantly over frontal cortices, led to more impulsive responses. Additionally, citalopram, which increases sleep-promoting serotonin, led to more missed trials. Based on EEG recording, citalopram was also associated with an increase in sleep-like slow waves. Importantly, compared with a classical marker of arousal such as α power, only slow waves differentially predicted both misses and faster responses in a region-specific fashion. These results suggest that a decrease in arousal can lead to local sleep intrusions during wakefulness which could be mechanistically linked to impulsivity and sluggishness.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We investigated whether the modulation of attention and arousal could not only share the same neuromodulatory pathways but also rely on similar neuronal mechanisms; for example, the intrusion of sleep-like activity within wakefulness. To do so, we pharmacologically manipulated noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin in a four-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled trial and examined the consequences on behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) indices of attention and arousal. We showed that sleep-like slow waves can predict opposite behavioral signatures: impulsivity and sluggishness. Slow waves may be a candidate mechanism for the occurrence of attentional lapses since the relationship between slow-wave occurrence and performance is region-specific and the consequences of these local sleep intrusions are in line with the cognitive functions carried by the underlying brain regions.

Combining Topical Agonists With the Recording of Event-Related Brain Potentials to Probe the Functional Involvement of TRPM8, TRPA1 and TRPV1 in Heat and Cold Transduction in the Human Skin.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpain.2021.11.008	TRP channels play a central role in the transduction of thermal and nociceptive stimuli by free nerve endings. Most of the research on these channels has been conducted in vitro or in vivo in nonhuman animals and translation of these results to humans must account for potential experimental biases and interspecific differences. This study aimed at evaluating the involvement of TRPM8, TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels in the transduction of heat and cold stimuli by the human thermonociceptive system. For this purpose, we evaluated the effects of topical agonists of these 3 channels (menthol, cinnamaldehyde and capsaicin) on the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by phasic thermal stimuli (target temperatures: 10°C, 42°C, and 60°C) selected to activate cold Aδ thermoreceptors, warm sensitive C thermoreceptors and heat sensitive Aδ polymodal nociceptors. Sixty-four participants were recruited, 16 allocated to each agonist solution group (20% menthol, 10% cinnamaldehyde, .025% capsaicin and 1% capsaicin). Participants were treated sequentially with the active solution on one forearm and vehicle only on the other forearm for 20 minutes. Menthol decreased the amplitude and increased the latency of cold and heat ERPs. Cinnamic aldehyde decreased the amplitude and increased the latency of heat but not cold ERPs. Capsaicin decreased the amplitude and increased the latency of heat ERPs and decreased the amplitude of the N2P2 complex of the cold ERPs without affecting the earlier N1 wave or the latencies of the peaks. These findings are compatible with previous evidence indicating that TRPM8 is involved in innocuous cold transduction and that TRPV1 and TRPA1 are involved in noxious heat transduction in humans. PERSPECTIVE: By chemically modulating TRPM8, TRPA1 and TRPV1 reactivity (key molecules in the transduction of temperature) and assessing how this affected EEG responses to the activation of cold thermoreceptors and heat nociceptors, we aimed at confirming the role of these channels in a functional healthy human model.

A novel human volunteer pain model using contact heat evoked potentials (CHEP) following topical skin application of transient receptor potential agonists capsaicin, menthol and cinnamaldehyde.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jocn.2010.11.015	The discovery of transient receptor potential (TRP) receptors has advanced understanding of temperature sensation, and pre-clinical studies have identified TRP as major novel analgesic targets in inflammatory and neuropathic pain states. We systematically investigated the sensory effects and interactions of TRP agonists capsaicin (TRPV1), menthol (TRPM8) and cinnamaldehyde (TRPA1) applied topically to the skin in 14 healthy human participants. Capsaicin lowered heat pain thresholds while warm detection thresholds were unchanged, suggesting an effect purely on nociceptor nerve fibres. The amplitude of contact heat-evoked potentials (CHEP) and evoked pain ratings were negatively correlated after capsaicin, whereas CHEP had been correlated positively without capsaicin in a previous volunteer study. Menthol caused cold hypersensitivity and cinnamaldehyde caused heat hypersensitivity, but neither had an effect on evoked potentials. The CHEP after application of capsaicin show features observed in some patients with painful neuropathy, and could provide a model for development of novel analgesics, particularly TRPV1 antagonists.

Microstructure of the non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalogram in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease: effects of dopaminergic treatment.	DOI: 10.1002/mds.10242	We investigated non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease (PD) who had never previously received dopaminergic medication. There were no significant differences in the conventional sleep parameters between de novo patients with PD and a healthy control group, but the length of stage 1 sleep and the number of awakenings increased significantly upon administration of dopaminergic drugs. Analyzing the quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG), we observed a significant reduction in the low-delta frequency range and a nonsignificant increase in the sigma frequency range in de novo patients with PD. The dopaminergic medication also nonsignificantly reduced the low-delta and sigma frequencies, the latter to the level of the controls. Possible mechanisms that may account for the observed differences are discussed. It is suggested that Parkinson's disease as well as the application of dopaminergic drugs exerts a desynchronizing effect on the sleep EEG that is reflected in a disruption of sleep continuity.

Sleep endocrine effects of megestrol acetate in healthy men.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-2826.1998.00259.x	Synthetic and naturally occurring steroids exert a variety of neural effects that include modulation of nocturnal sleep. The present study focuses on the effect of progesterone receptor (PR) activation on the nocturnal sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) in male volunteers. As a PR ligand, the synthetic progesterone megestrol was used, which has the advantage over progesterone in that it is not metabolized into other steroid compounds which could cloud the progesterone-mediated effects through their own neuroactive properties. Nine healthy male volunteers were investigated in a prospective single-blind randomized study design. They received either placebo tablets or megestrol acetate dosages of 160, 320 or 480 mg at 14.00 h and 19.00 h. Blood samples were drawn half-hourly from 22.00 h until 07.00 h. After 320 mg megestrol, plasma adrenocorticotropin secretion was lower and growth hormone secretion was higher than after 160 mg and 480 mg megestrol or placebo. Similarly, the reduction in the relative amount of rapid eye movement sleep was most pronounced after 320 mg. Thus, progesterone receptor activation, as reflected by the sleep EEG and associated pituitary hormone secretion, follows a nonlinear U-shape dose dependency of a well-defined PR ligand, which may explain the unresolved inconsistencies of neuroendocrine progesterone effects to date. Moreover, employing a CV1 cell line, contransfected with a human glucocorticoid receptor expression vector and a reporter gene-based detection system for transcriptional activity, revealed that a PR agonist such as megestrol may also activate glucocorticoid receptors. This may account for some of the neuroendocrine effects of megestrol and other progestins.

Effects of Rifaximin on Central Responses to Social Stress-a Pilot Experiment.	DOI: 10.1007/s13311-018-0627-2	Probiotics that promote the gut microbiota have been reported to reduce stress responses, and improve memory and mood. Whether and how antibiotics that eliminate or inhibit pathogenic and commensal gut bacteria also affect central nervous system functions in humans is so far unknown. In a double-blinded randomized study, 16 healthy volunteers (27.00 ± 1.60 years; 9 males) received either rifaximin (600 mg/day) (a poorly absorbable antibiotic) or placebo for 7 days. Before and after the drug intervention, brain activities during rest and during a social stressor inducing feelings of exclusion (Cyberball game) were measured using magnetoencephalography. Social exclusion significantly affected (p < 0.001) mood and increased exclusion perception. Magnetoencephalography showed brain regions with higher activations during exclusion as compared to inclusion, in different frequency bands. Seven days of rifaximin increased prefrontal and right cingulate alpha power during resting state. Low beta power showed an interaction of intervention (rifaximin, placebo) × condition (inclusion, exclusion) during the Cyberball game in the bilateral prefrontal and left anterior cingulate cortex. Only in the rifaximin group, a decrease (p = 0.004) in power was seen comparing exclusion to inclusion; the reduced beta-1 power was negatively correlated with a change in the subjective exclusion perception score. Social stress affecting brain functioning in a specific manner is modulated by rifaximin. Contrary to our hypothesis that antibiotics have advert effects on mood, the antibiotic exhibited stress-reducing effects similar to reported effects of probiotics (supported by NeuroGUT, a EU 7th Framework Programme ITN no. 607652; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier number NCT02793193).

Propranolol selectively blocks the enhanced parietal old/new effect during long-term recollection of unpleasant pictures: a high density ERP study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.025	Evidence from both animal and human research suggests that the formation of emotional memories is triggered by the beta-adrenergic system. To confirm whether modulation of central beta-adrenergic transmission is specifically involved in the neural signature of memory performance, the pre-encoding effect of propranolol (80 mg) on event-related potentials (ERPs) was measured in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study in 46 male healthy subjects using high density EEG and source imaging analysis during encoding and retrieval (after 1 week) of IAPS pictures of unpleasant, neutral and pleasant contents; for recognition 90 old pictures were randomly mixed with 90 new pictures. During retrieval correctly remembered old pictures elicited a significantly larger positive voltage change over the centro-parietal cortex than new pictures. Propranolol significantly reduced this old/new difference of the mean ERP amplitudes (500-800 ms) for unpleasant but not for neutral and pleasant memories. This effect correlated with salivary alpha-amylase activity, a surrogate for central adrenergic stimulation. In conclusion, propranolol selectively blocked the neural signature of unpleasant memories by mechanisms in which the parietal cortex seems to be specifically involved.

Beta blocker effects on heart rate during sleep: a placebo-controlled polysomnographic study with normotensive males.	DOI: 10.1093/sleep/14.1.43	Although the effect of beta blockers on heart rate (HR) at rest, during exercise, and by ambulatory electrocardiography during the day and night has been studied extensively, data on the effect of these drugs on heart rate during the various stages of sleep are not available. We performed overnight polysomnography and exercise testing in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Latin square crossover study of four beta blockers with different ancillary properties (atenolol 100 mg daily, metoprolol 100 mg, pindolol 10 mg, and propranolol 80 mg), on 30 healthy men aged 23-40 years (29.4 +/- 4.3) (mean +/- SD). At rest pindolol increased HR by 4.7 beats/min +/- 13.1 (p less than 0.05), while beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) decreased HR (p less than 0.0001) by 6.1 +/- 8.8 (atenolol), 5.8 +/- 8.4 (propranolol), and 5.0 +/- 9.4 (metoprolol). Exercise at 125 W increased HR on placebo by 76.4 +/- 18.4 beats. Compared to placebo all beta blockers were associated with lower (p less than 0.0001) exercise HR by 18.3 +/- 23.2 atenolol, 21.1 +/- 15.5 metoprolol, 16.8 +/- 14.1 pindolol, and 20.8 +/- 13.1 propranolol [not significant (NS) among beta blockers]. Thus the effect of beta blockers on heart rate was magnified during exercise.

Peripheral and central control of swallowing initiation in healthy humans.	DOI: 10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.08.003	We investigated (1) how peripheral inputs might assist central inputs in the control of voluntary evoked swallowing, (2) inter-individual variation in involuntary and voluntary swallowing initiation, and (3) whether natural chewing behavior affects the initiation of involuntary swallowing in healthy humans. Eleven participants completed a repetitive saliva swallowing test (RSST), chewing test (CHEW), and rest period (REST). In RSST, participants repetitively swallowed as quickly as possible. In CHEW, subjects chewed gum freely. We delivered pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PEStim) to the laryngopharynx and compared the number of swallows that occurred with and without PEStim. PEStim significantly increased the number of voluntary evoked swallows in RSST, as well as the number of swallows in CHEW and REST trials, although this facilitatory effect was larger in REST trials. We found a positive correlation between the number of swallows at RSST without PEStim and that at REST with PEStim within individuals. Additionally, we found a significant positive correlation between the number of swallows at RSST with PEStim and the sum of that at RSST without PEStim and at REST with PES. Based on the current results, we suggest that (1) peripheral inputs within a certain range appear to facilitate the central inputs that control voluntary swallowing, (2) inter-individual variations in swallowing initiation may arise from differences in the excitability of the common neural network in the lower brainstem, and (3) during chewing, food reduction in the oral cavity is prioritized, such that the neural network associated with chewing may regulate swallowing initiation.

The cortical representation of somatosensory evoked potentials of the phrenic nerve.		Respiratory electrophysiological studies are of essential value in diagnosing and managing patients with respiratory failure, but assessment of the sensory phrenic nerve fibres has been neglected. We recorded phrenic nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) by combining neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques in three healthy subjects. Evoked potentials of the phrenic nerve showed the highest amplitude at CP3, determined by the modified 10-20 EEG system, and occurred at a constant latency, PI at 12.0 +/- 0.6 ms, and NI at 17.3 +/- 0.8 ms. Single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) performed during phrenic nerve stimulation revealed focal neuronal activation in the somatosensory pathways. Intravenously administered Tc-99m Ethyl Cysteinate Dimer (ECD) was used as a blood flow tracer to obtain baseline and activated images. After image registration, baseline images were compared voxel-by-voxel with the activation images. The mean inter-subject summation image of the activated state was compared with that of the baseline state using ten normal subjects. The extent of the total voxel volume increase on the mean images of the 3 activated SPECT images was 0.7%, and a mean signal increase of 22%. For further anatomic localization of regional increases in signal, the magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan of each subject was registered and superimposed on the activated stage SPECT image. This method may be used clinically to study the pathophysiology of impaired central respiratory drive.

Corticomuscular coherence during bilateral isometric arm voluntary activity in healthy humans.	DOI: 10.1152/jn.00722.2011	Bilateral voluntary contractions involve functional changes in both primary motor cortices. We investigated whether a voluntary contraction controlled by one hemisphere can influence oscillatory processes contralaterally. Corticomuscular coherence was calculated between EEG recorded over the motor cortex hand representation and electromyogram from the first dorsal interosseous muscle when the nondominant hand performed a precision grip task. The dominant arm remained at rest or performed a finger abduction or an elbow flexion task at 10, 40, and 70% of maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC). Mean coherence in the 15- to 30-Hz range in the hand performing a precision grip increased during 40% (by 72%) and 70% (by 73%) but not during 10% of MVC in the finger abduction task. Similarly, in the elbow flexion task, mean coherence increased during 40% (by 40%) and 70% (by 48%) but not during 10% of MVC. No differences were observed between the increments in coherence between the finger abduction and elbow flexion tasks at a given force level. We speculate that these results reflect the increased complexity of controlling a fine motor task with one hand while performing a strong contraction with the contralateral hand and suggest that increased oscillatory corticomuscular coupling may contribute to successful task performance.

DOI: 10.1097/WNP.0b013e31803bb334	The authors compared cognitive changes in epilepsy patients with or without antiepileptic drugs using event-related potential (ERP) N270 and P300. The patients were divided into three groups according to treatment type: carbamazepine, valproate acid (VPA), or no treatment. One control group composed of healthy subjects was included. The Mini-Mental State Examination detected no clinical dementia in all subjects. A modified Sternberg paradigm was used as a task when an ERP was recorded. When a stimulus was different from the memorized item (conflict condition), N270 was elicited in both controls and patients. All the three patient groups showed a delayed and smaller N270 than the control group. P300 was elicited when a stimulus was the same one as the memorized item (match condition), and its amplitude decreased in the VPA group. P300 latency did not differ among the four groups. ERP (N270 and P300) was abnormal in patients with epilepsy. These results indicate that antiepileptic drugs, especially VPA, might enhance the impairment of cognitive processing. N270 is more sensitive than P300 in the early detection of minor cognitive impairment in epileptics.

Effects of antiepileptic drugs on EEG background activity in children with epilepsy: initial phase of therapy.	DOI: 10.1177/155005949502600209	The effects of antiepileptic drugs (AED) on EEG background activity were evaluated in 37 newly treated children with epilepsy, compared with 46 age-matched healthy controls. Before AED therapy, the children with epilepsy, both partial (treated with carbamazepine, CBZ group) and generalized seizures (treated with valproic acid, VPA group), already exhibited significant slowing of EEG with increased delta and decreased alpha power. Following 3 to 6 months of AED therapy, this EEG slowing was enhanced in the CBZ group and reduced in the VPA group. Following 1 year of AED therapy, an increase in frequency was recognized in the CBZ group. These results suggest that 1) most children with epilepsy already exhibit slowing of the EEG at the onset of seizures, which may reflect CNS developmental deficit, 2) the short-term effects on EEG are different between CBZ and VPA, and 3) EEG development with age continues under continuous AED administration. The EEG background activity in children with epilepsy is affected by many factors, which include the underlying CNS dysfunction of the epilepsy itself and also AED therapy (type of AEDs, duration of therapy, etc).

The effect of carbamazepine on human corticomuscular coherence.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.12.040	EEG recordings from motor cortex show oscillations at approximately 10 and 20 Hz. The 20-Hz oscillations are coherent with contralateral EMG; in most studies those at 10 Hz are not. However, significant 10-Hz coherence has recently been reported in a group of epileptic patients, all of whom were taking the anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine (CBZ). In a double blind study, we investigated the effects of CBZ on corticomuscular coherence in eight healthy human subjects (all male). Subjects performed a precision grip task against an auxotonic load, whilst left sensorimotor EEG and EMGs from five muscles in the right hand and forearm were recorded. CBZ (100 mg) or a placebo was then given orally, and 6 h later subjects were re-tested. One week separated CBZ and placebo experiments in each subject. Coherence averaged across subjects and muscles during the hold phase of the task was maximal at 21 Hz; it increased significantly (P < 0.05, Z-test) by 89% after CBZ administration. This was significantly greater than a much smaller increase following placebo, which itself may reflect an effect of the time of day when experiments were performed. There was no significant approximately 10-Hz coherence either before or after CBZ administration. CBZ did not significantly alter EEG power at either 10 or 20 Hz. Recently, we showed that diazepam markedly increases the power of approximately 20-Hz motor cortical oscillations with little effect on coherence. We show here that CBZ raises coherence without altering EEG power. This pharmacological dissociation may indicate an important role for corticomuscular coherence in motor control.

Differential effects on fast and slow spindle activity, and the sleep slow oscillation in humans with carbamazepine and flunarizine to antagonize voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+ channel activity.	DOI: 10.5665/sleep.2722	Sleep spindles play an important functional role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. They are a hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and are grouped by the sleep slow oscillation. Spindles are not a unitary phenomenon but are differentiated by oscillatory frequency and topography. Yet, it is still a matter of debate whether these differences relate to different generating mechanisms. As corticothalamic networks are known to be involved in the generation of spindles and the slow oscillation, with Ca2+ and Na+ conductances playing crucial roles, we employed the actions of carbamazepine and flunarizine to reduce the efficacy of Na+ and Ca2+ channels, respectively, for probing in healthy human subjects mechanisms of corticothalamocortical excitability.

Quantitative pharmaco-EEG of carbamazepine in volunteers and epileptics.	DOI: 10.1177/155005949602700107	In order to measure the effect of carbamazepine (CBZ) on quantitative EEG (qEEG), one dose of CBZ (300 mg) was administered to 10 epileptics and 10 healthy adult volunteers. EEG samples were recorded before and at regular intervals within 24 hours following administration. The EEG activity was processed by power spectral analysis and the drug serum concentration was assessed concomitantly. The results showed that with the increase of serum concentration of CBZ, the percentage of power progressively increased in the theta band while it decreased in the alpha 2 band. The percentage of theta and alpha 2 power was found to reach maximum and minimum levels, respectively, when the peak values of serum concentration of CBZ were attained. The effects on qEEG in anterior scalp areas were more evident than in posterior scalp areas.

Changes in color vision after a single dose of vigabatrin or carbamazepine in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1097/00002826-200101000-00005	In patients with epilepsy the older antiepileptic drugs induce distinct electroencephalographic changes and may also alter visual function. Although the effects of the newer antiepileptic drugs on the electroencephalogram remain less clear, long-term treatment with vigabatrin (VGB) has been reported to induce severe and permanent visual impairment. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of a single oral dose of VGB and carbamazepine (CBZ) on visual function in normal healthy volunteers randomly assigned to three groups according to a single-blind, placebo-controlled design. All subjects underwent color visual evoked potential tests and color perimetry at baseline and after receiving placebo, VGB (2,000 mg) or CBZ (400 mg). Whereas CBZ induced a mild overall impairment of the chromatic and achromatic systems, VGB induced a selective blue impairment. The differential changes the two antiepileptic drugs induced in visual tests presumably depend on their different mechanisms of action. The selective blue impairment in color visual tests in VGB-treated healthy subjects is consistent with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibition also at retinal level. Hence, color visual tests may be suitable to detect initial visual abnormalities in VGB-treated patients with epilepsy.

Increased cardiac stiffness is associated with autonomic dysfunction in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1111/epi.14084	Autonomic dysfunction is linked to sudden death regardless of the presence of structural heart disease. The pathway from autonomic dysfunction to sudden death is not fully understood, but myocardial sympathetic stimulation leading to arrhythmia and/or cardiac fibrosis might play a role. Our goal was to evaluate cardiac stiffness by echocardiography and its association with clinical, structural, and autonomic variables in people with epilepsy (PWE) compared to healthy controls. A 12-lead electrocardiogram, treadmill testing, and transthoracic echocardiography from 30 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) without any known cardiovascular disorders were compared to 30 individuals without epilepsy matched by sex, age, and body mass index. Distribution of cardiovascular risk factors was similar in both groups. PWE had a higher left ventricle stiffness, left ventricle filling pressure, and greater left atrial volume as well as markers of autonomic dysfunction such as impaired chronotropic index and percentage achieved of predicted peak heart rate at effort. In multiple regressions, autonomic dysfunction explained 52% of stiffness and carbamazepine treatment and polytherapy with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) explained, additionally, 6% each. Stiffness is increased in young patients with TLE and is related to autonomic dysfunction and to a lesser extent, carbamazepine use and polytherapy with AEDs.

Differential effects of first antiepileptic drug application on cognition in lesional and non-lesional patients with epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1016/s1059-1311(05)80115-3	It has been shown that carbamazepine (CBZ) and valproic acid (VPA) have no significant negative or even positive side effects upon cognition in patients with epilepsy. The present study evaluated cognitive effects of CBZ or VPA in 16 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Twelve patients had complex partial seizures, four patients primarily generalized seizures. Special attention was directed towards seizure type, presence of structural lesions and seizure control. Neuropsychological testing was carried out prior to medication and when drugs were within therapeutic ranges. Nineteen untreated healthy subjects served as controls. The following results were obtained: first of all, no general effect of antiepileptic drugs upon cognition could be detected. Only a subgroup with lesion (n = 8) and pre-existing cognitive deficits showed a significant decrease in memory performance during medication. This group additionally obtained poor seizure control. In conclusion, adverse cognitive changes under medication cannot be explained by antiepileptic drugs alone. The presence of cerebral lesions and obtained seizure control have to be considered as essential risk factors.

Memory and psychomotor effects of oxcarbazepine in healthy human volunteers.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02440853	Cognitive and psychomotor impairments can be unwanted adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs. The present double-blind, cross-over study with healthy volunteers was designed to assess the effects of two doses of oxcarbazepine (OXCZ) (150 mg b.i.d.; 300 mg b.i.d.) and a placebo, each given over a two week period. Twelve subjects completed a battery of tests before and 4 h after morning doses on days 1, 8 and 15. Results of objective tests indicated that OXCZ improved performance on a focussed attention task and increased manual writing speed. Subjective ratings showed OXCZ increased feelings of altertness, clear-headedness and quickwittedness. OXCZ had no effect on the range of long-term memory processes assessed in this study. It is concluded that at the doses employed, OXCZ has a slightly stimulant effect on some aspects of psychomotor functioning.

Randomized double-blind comparison of cognitive and EEG effects of lacosamide and carbamazepine.	DOI: 10.1016/j.yebeh.2016.07.007	Differential effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is more commonly determined by tolerability than efficacy. Cognitive effects of AEDs can adversely affect tolerability and quality of life. This study evaluated cognitive and EEG effects of lacosamide (LCM) compared with carbamazepine immediate-release (CBZ-IR). A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, two-period crossover, fixed-dose study in healthy subjects compared neuropsychological and EEG effects of LCM (150mg, b.i.d.) and CBZ-IR (200mg, t.i.d.). Testing was conducted at screening, predrug baseline, the end of each treatment period (3-week titration; 3-week maintenance), and the end of each washout period (4weeks after treatment). A composite Z-score was derived for the primary outcome variable (computerized cognitive tests and traditional neuropsychological measures) and separately for the EEG measures. Other variables included individual computer, neuropsychological, and EEG scores and adverse events (AEs). Subjects included 60 healthy adults (57% female; mean age: 34.4years [SD: 10.5]); 44 completed both treatments; 41 were per protocol subjects. Carbamazepine immediate-release had worse scores compared with LCM for the primary composite neuropsychological outcome (mean difference=0.33 [SD: 1.36], p=0.011) and for the composite EEG score (mean difference=0.92 [SD: 1.77], p=0.003). Secondary analyses across the individual variables revealed that CBZ-IR was statistically worse than LCM on 36% (4/11) of the neuropsychological tests (computerized and noncomputerized) and 0% of the four EEG measures; none favored CBZ-IR. Drug-related AEs occurred more with CBZ-IR (49%) than LCM (22%). Lacosamide had fewer untoward neuropsychological and EEG effects and fewer AEs and AE-related discontinuations than CBZ-IR in healthy subjects. Lacosamide exhibits a favorable cognitive profile.

Cognition and health-related quality of life in a well-defined subgroup of patients with partial epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1007/s004150200008	To investigate the extent and nature of the objective and subjective cognitive deficits and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adult outpatients with relatively well-controlled partial epilepsy without symptomatic aetiology, who were on carbamazepine (CBZ) monotherapy. Furthermore, we studied the influence of the epilepsy history and medication on various cognitive functions and the HRQOL. 56 outpatients (29 male, 27 female, mean age 41.3 years) with partial epilepsy were compared with 56 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls. Patients were tested on attention, memory, speed of information processing, and executive functioning. Questionnaires aimed at measuring self-perceived cognitive functioning (CFQ) and HRQOL (SF-36) were administered. Mann Whitney-U tests were used to compare the two groups. Linear regression analysis was performed to identify the epilepsy and medication-related factors that are associated with cognitive functioning and HRQOL. Patients scored lower on measures of attention (P = 0.03), learning (P = 0.02) and speed of information processing (P = 0.00). Mental aspects of HRQOL such as fatigue were lower (P = 0.00), whereas physical functioning was unaffected. These patients also expressed reductions in mental functioning as indicated by a low self-perceived cognitive functioning (P = 0.01). Age at onset, duration of epilepsy, seizure type, seizure frequency, localisation, years on CBZ, and CBZ dosage were not related to cognitive functioning or HRQOL. Patients with partial epilepsy, even when able to maintain regular jobs, have impaired cognition and HRQOL that cannot be attributed to their epilepsy history or CBZ dosage or years of CBZ intake. Therefore, physicians should be more aware of their cognition and HRQOL, in addition to the antiepileptic drug regime.

Oxcarbazepine monotherapy in benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes: a clinical and cognitive evaluation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.yebeh.2005.07.012	We report on 70 patients (aged 5.2-11.6 years) newly diagnosed with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) who were assigned to oxcarbazepine (OXC) monotherapy. All of them underwent clinical and electroencephalographic examination at baseline and at 3- to 6-month intervals during the study. Psychometric assessment was performed at baseline and after 18 months of treatment with the WISC-III, Illinois Test of Psychomotor Abilities, DSM-IV, and Bender-Santucci test. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to describe differences in the frequency of abnormal findings: (1) at initial evaluation, comparing patients with a matched group of 45 healthy controls, and (2) after 18 months of OXC monotherapy, as an individual follow-up in the patient group. Cognitive assessment at baseline revealed mild learning disabilities in 9% of patients and 7% of controls; all participants had a normal intelligence quotient. During the follow-up, sustained cessation of seizures under medication was observed in 53% of patients; an additional 21% had some relapse but were subsequently rendered seizure free, 21% experienced a >50% improvement, and 5% showed no improvement. Normalization of interictal epileptiform activity was observed in 58% of patients, 35% showed an improvement in the grade of electroencephalographic pathology, and 7% manifested no change at all. The initial mildly weak scores in isolated cognitive domains did not deteriorate, and even improved in some cases, during the course of the study, with concomitant electroencephalographic improvement or normalization and effective seizure control. The results of this study suggest that OXC is effective in preventing seizures and normalizing electroencephalograms and seems to preserve cognitive functions and behavioral abilities as long-term monotherapy in children with typical BECTS.

Effect of acute doses of controlled-release carbamazepine on clinical, psychomotor, electrophysiological, and cognitive parameters of brain function.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1992.tb02324.x	The neurotoxic effect of acute doses of carbamazepine controlled-release (CBZ-CR) divitabs (800, 1,200, and 1,600 mg) was assessed on clinical, psychomotor, electrophysiological, and cognitive parameters of brain function in 10 healthy volunteers in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase I study. Significant changes compared to placebo were demonstrated for the clinical scales, ataxia (AT), convergence of the near-point (CNP), peak saccadic velocity (PSV), critical flicker fusion (CFF), spectral analysis of the EEG, and brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) tests. Digit repetition, digit symbol substitution, Sternberg memory scanning time, Sternberg choice reaction time, saccadic latency, and saccadic accuracy showed important negative findings. Significant clinical tolerance to side effects developed within 20 to 33 h after CBZ-CR dosage during a period in which the mean CBZ blood levels remained virtually unchanged. CBZ-CR, 800, 1,200, and 1,600 mg yielded low, medium, and high therapeutic blood levels, respectively, for +10 to +33 h after dosage without the development of severe clinical side effects.

Cutaneous antihistaminic action of cetirizine and dose-related EEG concomitants of sedation in man.	DOI: 10.1016/0014-2999(95)00756-3	The cutaneous antihistaminic action (prick test; 1:100, 1:200 and 1:1000) and neuropsychological and electroencephalographic (EEG) concomitants of sedation following the histamine H1 receptor antagonist cetirizine (10- and 20-mg acute oral doses) and chlorpheniramine, 4 mg, were investigated in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study in healthy male volunteers (age 23-29 years). With an average Cmax of cetirizine of 697.0 ng/ml (10 mg) and 1000.2 ng/ml (20 mg), the diameter of histamine-induced skin weals was reduced by 24.0-74.9% depending on histamine concentration and with no dose dependence for cetirizine. Placebo and chlorpheniramine were ineffective. Behavioral or neuropsychological signs of sedation were never observed. An increase of the 6.5-14.5 Hz EEG power, with anterior scalp preponderance, was observed after chlorpheniramine or cetirizine 20 mg. This effect of cetirizine was accounted for by a substantial increase of power in the 6.5-8.0 Hz frequency subsegment and is regarded, for these experimental conditions, as an established early EEG indication of mild sedation (vigilance 'state A'). No EEG effects were observed after placebo or cetirizine at the 10 mg dose. The existence of some histaminergic (H1) specificity of the mechanisms modulating vigilance and of a threshold dose of cetirizine for sedative action is suggested.

Association between the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potential, serotonergic neurotransmission and treatment outcome in patients with depression.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2023.02.008	Previous studies have suggested that the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) is associated with the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment in patients with major depressive disorders (MDD). Furthermore, both LDAEP and the cerebral serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) density is inversely related to brain serotonin levels. We included 84 patients with MDD and 22 healthy controls to examined the association between LDAEP and treatment response and its association with cerebral 5-HT4R density. Participants underwent both EEG and 5-HT4R neuroimaging with [11C]SB207145 PET. Thirty-nine patients with MDD were re-examined after 8 weeks of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors/serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI). We found that the cortical source of LDAEP was higher in untreated patients with MDD compared to healthy controls (p=0.03). Prior to SSRI/SNRI treatment, subsequent treatment responders had a negative association between LDAEP and depressive symptoms and a positive association between scalp LDAEP and symptom improvement at week 8. This was not found in source LDAEP. In healthy controls, we found a positive correlation between both scalp and source LDAEP and cerebral 5-HT4R binding but that was not observed in patients with MDD. We did not see any changes in scalp and source LDAEP in response to SSRI/SNRI treatment. These results support a theoretical framework where both LDAEP and cerebral 5-HT4R are indices of cerebral 5-HT levels in healthy individuals while this association seems to be disrupted in MDD. The combination of the two biomarkers may be useful for stratifying patients with MDD.

Pharmacokinetics and electroencephalographic effects of darodipine 50-200 mg modified release (MR) acute oral administration: dose-finding study in healthy volunteers.		Pharmacokinetics and electroencephalographic [EEG; power spectral analysis] effects of the acute oral Ca-antagonist darodipine (50 mg MR, 100 mg MR, and 200 mg MR) were investigated in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study on healthy male volunteers (age 23-28 yrs). No effects on heart rate, blood pressure or behaviour were observed with these doses at average Cmax levels ranging between 4.74 and 33.53 ng/ml and with a Tmax ranging from 2 to 6 h depending on the dose. No significant differences in drug kinetics were observed between the 100-mg and the 200-mg dose. A significant increase of EEG total power and a decrease of relative power in the 14.5-32.0 Hz frequency interval were observed at the 100-mg and 200-mg doses. These effects were greater and more consistent across subjects at 100 mg than at 200 mg, and were correlated with darodipine plasma concentrations, with indications of an active concentration threshold at approximately 4-5 ng/ml. The 50-mg dose proved ineffective on the EEG signal.

Central effects of the calcium antagonist, nifedipine.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1991.tb03949.x	1. Central effects of the calcium antagonist, nifedipine retard (10, 20 and 40 mg) and nifedipine capsules (10 mg) were studied in 14 healthy male subjects. Two placebos and an active control drug, oxazepam (15 mg), were included. Medication was administered double-blind at 10.00 h. The effects of drugs on performance and subjective feelings were assessed before and from 1.5-2.5 h and 3.5-4.5 h after ingestion, and recordings of the electrical activity of the brain (EEG) and body sway carried out. 2. Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, together with critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. The EEG was recorded with eyes open while the subjects carried out a mental arithmetic task, and with eyes closed, when they were required to relax. Body sway was recorded with eyes open and with eyes closed. Subjects assessed their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analogue scales. 3. Nifedipine did not alter performance levels on any of the skills tested, while oxazepam (15 mg) increased the number of errors (P less than 0.01) and reduced accuracy at continuous attention (P less than 0.01). 4. Nifedipine (10 mg) reduced total power of the EEG in the frequency range (0.5-30 Hz), and nifedipine (20 mg) increased total alpha power (7.5-13 Hz) (P less than 0.05). Oxazepam reduced alpha and increased beta 1 power (13.5-21 Hz).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Attentiondrug effects', 'Blood Pressuredrug effects', 'Braindrug effects', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'Heart Ratedrug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memorydrug effects', 'Nifedipinebloodpharmacology', 'Oxazepampharmacology', 'Reaction Timedrug effects']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1954069/	['Nifedipine', 'Dihydropyridines', 'Benzodiazepine', 'Calcium', 'PYRIDINE']	[4485, 407038, 134664, 5460341, 1049]	1954069	['1991', 'Nov']
Tyrosine ameliorates heat induced delay in event related potential P300 and contingent negative variation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bandc.2013.09.005	The efficacy of tyrosine, a catecholamine precursor, as a countermeasure in the reduction of cognitive decline during heat exposure (HE) using event-related potential P300, and contingent negative variation (CNV) was evaluated. Ten healthy males, age 20-30years participated in the study. Volunteers received placebo or tyrosine (6.5g) 90min prior to HE (1.5h in 45°C+30% RH). P300 latency was significantly increased (p<0.01) during exposure with placebo, which was reduced significantly (p<0.01) after tyrosine supplementation. There was an increase in CNV M100 latency (p<0.05) and reaction time (p<0.01) and decrease in M100 amplitude (p<0.01) during HE with placebo, which returns to near normal level with the tyrosine administration. A significantly higher plasma norepinephrine (p<0.05), dopamine and epinephrine levels were detected in tyrosine supplemented group post heat exposure. HE increases the brain catecholamine activity thereby reduces the plasma norepinephrine and dopamine level leading to a reduction in cognitive performances. Tyrosine supplementation increases the catecholamine level and reduces the impairment of cognitive performance during HE.

Plasma catecholamines and selective slow wave sleep deprivation.	DOI: 10.1159/000048681	The present study evaluated the effect of slow wave sleep (SWS) deprivation on plasma levels of catecholamines in healthy male volunteers. Eleven volunteers spent 4 nights in the sleep laboratory (2 nights of habituation and 2 further nights); during the latter, 1 night served as control, and in the other, SWS deprivation was performed. Blood was drawn at 30-min intervals. SWS was reduced by 86%; no sleep stage 4 was observed during the SWS-deprived nights. SWS reduction was found not to correlate with catecholamine levels. However, epinephrine levels were found to be sensitive to sleep fragmentation. The time interval between arousals in the SWS-deprived night as well as the difference in sleep efficiency were related to increases in epinephrine levels (p < 0.01 and p < 0.025, respectively). These results support the view that continuity rather than the duration of SWS is important for the recuperative value of sleep.

Effects of sleep and sleep deprivation on catecholamine and interleukin-2 levels in humans: clinical implications.	DOI: 10.1210/jcem.84.6.5788	The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of nocturnal sleep, partial night sleep deprivation, and sleep stages on catecholamine and interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels in humans. Circulating levels of catecholamines and IL-2 were sampled every 30 min during 2 nights: undisturbed, baseline sleep and partial sleep deprivation-late night (PSD-L; awake from 0300-0600 h) in 17 healthy male volunteers. Sleep was monitored somnopolygraphically. Sleep onset was associated with a significant (P < 0.05) decline of circulating concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine, with a nocturnal nadir that occurred 1 h after nocturnal sleep. On the PSD-L night, levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine significantly (P < 0.05) increased in association with nocturnal awakening. During stage 3-4 sleep, levels of norepinephrine, but not epinephrine, were significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared to average levels during the awake period, stages 1-2 sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep. Nocturnal levels of circulating IL-2 did not change with sleep onset or in relation to PSD-L or the various sleep stages. We conclude that sleep onset is associated with changes in levels of circulating catecholamines. Loss of sleep and disordered sleep with decreases in slow wave sleep may serve to elevate nocturnal catecholamine levels and contribute to cardiovascular disease.

Restitution of neurophysiological functions, performance, and subjective symptoms after moderate insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in non-diabetic men.	DOI: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9136(199603)13:3<218::AID-DIA25>3.0.CO;2-D	The restoration of cognitive function was studied in 10 healthy men aged 26 years (25.5 +/- 1.2 years; mean +/- SD) after insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (arterialized blood glucose 2.5 +/- 0.4 mmol l-1) for 62 +/- 8 min. Another group of six men participated in a single blind sham study for comparison. The hypoglycaemic event caused a significant increase (p = 0.006) in serum adrenaline levels. Ratings of adrenergically mediated symptoms increased during hypoglycaemia (p = 0.006), as did neuroglycopenic symptoms (p = 0.002), although neuroglycopenia ratings increased in both studies. During hypoglycaemia, P300 amplitudes in a relatively demanding visual search task decreased (p = 0.02), whereas easier tasks were unaffected. The amplitudes were restored after 40 min of normoglycaemia. Reaction time deteriorated after restoration of normoglycaemia, suggesting an effect of hypoglycaemia on learning. Thus, hypoglycaemia at a blood glucose level that is common among patients treated with insulin causes clear cognitive dysfunction, although restoration of the cognitive dysfunction to normal was fast.

Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CHF 3381, a novel N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, after single oral doses in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1177/0091270003256137	A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of CHF 3381 in 56 young healthy male volunteers. The central nervous system effects of CHF 3381 were also evaluated, as well as the effect of food on the rate and extent of CHF 3381 absorption. Seven doses of CHF 3381 (25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 450, and 600 mg) were evaluated in an escalating order. At each dose level, 6 subjects were given CHF 3381, and 2 subjects were given placebo. Safety and tolerability evaluation included adverse events, physical examination, vital functions, electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, and 24-hour Holter (100-mg and 450-mg dose panels). Plasma and urinary concentrations of CHF 3381 and its two main metabolites (CHF 3567 and 2-aminoindane) were measured with a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. Central nervous system effects were evaluated with the simple reaction time (SRT); learning memory task (LMT); Bond & Lader Visual Analog Scale for alertness, contentedness, and calmness; Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI); and electroencephalogram. There were no serious adverse events; the most frequent adverse events were dizziness, abnormal thinking, and asthenia. The number of adverse events with moderate intensity increased sharply with the dose, with no or few events up to 450 mg and 17 events with 600 mg. Therefore, 600 mg was defined as the maximum tolerated dose. There were no significant treatment effects on cardiovascular function and electrocardiogram parameters at any CHF 3381 dose or on oral temperature or laboratory tests. There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory variables. CHF 3381 was absorbed rapidly (tmax = 0.5-2 h) and cleared from plasma with a half-life of 3 to 4 hours. Plasma levels of CHF 3381 and its two major metabolites were found to be proportional to the dose. 2-Aminoindane formed slowly and reached much lower concentrations compared to the parent compound and the other metabolite (CHF 3567). Within 48 hours after dosing, 2% to 6% of the administered dose was found in the urine as unchanged drug, about 50% to 55% as the acid derivative (CHF 3567), and 2% to 3% as 2-aminoindane. Ingestion of food did not affect the extent of absorption of the drug, while the rate of absorption was considerably reduced (tmax = 4 h). No significant effects of CHF 3381 were observed on attention (SRT) or memory (LMT). Visual analog scales revealed a decreasing effect of CHF 3381 on alertness at 1 hour that reached statistical significance at 300 and 600 mg. EEG spectral analysis revealed minor decreasing effects of the 200-mg dose on total electric power measured at 2 hours. A stimulant effect was detected by the ARCI scale 24 hours after the 300-mg dose and might be related to the slow formation of the 2-aminoindane metabolite. In conclusion, this study has shown that the maximum tolerated dose of CHF 3381 after single oral administration in young healthy male volunteers is 600 mg. CHF 3381 displays linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 25 to 600 mg. The compound is rapidly absorbed and cleared from plasma with a half-life of 3 to 4 hours. The ingestion of food seems to not affect the extent of absorption of the drug. Minor effects on the central nervous system were detected at doses equal to or greater than 300 mg.

BMS-181168 for protection of the human brain against hypoxia: double-blind, placebo-controlled EEG mapping studies.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2007-1014303	In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, the antihypoxidotic properties of BMS-181168 (previously BMY 21502)--a 1-[[1-[2-(trifluoromethyl)-4-pyrimidinyl]-4-piperidinyl]methyl]-2- pyrrolidinone alleviating impairment of learning and memory in the animal--were studied utilizing EEG mapping under an experimental hypoxic hypoxidosis. The latter was induced by a fixed gas combination of 9.8% oxygen (O2) and 90.2% nitrogen (N2) (found at 6000 m altitude), which was inhaled for 23 minutes under normobaric conditions by 16 healthy male volunteers (aged 23-35 years, mean 27.2 years). After an adaptation session, they received in randomized order at weekly intervals oral single doses of placebo, or of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg BMS-181168. Evaluation of blood gases (PO2, PCO2, SO2), adverse events, and EEG mapping was carried out prior to drug administration and 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours post-drug, on each occasion under normoxic and transient hypoxic conditions. Hypoxemia was controlled by drawing arterialized capillary blood samples from the earlobes after hyperemization of the latter (after 0, 14, and 23 minutes of hypoxic gas inhalation) and by oximetry. After 23 minutes of inhalation, analysis showed a drop in PO2 from 98 to 48 mm Hg, in PCO2 from 41 to 31 mm Hg, and in SO2 from 97 to 80%. Descriptive statistical analyses of EEG mapping data demonstrated under hypoxia/placebo conditions an increase in delta/theta activity and a decrease in alpha activity as well as a slowing of the delta/theta centroid and an increase in the alpha and beta centroid, which suggests a marked deterioration in physiological vigilance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Arousaldrug effects', 'Blood Gas Analysis', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia, Brainphysiopathologyprevention & control', 'Male', 'Psychotropic Drugspharmacology', 'Pyrimidinespharmacology', 'Pyrrolidinonespharmacology']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7838889/	['BMS-181168']	[129930]	7838889	['1994', 'Sep']
Acute Effects of a Polyphenol-Rich Leaf Extract of Mangifera indica L. (Zynamite) on Cognitive Function in Healthy Adults: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Crossover Study.	DOI: 10.3390/nu12082194	Extracts made from the leaves of the mango food plant (Mangifera indica L., Anacardiaceae) have a long history of medicinal usage, most likely due to particularly high levels of the polyphenol mangiferin. In rodent models, oral mangiferin protects cognitive function and brain tissue from a number of challenges and modulates cerebro-electrical activity. Recent evidence has confirmed the latter effect in healthy humans following a mangiferin-rich mango leaf extract using quantitative electroencephalography (EEG). The current study therefore investigated the effects of a single dose of mango leaf extract, standardised to contain >60% mangiferin (Zynamite®), on cognitive function and mood. This study adopted a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design in which 70 healthy young adults (18 to 45 years) received 300 mg mango leaf extract and a matched placebo, on separate occasions, separated by at least 7 days. On each occasion, cognitive/mood assessments were undertaken pre-dose and at 30 min, 3 h and 5 h post-dose using the Computerised Mental Performance Assessment System (COMPASS) assessment battery and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). The results showed that a single dose of 300 mg mango leaf extract significantly improved performance accuracy across the tasks in the battery, with domain-specific effects seen in terms of enhanced performance on an 'Accuracy of Attention' factor and an 'Episodic Memory' factor. Performance was also improved across all three tasks (Rapid Visual Information Processing, Serial 3s and Serial 7s subtraction tasks) that make up the Cognitive Demand Battery sub-section of the assessment. All of these cognitive benefits were seen across the post-dose assessments (30 min, 3 h, 5 h). There were no interpretable treatment related effects on mood. These results provide the first demonstration of cognition enhancement following consumption of mango leaf extract and add to previous research showing that polyphenols and polyphenol rich extracts can improve brain function.

A novel time-delayed correlation method decomposes mismatch response without using subtraction.	DOI: 10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629706	"The mismatch response (MMR) is thought to be a neurophysiological measure of novel auditory detection that could serve as a translational biomarker of various neurological diseases. When recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), the MMR is traditionally extracted by subtracting the event-related potential/field (ERP/ERF) elicited in response to ""deviant"" sounds that occur randomly within a train of repetitive ""standard"" sounds. To overcome the limitations of this subtraction procedure, we propose a novel method which we call weighted-BSST/k, which uses only the deviant response to derive the MMR. We hypothesized that this novel weighted-BSST/k method highlights responses related to the detection of the deviant stimulus and is more sensitive than independent component analysis (ICA). To test this hypothesis and the validity and efficacy of the weighted-BSST/k in comparison with ICA (infomax), we evaluated the methods in 12 healthy adults. Auditory stimuli were presented at a constant rate of 2 Hz. Frequency MMRs at a sensor level were obtained from the bilateral temporal lobes with the subtraction approach at 96-276 ms (the MMR time range), defined on the basis of spatio-temporal cluster permutation analysis. In the application of the weighted-BSST/k, the deviant responses were given a constant weight on the MMR time range. The ERF elicited by the weighted deviant responses demonstrated one or a few dominant components representing the MMR with a high signal-to-noise ratio and similar topography to that of the sensor space analysis using the subtraction approach. In contrast, infomax or weighted-infomax revealed many minor or pseudo components as constituents of the MMR. Our new approach may assist in using the MMR in basic and clinical research.Clinical Relevance-Our proposed method opens a new and potentially useful way to analyze event-related MEG/EEG data."

Frontal electroencephalogram based drug, sex, and age independent sedation level prediction using non-linear machine learning algorithms.	DOI: 10.1007/s10877-020-00627-3	Brain monitors which track quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures to monitor sedation levels are drug and patient specific. There is a need for robust sedation level monitoring systems to accurately track sedation levels across all drug classes, sex and age groups. Forty-four quantitative features estimated from a pooled dataset of 204 EEG recordings from 66 healthy adult volunteers who received either propofol, dexmedetomidine, or sevoflurane (all with and without remifentanil) were used in a machine learning based automated system to estimate the depth of sedation. Model training and evaluation were performed using leave-one-out cross validation methodology. We trained four machine learning models to predict sedation levels and evaluated the influence of remifentanil, age, and sex on the prediction performance. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the prediction model. The ensemble tree with bagging outperformed other machine learning models and predicted sedation levels with an AUC = 0.88 (0.81-0.90). There were significant differences in the prediction probability of the automated systems when trained and tested across different age groups and sex. The performance of the EEG based sedation level prediction system is drug, sex, and age specific. Nonlinear machine-learning models using quantitative EEG features can accurately predict sedation levels. The results obtained in this study may provide a useful reference for developing next generation EEG based sedation level prediction systems using advanced machine learning algorithms.

Predictive processing of pitch trends in newborn infants.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2015.02.048	The notion of predictive sound processing suggests that the auditory system prepares for upcoming sounds once it has detected regular features within a sequence. Here we investigated whether predictive processes are operating at birth in the human auditory system. Event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded from healthy newborns to occasional ascending pitch steps occurring in the 2nd or the 5th position within trains of tones with otherwise monotonously descending pitch. If the trains were processed in a predictive manner only deviant pitch steps occurring in the later train position would elicit the discriminative mismatch response (MMR). Deviants delivered in the 5th but not in the 2nd position of the tone trains elicited a significant MMR response. These results suggest that newborns represent pitch trends within sound sequences and they process them in a predictive manner.

Sleep in bereavement-related depression during and after pharmacotherapy with nortriptyline.	DOI: 10.1177/089198879400700201	Our objective was to assess the effects of nortriptyline on electroencephalographic sleep and subjective sleep quality in spousally bereaved, depressed elders. Ten elderly volunteers with bereavement-related major depression had electroencephalographic sleep studies while depressed, after remission of depressive symptoms while still taking nortriptyline, and after nortriptyline discontinuation. Changes in sleep measures over time were compared both within bereaved subjects and with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Remission of depressive symptoms while still on nortriptyline was associated with improvements in sleep quality (P < .002), rapid eye movement (REM) percent (P < .02), REM latency (P < .05), REM density (P < .05), and delta sleep ratio (P < .05). After discontinuation of nortriptyline, REM percent, REM latency, and delta ratio reverted to pretreatment levels, while sleep efficiency and sleep quality continued to show improvement coincident with sustained clinical remission. These data suggest that nortriptyline may be clinically useful in treating the sleep disturbance of elders with bereavement-related depression and that a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial is warranted.

Sleep in late-life recurrent depression. Changes during early continuation therapy with nortriptyline.		The sleep of thirty elderly patients with recurrent unipolar depression was examined at baseline (before acute treatment of the index episode) and again in a state of symptomatic remission with nortriptyline (mean steady-state level: 82.1 ng/ml). Continuation therapy with nortriptyline was associated with improvement of polysomnographic sleep maintenance (mainly in the third and fourth sleep cycles, to a level similar to that of controls), prolongation of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep latency (exceeding that of controls), and potentiation of slow-wave activity during the first non-REM (NREM) sleep period. Clinical improvement, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, was significantly associated with shift of delta activity toward sleep onset (p less than 0.002), prolongation of REM sleep latency (p less than 0.0001), and improvement in sleep maintenance (p less than 0.0002). Multiple regression analysis showed that the single best correlate of clinical change was prolongation of REM sleep latency (i.e., prolongation of first NREM period). Perceived sleep quality improved significantly during early continuation therapy with nortriptyline, but not to the level reported by a group of 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The findings are consistent with the concept that anti-depressant drug efficacy may depend upon strengthening of the homeostatic regulation of sleep and upon changes in the REM-sleep regulation.

Quantitative electroencephalographic measures in homicidal men with antisocial personality disorder.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psychres.2005.05.005	Many symptoms of antisocial personality disorder have been proposed to be related to decreased daytime vigilance. To explore this hypothesis, quantitative analyses were conducted of the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of drug-free and detoxified homicidal male offenders with antisocial personality disorder as the primary diagnosis. Subjects comprised 16 men recruited from a forensic psychiatric examination in a special ward of a university psychiatric hospital. Fifteen healthy age- and gender-matched controls with no criminal record or history of physical violence consisted of hospital staff and students. An overall reduction of alpha power was observed in the waking EEG of offenders. A bilateral increase in occipital delta and theta power was also found in these individuals. This study provides further support to the growing evidence of brain dysfunction in severe aggressive behavior. Homicidal offenders with antisocial personality disorder seem to have difficulties in maintaining normal daytime arousal. Decreased vigilance, together with social and psychological variables, may explain their aberrant behavior in everyday life. New studies are, however, needed to specify the vigilance problems of this patient group.

Growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor-1 axis, leptin and sleep in anorexia nervosa patients.	DOI: 10.1159/000070013	The present study characterizes the relationships between severe malnutrition, sleep, growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH-IGF-1) axis, and leptin levels in anorexia nervosa (AN) patients before and after weight gain. Eleven restricting-type anorectic females (mean age = 19.7 years) with severe starvation state [mean body mass index (BMI) = 13.3] were studied using polysomnography and spectral power analysis. The hormone levels were measured in the morning after sleep recording. Eleven normal-weight, age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers without a history of any eating disorder served as controls. After nutritional treatment for about 2 months (65.7 +/- 6.4 days), sleep examinations and blood tests were repeated. At this stage, the study group consisted of 5 patients (mean BMI = 15.6). Higher IGF-1 and leptin levels were associated with longer and deeper sleep among anorectics. The sleep parameters including the percentages of stage 1 sleep and SWS as well as IGF-1 tended to normalize after only limited weight gain. Sleep disturbances in anorectics may be mediated through changes in the levels of the GH-IGF-1 axis hormones, as well as the levels of leptin.

Frontal P300 decrements, childhood conduct disorder, family history, and the prediction of relapse among abstinent cocaine abusers.	DOI: 10.1016/s0376-8716(96)01311-7	P300 event related brain potentials were studied in 49 cocaine dependent patients, abstinent for 1-5 months, and 20 healthy, non-drug-dependent controls. Patients were assigned to one of two subgroups based on the presence/absence of a DSM-IIIR diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Analyses of P300s recorded during a visual selective attention task revealed reduced amplitudes at frontal electrode sites among patients with ASPD, relative to the ASPD negative patient and control groups. The frontal P300 decrement was significantly correlated with the number of childhood conduct disorder symptoms, but not with the presence/absence of a family history of alcoholism. A secondary analysis examined the relationship between P300 amplitude among cocaine dependent patients and their future behavior, i.e., relapse versus continued abstinence. Discriminant function analysis revealed that P300 amplitude alone accurately identified 70.6% of the patients who later relapsed, and 53.3% of the patients who did not.

Pattern shift visual evoked potentials in abstinent cocaine-dependent, alcohol-dependent, and cross-dependent patients.	DOI: 10.1016/0376-8716(95)01210-9	The present study evaluated pattern shift visual evoked potential (VEP) amplitudes and latencies in four groups of adult subjects, characterized by the presence/absence of a recent history of alcohol dependence factorially crossed with the presence/absence of a recent history of cocaine dependence. All of the subjects were healthy and uncomplicated by histories of serious head injury, seizures (including drug-related seizures), and major medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorders. The subjects comprising the three patient groups were evaluated after 1 - 5 months of verified abstinence. Analyses of VEPs evoked by checkerboard reversal indicated a main effect of previous cocaine dependence on P100 latency. No main effect of previous alcohol dependence and no alcohol by cocaine dependence interaction were detected. The increased P100 latencies detected in abstinent, cocaine-dependent subjects are most likely related to cerebrovascular and neurological effects of chronic cocaine use.

Our data suggest that cocaine-dependent subjects generate smaller P50 components when long ISIs are used with multiple repetitions (in the trains paradigm).

Gene x abstinence effects on drug cue reactivity in addiction: multimodal evidence.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0695-13.2013	Functional polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1 or SLC6A3) modulate responsiveness to salient stimuli, such that carriers of one 9R-allele of DAT1 (compared with homozygote carriers of the 10R-allele) show heightened reactivity to drug-related reinforcement in addiction. Here, using multimodal neuroimaging and behavioral dependent variables in 73 human cocaine-addicted individuals and 47 healthy controls, we hypothesized and found that cocaine-addicted carriers of a 9R-allele exhibited higher responses to drug cues, but only among individuals who had used cocaine within 72 h of the study as verified by positive cocaine urine screens (a state characterized by intense craving). Importantly, this responsiveness to drug cues was reliably preserved across multimodal imaging and behavioral probes: psychophysiological event-related potentials, self-report, simulated cocaine choice, and fMRI. Because drug cues contribute to relapse, our results identify the DAT1R 9R-allele as a vulnerability allele for relapse especially during early abstinence (e.g., detoxification).

Multimodal evidence of regional midcingulate gray matter volume underlying conflict monitoring.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nicl.2014.05.011	Functional neuroimaging studies have long implicated the mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) in conflict monitoring, but it is not clear whether its structural integrity (i.e., the gray matter volume) influences its conflict monitoring function. In this multimodal study, we used T1-weighted MRI scans as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) to test whether the MCC gray matter volume is associated with the electrocortical marker (i.e., No-go N200 ERP component) of conflict monitoring in healthy individuals. The specificity of such a relationship in health was determined in two ways: by (A) acquiring the same data from individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD), known to have deficits in executive function including behavioral monitoring; and (B) acquiring the P300 ERP component that is linked with attention allocation and not specifically with conflict monitoring. Twenty-five (39.1 ± 8.4 years; 8 females) healthy individuals and 25 (42.7 ± 5.9 years; 6 females) individuals with CUD underwent a rewarded Go/No-go task during which the ERP data was collected, and they also underwent a structural MRI scan. The whole brain regression analysis showed a significant correlation between MCC structural integrity and the well-known ERP measure of conflict monitoring (N200, but not the P300) in healthy individuals, which was absent in CUD who were characterized by reduced MCC gray matter volume, N200 abnormalities as well as reduced task accuracy. In individuals with CUD instead, the N200 amplitude was associated with drug addiction symptomatology. These results show that the integrity of MCC volume is directly associated with the electrocortical correlates of conflict monitoring in healthy individuals, and such an association breaks down in psychopathologies that impact these brain processes. Taken together, this MCC-N200 association may serve as a biomarker of improved behavioral monitoring processes in diseased populations.

The association between psychosis proneness and sensory gating in cocaine-dependent patients and healthy controls.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psychres.2013.08.049	This was a naturalistic study of 23 abstinent cocaine-dependent patients and 38 controls who were studied using a paired-stimulus paradigm to elicit three mid-latency auditory evoked responses (MLAERs), namely, the P50, N100, and P200. Sensory gating was defined as the ratio of the S2 amplitude to the S1 amplitude. Psychosis-proneness was assessed using four Chapman psychosis proneness scales measuring perceptual aberration, magical ideation, social anhedonia, and physical anhedonia. Omnibus correlations based upon the entire sample revealed significant and differential relationships between the MLAER components and psychosis-proneness. Social Anhedonia scale scores accounted for the largest proportion of variance in the P50 gating ratio, while Perceptual Aberration scores accounted for the largest proportion of variance in P200 gating. Psychosis proneness and sensory gating appear to be associated. In particular, poorer P50 gating is related to higher scores on the Social Anhedonia scale in healthy controls and across mixed samples of cocainede-pendent patients and controls. These findings hold significance for the further understanding of the relationship between deficient sensory gating ability and the propensity to developing psychotic symptoms in a vulnerable population like cocaine-dependent individuals.

Cortical excitability in cocaine-dependent patients: a replication and extension of TMS findings.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2004.07.002	Cortical excitability can be assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Previously we observed that TMS motor threshold (MT) was elevated in abstinent cocaine-dependent subjects. In the current study we aimed at replicating our initial finding, exploring other TMS-based measures of excitability, and examining association with personality characteristics. Nineteen cocaine-dependent and 12 healthy control subjects were examined. Resting and activated motor thresholds (RMT and AMT) and duration of the cortical silent period (CSP) were examined. The Cocaine Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) was administered to assess cocaine-induced psychotic symptoms. The relationship between Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scales and cortical excitability measures was also examined. AMT was significantly elevated in cocaine-dependent subjects on both hemispheres. RMT was also significantly elevated on the right hemisphere. No CSP changes were noted. Patients with cocaine-induced paranoia had longer CSPs on the right hemisphere compared to subjects reporting no paranoid experiences. The patients displayed significantly elevated scores on several MMPI scales, though the scale scores did not correlate with cortical excitability measures. These data support our initial finding of decreased cortical excitability in abstinent cocaine-dependent subjects. We interpret this finding as a compensatory mechanism against the stimulating and epileptogenic effects of cocaine.

P300 event-related potential amplitude and impulsivity in cocaine-dependent subjects.	DOI: 10.1159/000079110	Previous studies report reduced amplitude of the P300 event-related potential in cocaine-dependent individuals. Cocaine dependence is also associated with increased impulsivity, possibly due to deficits in cognitive function that are associated with reduced P300 amplitude. In the current study, the relationship between cocaine dependence, impulsivity, and P300 amplitude were examined. An auditory oddball event-related potential task along with self-report (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale version 11) and behavioral laboratory (Immediate and Delayed Memory Task) measures of impulsivity were assessed in healthy controls (n = 14) and subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for current cocaine dependence (n = 17). P300 amplitude was reduced and self-reported and behavioral laboratory impulsivity scores were elevated among the cocaine-dependent group compared to controls. There was a positive correlation between the questionnaire and behavioral laboratory measures of impulsivity, and a negative correlation between impulsivity measures and P300 amplitude. The correlation between self-reported impulsivity scores and P300 amplitude remained after taking into account the number of childhood conduct disorder symptoms. This study supports the hypothesis that the basic neurophysiology responsible for the P300 amplitude in cocaine-dependent individuals is associated with impulsivity independent of a history of childhood conduct disorder symptoms.

Increased electroencephalographic activity in crack-cocaine users visualizing crack cues.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2016.08.016	This study aimed to examine electrophysiologically the cerebral function under visual cue-reactivity paradigm in crack-cocaine users. This was an exploratory open trial in which young crack-cocaine-users and non-users were clinically examined. The participants' brain activity was analyzed by an event-related potentials procedure under a cue-reactivity paradigm with the random visual presentation of crack-related and neutral images. Nine young male crack-cocaine users and nine age-matched male healthy subjects from research center's neighborhood volunteered themselves to participate in this study. We demonstrated through electrophysiological tools that crack-cocaine users are more likely to show higher brain activity, notably in the frontal lobe region, when processing crack-related images. Though imaging studies have already showed increased brain activity in this paradigm, this data shows that event-related potentials can be an effective tool for brain evaluation in addiction.

Structural integrity of the prefrontal cortex modulates electrocortical sensitivity to reward.	DOI: 10.1162/jocn_a_00166	The P300 is a known ERP component assessing stimulus value, including the value of a monetary reward. In parallel, the incentive value of reinforcers relies on the PFC, a major cortical projection region of the mesocortical reward pathway. Here we show a significant positive correlation between P300 response to money (vs. no money) with PFC gray matter volume in the OFC, ACC, and dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC in healthy control participants. In contrast, individuals with cocaine use disorders showed compromises in both P300 sensitivity to money and PFC gray matter volume in the ventrolateral PFC and OFC and their interdependence. These results document for the first time the importance of gray matter structural integrity of subregions of PFC to the reward-modulated P300 response.

Sensitivity to monetary reward is most severely compromised in recently abstaining cocaine addicted individuals: a cross-sectional ERP study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2012.01.001	Recent studies suggest that drug-addicted individuals have a dampened cortical response to non-drug rewards. However, it remains unclear whether recency of drug use impacts this impairment. Therefore, in this event-related potential study, recency of cocaine use was objectively determined by measuring cocaine in urine on study day. Thirty-five individuals with current cocaine use disorder [CUD: 21 testing positive (CUD+) and 14 testing negative (CUD-) for cocaine in urine] and 23 healthy controls completed a sustained attention task with graded monetary incentives (0¢, 1¢ and 45¢). Unlike in controls, in both CUD subgroups P300 amplitude was not modulated by the varying amounts of money and the CUD- showed the most severe impairment as documented by the lowest P300 amplitudes and task accuracy. Moreover, while recency of drug use was associated with better accuracy and higher P300 amplitudes, chronic drug use was associated with lower sensitivity to money. These results extend our previous findings of decreased sustained sensitivity to monetary reward in CUD+ to recently abstaining individuals, where level of impairment was most severe. Taken together, these results support the self-medication hypothesis, where CUD may be self-administering cocaine to avoid or compensate for underlying cognitive and emotional difficulties albeit with a long-term detrimental effect on sensitivity to non-drug reward.

Motivated attention to cocaine and emotional cues in abstinent and current cocaine users--an ERP study.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2011.07663.x	Event-related potentials (ERPs) are a direct measure of neural activity and are ideally suited to study the time-course of attentional engagement with emotional and drug-related stimuli in addiction. In particular, the late positive potential (LPP) appears to be enhanced following cocaine-related compared with neutral stimuli in human participants with cocaine use disorders (CUD). However, previous studies have not directly compared cocaine-related with emotional stimuli while examining potential differences between abstinent and current cocaine users. The present study examined ERPs in 55 CUD (27 abstinent and 28 current users) and 29 matched healthy controls while they passively viewed pleasant, unpleasant, neutral and cocaine-related pictures. To examine the time-course of attention to these stimuli, we analysed both an early and later window in the LPP as well as the early posterior negativity (EPN), established in assessing motivated attention. Cocaine pictures elicited increased electrocortical measures of motivated attention in ways similar to affectively pleasant and unpleasant pictures in all CUD, an effect that was no longer discernible during the late LPP window for the current users. This group also exhibited deficient processing of the other emotional stimuli (early LPP window - pleasant pictures; late LPP window - pleasant and unpleasant pictures). Results were unique to the LPP and not EPN. Taken together, results support a relatively early attention bias to cocaine stimuli in cocaine-addicted individuals, further suggesting that recent cocaine use decreases such attention bias during later stages of processing but at the expense of deficient processing of other emotional stimuli.

Impaired neural response to negative prediction errors in cocaine addiction.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2777-14.2015	Learning can be guided by unexpected success or failure, signaled via dopaminergic positive reward prediction error (+RPE) and negative reward-prediction error (-RPE) signals, respectively. Despite conflicting empirical evidence, RPE signaling is thought to be impaired in drug addiction. To resolve this outstanding question, we studied as a measure of RPE the feedback negativity (FN) that is sensitive to both reward and the violation of expectation. We examined FN in 25 healthy controls; 25 individuals with cocaine-use disorder (CUD) who tested positive for cocaine on the study day (CUD+), indicating cocaine use within the past 72 h; and in 25 individuals with CUD who tested negative for cocaine (CUD-). EEG was acquired while the participants performed a gambling task predicting whether they would win or lose money on each trial given three known win probabilities (25, 50, or 75%). FN was scored for the period in each trial when the actual outcome (win or loss) was revealed. A significant interaction between prediction, outcome, and group revealed that controls showed increased FN to unpredicted compared with predicted wins (i.e., intact +RPE) and decreased FN to unpredicted compared with predicted losses (i.e., intact -RPE). However, neither CUD subgroup showed FN modulation to loss (i.e., impaired -RPE), and unlike CUD+ individuals, CUD- individuals also did not show FN modulation to win (i.e., impaired +RPE). Thus, using FN, the current study directly documents -RPE deficits in CUD individuals. The mechanisms underlying -RPE signaling impairments in addiction may contribute to the disadvantageous nature of excessive drug use, which can persist despite repeated unfavorable life experiences (e.g., frequent incarcerations).

Cocaine craving is associated with electrophysiological brain responses to cocaine-related stimuli.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2008.00100.x	Several studies show that substance dependence disorders are characterized by an enhanced processing of substance-related stimuli. The present study was designed to examine the association between craving levels and selective processing of drug cues in cocaine-dependent patients using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). In abstinent cocaine-dependent patients and a healthy control group, we studied the late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes elicited by neutral and cocaine-related stimuli. The results show that cocaine-dependent patients have an enhanced electrophysiological response in the late LPP time window to cocaine-related stimuli as compared to controls, suggesting an enhanced processing of these stimuli. Most importantly, a robust association was observed between cocaine craving and LPP amplitude. High craving levels were associated with larger LPP amplitudes at central electrode sites in the right hemisphere. These findings are in line with theories linking motivational aspects and appetitive stimulus processing. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that ERPs are a useful index to assess motivational properties of stimuli in cocaine-dependent patients. These findings suggest that electrophysiological measures may have clinical relevance in substance use disorders.

Differential effects of alcohol, cocaine, and opioid abuse on event-related potentials recorded during a response competition task.	DOI: 10.1016/s0376-8716(01)00190-9	The present study examined the abilities of cocaine-dependent and opioid-dependent patients and healthy, non-dependent volunteers to execute a task requiring rapid shifts in cognitive set. Sixty-six residential treatment program patients, characterized by a history of either cocaine (n=37) or opioid (n=29) dependence, and 18 non-drug-dependent community volunteers were evaluated. The task involved the execution of right- or left-hand button press responses that were either spatially-compatible or incompatible with a directional cue. Performance and event-related electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were recorded throughout the task. Analyses revealed that button press responses were significantly slower and less accurate for all of the groups when spatial conflict was introduced. The amplitude of a slow EEG potential (SP), emerging approximately 500 ms after stimulus onset, showed the normal effect of spatial conflict for the opioid-dependent and non-dependent groups, but not for subjects in the cocaine-dependent group. Correlational analyses restricted to data from the cocaine-dependent group showed that this abnormal SP amplitude was not related to the quantity, frequency, or recency of their cocaine use; it only correlated with their comorbid alcohol use. The results of the major analyses, in combination with the results of a neuroanatomical localization algorithm applied to the SP data, suggest that comorbid alcohol use disrupts normal task-related activation of the anterior cingulate, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex. The present results have implications for the assessment of specific cognitive problems which could foster drug abuse.

Effect of nitrite on the electroencephalographic activity in the healthy brain.	DOI: 10.1016/j.niox.2019.06.002	Nitrite is a major intravascular store for nitric oxide. The conversion of nitrite to the active nitric oxide occurs mainly under hypoxic conditions to increase blood flow where it is needed the most. The use of nitrite is, therefore, being evaluated widely to reduce the brain injury in conditions resulting in cerebral hypoxia, such as cardiac arrest, ischaemic stroke or subarachnoid haemorrhage. However, as it is still unknown how exogenous nitrite affects the brain activity of healthy individuals, it is difficult to clearly understand how it affects the ischaemic brain.

Identification of Methamphetamine Abusers Can Be Supported by EEG-Based Wavelet Transform and BiLSTM Networks.	DOI: 10.1007/s10548-024-01062-2	Methamphetamine (MA) is a neurological drug, which is harmful to the overall brain cognitive function when abused. Based on this property of MA, people can be divided into those with MA abuse and healthy people. However, few studies to date have investigated automatic detection of MA abusers based on the neural activity. For this reason, the purpose of this research was to investigate the difference in the neural activity between MA abusers and healthy persons and accordingly discriminate MA abusers. First, we performed event-related potential (ERP) analysis to determine the time range of P300. Then, the wavelet coefficients of the P300 component were extracted as the main features, along with the time and frequency domain features within the selected P300 range to classify. To optimize the feature set, F_score was used to remove features below the average score. Finally, a Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (BiLSTM) network was performed for classification. The experimental result showed that the detection accuracy of BiLSTM could reach 83.85%. In conclusion, the P300 component of EEG signals of MA abusers is different from that in normal persons. Based on this difference, this study proposes a novel way for the prevention and diagnosis of MA abuse.

Assessment of rTMS treatment effects for methamphetamine use disorder based on EEG microstates.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bbr.2024.114959	Microstates have been proposed as topographical maps representing large-scale resting-state networks and have recently been suggested as markers for methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). However, it is unknown whether and how they change after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) intervention. This study included a comprehensive subject population to investigate the effect of rTMS on MUD microstates. 34 patients with MUD underwent a 4-week randomized, double-blind rTMS intervention (active=17, sham=17). Two resting-state EEG recordings and VAS evaluations were conducted before and after the intervention period. Additionally, 17 healthy individuals were included as baseline controls. The modified k-means clustering method was used to calculate four microstates (MS-A∼MS-D) of EEG, and the FC network was also analyzed. The differences in microstate indicators between groups and within groups were compared. The durations of MS-A and MS-B microstates in patients with MUD were significantly lower than that in HC but showed significant improvements after rTMS intervention. Changes in microstate indicators were found to be significantly correlated with changes in craving level. Furthermore, selective modulation of the resting-state network by rTMS was observed in the FC network. The findings indicate that changes in microstates in patients with MUD are associated with craving level improvement following rTMS, suggesting they may serve as valuable evaluation markers.

Dysfunctional feedback processing in male methamphetamine abusers: Evidence from neurophysiological and computational approaches.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2024.108847	Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) as a major public health risk is associated with dysfunctional neural feedback processing. Although dysfunctional feedback processing in people who are substance dependent has been explored in several behavioral, computational, and electrocortical studies, this mechanism in MUDs requires to be well understood. Furthermore, the current understanding of latent components of their behavior such as learning speed and exploration-exploitation dilemma is still limited. In addition, the association between the latent cognitive components and the related neural mechanisms also needs to be explored. Therefore, in this study, the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms of feedback processing of such impairment, and age/gender-matched healthy controls are evaluated within a probabilistic learning task with rewards and punishments. Mathematical modeling results based on the Q-learning paradigm suggested that MUDs show less sensitivity in distinguishing optimal options. Additionally, it may be worth noting that MUDs exhibited a slight decrease in their ability to learn from negative feedback compared to healthy controls. Also through the lens of underlying neural mechanisms, MUDs showed lower theta power at the medial-frontal areas while responding to negative feedback. However, other EEG measures of reinforcement learning including feedback-related negativity, parietal-P300, and activity flow from the medial frontal to lateral prefrontal regions, remained intact in MUDs. On the other hand, the elimination of the linkage between value sensitivity and medial-frontal theta activity in MUDs was observed. The observed dysfunction could be due to the adverse effects of methamphetamine on the cortico-striatal dopamine circuit, which is reflected in the anterior cingulate cortex activity as the most likely region responsible for efficient behavior adjustment. These findings could help us to pave the way toward tailored therapeutic approaches.

Neural complexity is increased after low doses of LSD, but not moderate to high doses of oral THC or methamphetamine.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-024-01809-2	Neural complexity correlates with one's level of consciousness. During coma, anesthesia, and sleep, complexity is reduced. During altered states, including after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), complexity is increased. In the present analysis, we examined whether low doses of LSD (13 and 26 µg) were sufficient to increase neural complexity in the absence of altered states of consciousness. In addition, neural complexity was assessed after doses of two other drugs that significantly altered consciousness and mood: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 7.5 and 15 mg) and methamphetamine (MA; 10 and 20 mg). In three separate studies (N = 73; 21, LSD; 23, THC; 29, MA), healthy volunteers received placebo or drug in a within-subjects design over three laboratory visits. During anticipated peak drug effects, resting state electroencephalography (EEG) recorded Limpel-Ziv complexity and spectral power. LSD, but not THC or MA, dose-dependently increased neural complexity. LSD also reduced delta and theta power. THC reduced, and MA increased, alpha power, primarily in frontal regions. Neural complexity was not associated with any subjective drug effect; however, LSD-induced reductions in delta and theta were associated with elation, and THC-induced reductions in alpha were associated with altered states. These data inform relationships between neural complexity, spectral power, and subjective states, demonstrating that increased neural complexity is not necessary or sufficient for altered states of consciousness. Future studies should address whether greater complexity after low doses of LSD is related to cognitive, behavioral, or therapeutic outcomes, and further examine the role of alpha desynchronization in mediating altered states of consciousness.

Amphetamine increases motivation of humans and mice as measured by breakpoint, but does not affect an Electroencephalographic biomarker.	DOI: 10.3758/s13415-023-01150-z	Translation of drug targets from preclinical studies to clinical trials has been aided by cross-species behavioral tasks, but evidence for brain-based engagement during task performance is still required. Cross-species progressive ratio breakpoint tasks (PRBTs) measure motivation-related behavior and are pharmacologically and clinically sensitive. We recently advanced elevated parietal alpha power as a cross-species electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarker of PRBT engagement. Given that amphetamine increases breakpoint in mice, we tested its effects on breakpoint and parietal alpha power in both humans and mice. Twenty-three healthy participants performed the PRBT with EEG after amphetamine or placebo in a double-blind design. C57BL/6J mice were trained on PRBT with EEG (n = 24) and were treated with amphetamine or vehicle. A second cohort of mice was trained on PRBT without EEG (n = 40) and was treated with amphetamine or vehicle. In humans, amphetamine increased breakpoint. In mice, during concomitant EEG, 1 mg/kg of amphetamine significantly decreased breakpoint. In cohort 2, however, 0.3 mg/kg of amphetamine increased breakpoint consistent with human findings. Increased alpha power was observed in both species as they reached breakpoint, replicating previous findings. Amphetamine did not affect alpha power in either species. Amphetamine increased effort in humans and mice. Consistent with previous reports, elevated parietal alpha power was observed in humans and mice as they performed the PRBT. Amphetamine did not affect this EEG biomarker of effort. Hence, these findings support the pharmacological predictive validity of the PRBT to measure effort in humans and mice and suggest that this EEG biomarker is not directly reflective of amphetamine-induced changes in effort.

An electroencephalographic signature predicts craving for methamphetamine.	DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrm.2023.101347	Craving is central to methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) and both characterizes the disease and predicts relapse. However, there is currently a lack of robust and reliable biomarkers for monitoring craving and diagnosing MUD. Here, we seek to identify a neurobiological signature of craving based on individual-level functional connectivity pattern differences between healthy control and MUD subjects. We train high-density electroencephalography (EEG)-based models using data recorded during the resting state and then calculate imaginary coherence features between the band-limited time series across different brain regions of interest. Our prediction model demonstrates that eyes-open beta functional connectivity networks have significant predictive value for craving at the individual level and can also identify individuals with MUD. These findings advance the neurobiological understanding of craving through an EEG-tailored computational model of the brain connectome. Dissecting neurophysiological features provides a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of MUD.

Electroencephalogram pattern association with drug-related cues in a long-duration virtual reality environment in patients with methamphetamine use disorder.	DOI: 10.1111/adb.13248	The cognitive processing of drug-related cues and the subsequent dysregulation of behaviour play a central role in the pathophysiology of substance use disorders. Prior studies are limited by small sample sizes and a lack of immersion in stimulus presentation. In the present study, we recruited patients with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD; N = 1099) from four compulsory isolated detoxification centres and healthy control participants (N = 305). With a 12-min-long virtual reality (VR) protocol stimulus, we discovered that patients showed a decrease in electroencephalogram (EEG) power across alpha to gamma bands in anterior scalp regions under methamphetamine-related VR stimuli (e.g. a glass pipe and medical tubing) compared with the control stimuli (e.g. balls and cubes). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the interaction effects of stimuli type and group were significant in five EEG bands. Using generalised linear models, we classified the stimuli type (i.e. drug-related vs. drug-unrelated cues) in MUD patients with an f1 score of 90% on an out-of-sample testing set. The decreases of EEG between drug-related cues and drug-unrelated cues in delta, theta and alpha frequency bands are more frequently seen in patients than in healthy controls, perhaps reflecting general arousal and attenuated impulsive control. Our results suggest that EEG responses elicited by long-duration methamphetamine-related VR cues showed a specific signature, which may have future clinical implications.

Impaired Brain-Heart Relation in Patients With Methamphetamine Use Disorder During VR Induction of Drug Cue Reactivity.	DOI: 10.1109/JTEHM.2022.3206333	Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is an illness associated with severe health consequences. Virtual reality (VR) is used to induce the drug-cue reactivity and significant EEG and ECG abnormalities were found in MUD patients. However, whether a link exists between EEG and ECG abnormalities in patients with MUD during exposure to drug cues remains unknown. This is important from the therapeutic viewpoint because different treatment strategies may be applied when EEG abnormalities and ECG irregularities are complications of MUD. We designed a VR system with drug cues and EEG and ECG were recorded during VR exposure. Sixteen patients with MUD and sixteen healthy subjects were recruited. Statistical tests and Pearson correlation were employed to analyze the EEG and ECG. The results showed that, during VR induction, the patients with MUD but not healthy controls showed significant [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] power increases when the stimulus materials were most intense. This finding indicated that the stimuli are indiscriminate to healthy controls but meaningful to patients with MUD. Five heart rate variability (HRV) indexes significantly differed between patients and controls, suggesting abnormalities in the reaction of patient's autonomic nervous system. Importantly, significant relations between EEG and HRV indexes changes were only identified in the controls, but not in MUD patients, signifying a disruption of brain-heart relations in patients. Our findings of stimulus-specific EEG changes and the impaired brain-heart relations in patients with MUD shed light on the understanding of drug-cue reactivity and may be used to design diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies for MUD.

Neuronal Abnormalities Induced by an Intelligent Virtual Reality System for Methamphetamine Use Disorder.	DOI: 10.1109/JBHI.2022.3154759	Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a brain disease that leads to altered regional neuronal activity. Virtual reality (VR) is used to induce the drug cue reactivity. Previous studies reported significant frequency-specific neuronal abnormalities in patients with MUD during VR induction of drug craving. However, whether those patients exhibit neuronal abnormalities after VR induction that could serve as the treatment target remains unclear. Here, we used an integrated VR system for inducing drug related changes and investigated the neuronal abnormalities after VR exposure in patients. Fifteen patients with MUD and ten healthy subjects were recruited and exposed to drug-related VR environments. Resting-state EEG were recorded for 5 minutes twice-before and after VR and transformed to obtain the frequency-specific data. Three self-reported scales for measurement of the anxiety levels and impulsivity of participants were obtained after VR task. Statistical tests and machine learning methods were employed to reveal the differences between patients and healthy subjects. The result showed that patients with MUD and healthy subjects significantly differed in Θ, α, and γ power changes after VR. These neuronal abnormalities in patients were associated with the self-reported behavioral scales, indicating impaired impulse control. Our findings of resting-state EEG abnormalities in patients with MUD after VR exposure have the translational value and can be used to develop the treatment strategies for methamphetamine use disorder.

EEG reveals that dextroamphetamine improves cognitive control through multiple processes in healthy participants.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-021-01257-2	The poor translatability between preclinical and clinical drug trials has limited pro-cognitive therapeutic development. Future pro-cognitive drug trials should use translatable cross-species cognitive tasks with biomarkers (1) relevant to specific cognitive constructs, and (2) sensitive to drug treatment. Here, we used a difficulty-modulated variant of a cross-species cognitive control task with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) to identify neurophysiological biomarkers sensitive to the pro-cognitive effects of dextroamphetamine (d-amp) (10 or 20 mg) in healthy adults (n = 23), in a randomized, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, double blind, within-subject study, conducted across three test days each separated by one week. D-amp boosted d-prime, sped reaction time, and increased frontal P3a amplitude to non-target correct rejections independent of task difficulty. Task difficulty did however, moderate d-amp effects on EEG during target performance. D-amp suppressed frontal theta power during easy target responses which negatively correlated with drug-induced improvement in hit rate while d-amp-induced changes in P3b amplitude during hard target trials strongly correlated with drug-induced improvement in hit rate. In summary, d-amp affected both behavioral and neurophysiological measures of cognitive control elements. Under low-demand, d-amp diminished cognitive control by suppressing theta, yet under high-demand it boosted control in concert with higher P3b amplitudes. These findings thus appear to reflect a gain-sharpening effect of d-amp: during high-demand processes were boosted while during low-demand processes were neglected. Future studies will use these neurophysiological measures of cognitive control as biomarkers to predict d-amp sensitivity in people with cognitive control deficits, including schizophrenia.

Machine learning of EEG spectra classifies unconsciousness during GABAergic anesthesia.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0246165	In current anesthesiology practice, anesthesiologists infer the state of unconsciousness without directly monitoring the brain. Drug- and patient-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness have been identified previously. We applied machine learning approaches to construct classification models for real-time tracking of unconscious state during anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. We used cross-validation to select and train the best performing models using 33,159 2s segments of EEG data recorded from 7 healthy volunteers who received increasing infusions of propofol while responding to stimuli to directly assess unconsciousness. Cross-validated models of unconsciousness performed very well when tested on 13,929 2s EEG segments from 3 left-out volunteers collected under the same conditions (median volunteer AUCs 0.99-0.99). Models showed strong generalization when tested on a cohort of 27 surgical patients receiving solely propofol collected in a separate clinical dataset under different circumstances and using different hardware (median patient AUCs 0.95-0.98), with model predictions corresponding with actions taken by the anesthesiologist during the cases. Performance was also strong for 17 patients receiving sevoflurane (alone or in addition to propofol) (median AUCs 0.88-0.92). These results indicate that EEG spectral features can predict unconsciousness, even when tested on a different anesthetic that acts with a similar neural mechanism. With high performance predictions of unconsciousness, we can accurately monitor anesthetic state, and this approach may be used to engineer infusion pumps to intelligibly respond to patients' neural activity.

Enhanced neural responses to monetary rewards in methamphetamine use disordered individuals compared to healthy controls.	DOI: 10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.08.003	Converging evidence supports that addiction involves the pathological usurpation of normal reward processes. However, the nature and direction of reward processing dysfunction in substance abusers remain unclear. The current study explored the electrophysiological responses associated with different stages of reward processing in methamphetamine (MA) use disordered individuals. Electroencephalography recording was used to compare responses of 21 MA use disordered individuals and 22 healthy controls (HC) while participants engaged in a simple gambling task. Compared to HC, MA use disordered individuals made more risky choices following a loss outcome on a previous trial. During the reward anticipatory stage, MA use disordered individuals showed an enhanced stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN), as compared to HC. During the reward outcome stage, MA use disordered individuals showed an enhanced feedback-related negativity (FRN) for the losses versus gains as compared to HC. Furthermore, an enhanced P300 was observed under the gain condition, but not under the loss condition, in MA use disordered individuals as compared to HC. These findings provide further evidence that MA use disordered individuals have a sensitized neural response to non-drug rewards and support the impulsivity and incentive sensitization theories in MA use disordered individuals. The current study helps to elucidate the neural mechanisms of reward processing in MA use disordered individuals.

Methamphetamine-associated difficulties in cognitive control allocation may normalize after prolonged abstinence.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.06.015	Chronic heavy methamphetamine use likely causes dopaminergic neurotoxicity, which is commonly thought to result in cognitive control deficits. Both of these alterations may persist even after the use is discontinued, but tend to (partly) improve with increasing duration of abstinence. While several studies have demonstrated that the reinstatement of comparatively normal dopaminergic signaling may take months, if not years, the amelioration of cognitive deficits has predominantly been investigated in much shorter intervals of several weeks to less than half a year. Against this background, we set out to investigate the effects on prolonged abstinence in n = 27 abstinent former methamphetamine users in a cross-sectional design using behavioral and neurophysiological measures of cognitive control. Our behavioral results suggest that former users struggled to identify and adapt to different degrees of cognitive control requirements, which made their behavioral performance less expedient than that of healthy controls. On the neurophysiological level, this was reflected by reduced modulations of the N2-N450 amplitude in response to high vs. low cognitive control requirements. Yet, those effects could only be observed in methamphetamine users who had been abstinent for a relatively short time (mean 9.9; max. 18 months), but not in former users who had been abstinent two years or longer. While this finding alone does not allow for causal inferences, it suggests that the amelioration of control deficits may take longer than what is commonly investigated (1-6 months). Hence, some of the statements about permanent/irreversible dopamine-dependent executive dysfunctions in former methamphetamine users should be interpreted with caution.

The effects of dexamphetamine on the resting-state electroencephalogram and functional connectivity.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.23052	The catecholamines-dopamine and noradrenaline-play important roles in directing and guiding behavior. Disorders of these systems, particularly within the dopamine system, are associated with several severe and chronically disabling psychiatric and neurological disorders. We used the recently published group independent components analysis (ICA) procedure outlined by Chen et al. (2013) to present the first pharmaco-EEG ICA analysis of the resting-state EEG in healthy participants administered 0.45 mg/kg dexamphetamine. Twenty-eight healthy participants between 18 and 41 were recruited. Bayesian nested-domain models that explicitly account for spatial and functional relationships were used to contrast placebo and dexamphetamine on component spectral power and several connectivity metrics. Dexamphetamine led to reductions across delta, theta, and alpha spectral power bands that were predominantly localized to Frontal and Central regions. Beta 1 and beta 2 power were reduced by dexamphetamine at Frontal ICs, while beta 2 and gamma power was enhanced by dexamphetamine in posterior regions, including the parietal, occipital-temporal, and occipital regions. Power-power coupling under dexamphetamine was similar for both states, resembling the eyes open condition under placebo. However, orthogonalized measures of power coupling and phase coupling did not show the same effect of dexamphetamine as power-power coupling. We discuss the alterations of low- and high-frequency EEG power in response to dexamphetamine within the context of disorders of dopamine regulation, in particular schizophrenia, as well as in the context of a recently hypothesized association between low-frequency power and aspects of anhedonia.

Dopamine and gamma band synchrony in schizophrenia--insights from computational and empirical studies.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08071.x	Dopamine modulates cortical circuit activity in part through its actions on GABAergic interneurons, including increasing the excitability of fast-spiking interneurons. Though such effects have been demonstrated in single cells, there are no studies that examine how such mechanisms may lead to the effects of dopamine at a neural network level. With this motivation, we investigated the effects of dopamine on synchronization in a simulated neural network composed of excitatory and fast-spiking inhibitory Wang-Buzsaki neurons. The effects of dopamine were implemented through varying leak K+ conductance of the fast-spiking interneurons and the network synchronization within the gamma band (∼40 Hz) was analyzed. Parametrically varying the leak K+ conductance revealed an inverted-U shaped relationship, with low gamma band power at both low and high conductance levels and optimal synchronization at intermediate conductance levels. We also examined the effects of modulating excitability of the inhibitory neurons more generically using an idealized model with theta neurons, with similar findings. Moreover, such a relationship holds when the external input is both tonic and periodic. Our computational results mirror our empirical study of dopamine modulation in schizophrenia and healthy controls, which showed that amphetamine administration increased gamma power in patients but decreased it in controls. Together, our computational and empirical investigations indicate that dopamine can modulate cortical gamma band synchrony in an inverted-U fashion and that the physiologic effects of dopamine on single fast-spiking interneurons can give rise to such non-monotonic effects at the network level.

Decreased cortical complexity in methamphetamine abusers.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2011.07.009	"This study aimed to investigate if methamphetamine (MA) abusers exhibit alterations in complexity of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and to determine if these possible alterations are associated with their abuse patterns. EEGs were recorded from 48 former MA-dependent males and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Approximate Entropy (ApEn), an information-theoretical measure of irregularity, of the EEGs was estimated to quantify the degree of cortical complexity. The ApEn values in MA abusers were significantly lower than those of healthy subjects in most of the cortical regions, indicating decreased cortical complexity of MA abusers, which may be associated with impairment in specialization and integration of cortical activities owing to MA abuse. Moreover, ApEn values exhibited significant correlations with the clinical factors including abuse patterns, symptoms of psychoses, and their concurrent drinking and smoking habits. These findings provide insights into abnormal information processing in MA abusers and suggest that ApEn of EEG recordings may be used as a potential supplementary tool for quantitative diagnosis of MA abuse.

Dexamphetamine reduces auditory P3 delta power and phase-locking while increasing gamma power.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2012.02.009	Auditory P3 amplitude reduction is one of the most robust and replicated findings in schizophrenia. Recent evidence suggests that these reductions are due to reductions in both power and phase-locking at delta and theta frequencies. We have previously shown that the auditory, but not visual, P3 is reduced in healthy participants given the catecholamine releasing agent dexamphetamine. Our aim was to determine whether the auditory P3 amplitude reduction induced by dexamphetamine has similar power and phase locking characteristics to that seen in schizophrenia. Forty-four healthy participants were given 0.45 mg/kg dexamphetamine and placebo, in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. The task was a three-stimulus auditory odd-ball task, target stimuli were the major stimuli of interest. Individual target trials underwent wavelet analysis to give power and phase-locking of delta (3 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequencies for a 50 ms time window centred around the peak of the target P3. Delta power around the P3 peak was significantly reduced when participants were given dexamphetamine. Delta phase-locking was also reduced but only when analysis was targeted at the location of the peak P3 amplitude. In contrast, theta power and phase-locking were not affected by dexamphetamine. These findings suggest that increased catecholamine activity may be responsible for the power and phase-locking reductions of the auditory P3 delta component in patients with schizophrenia. Interestingly, dexamphetamine significantly increased gamma power around the P3 peak. We attempt to link this finding with the gamma alterations that have been found in patients with schizophrenia.

The acute effects of d-amphetamine and d-methamphetamine on ERP components in humans.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2011.11.009	While a number of behavioural studies have been conducted to investigate the acute effects of amphetamines on tasks of attention and information processing, there is currently a scarcity of research concerning their electrophysiological effects in healthy adults. It is also unclear as to whether amphetamines exert effects on stimulus evaluation or response selection. In two studies, independent groups of twenty healthy illicit stimulant users aged between 21 and 32 years were administered 0.42 mg/kg d-amphetamine versus placebo, and 0.42 mg/kg d-methamphetamine versus placebo respectively, and completed an auditory oddball task on two separate testing days. A 62-channel EEG was recorded during the completion of the task, and the effects of amphetamines on N200 and P300 ERP components were analysed. d-amphetamine significantly decreased reaction time, improved accuracy, and reduced the latency of the P300 component relative to placebo, while having no effect on the N200 component. d-methamphetamine had no effect on reaction time, accuracy or the P300 component, but reduced the amplitude of the N200 component, relative to placebo. It was concluded that there is tentative support to suggest that d-amphetamine at a dose of 0.42 mg/kg may enhance speed of information processing while d-methamphetamine at a dose of 0.42 mg/kg may reflect changes to stimulus evaluation.

Mismatch negativity in methamphetamine dependence: a pilot study.	DOI: 10.55782/ane-2008-1677	The objective of this study was to verify hypothesised changes in event related potentials (visual mismatch negativity, vMMN) in 17 subjects dependent on methamphetamine (MAMP) compared to age and gender matched 17 healthy volunteers. We found a significant correlation between vMMN and duration of methamphetamine abuse (Spearman correlation coefficient r=0.54-0.78; P<.05). The positive correlation indicates drop of originally more negative response to deviant stimulus, what may indicate a pre-attentive processing enhancement in the first years of MAMP abuse with its decease later on. Accordingly, post-hoc analysis revealed significantly stronger vMMN in patients with length of MAMP abuse shorter than 5 years than in paired controls. There were no such differences in abusers with the length of abuse longer than 5 years. The results show that the visual processing on the pre-attentional level can be influenced by long-term MAMP abuse, what can be specifically assessed by vMMN.

Distinctive effects of modafinil and d-amphetamine on the homeostatic and circadian modulation of the human waking EEG.	DOI: 10.1007/s00213-002-1315-8	Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent that affects hypothalamic structures involved in the homeostatic and circadian regulation of vigilance. Administered during sleep deprivation, it reduces the need for prolonged recovery sleep and decreases the rebound in EEG slow-wave activity. These diachronic effects suggest an action of modafinil on a homeostatic sleep regulatory process.

Localization of MDMA-induced brain activity in healthy volunteers using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA).	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.1049	3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'Ecstasy') is a psychostimulant drug producing heightened mood and facilitated social communication. In animal studies, MDMA effects are primarily mediated by serotonin (5-HT), but also by dopamine (DA) and possibly noradrenaline (NA). In humans, however, the neurochemical and neurophysiological basis of acute MDMA effects remains unknown. The distribution of active neuronal populations after administration of a single dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg) or placebo was studied in 16 healthy, MDMA-naïve volunteers. Thirty-one-channel scalp EEGs during resting with open and closed eyes was analyzed in the different EEG frequency bands. Scalp maps of power showed significant, global differences between MDMA and placebo in both eye conditions and all frequency bands. Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to compute 3D, functional images of electric neuronal activity from the scalp EEG data. MDMA produced a widespread decrease of slow and medium frequency activity and an increase of fast frequency activity in the anterior temporal and posterior orbital cortex, concomitant with a marked enhancement of mood, emotional arousal and increased extraversion. This activation of frontotemporal areas indicates that the observed enhancement of mood and possibly the increased extroversion rely on modulation of limbic orbitofrontal and anterotemporal structures known to be involved in emotional processes. Comparison of the MDMA-specific EEG pattern with that of various 5-HT, DA, and NA agonists indicates that serotonin, noradrenaline, and, to a lesser degree, dopamine, contribute to the effects of MDMA on EEG, and possibly also on mood and behavior.

Comparison of methods for the assessment of central nervous system stimulant response after dextroamphetamine administration to healthy male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/009127009603601108	The objective of this investigation was to evaluate a series of potential pharmacodynamic measures of central nervous system stimulation, including quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroendocrine, mood, and psychomotor performance measures. The reproducibility and sensitivity of the measures were compared. The study was conducted in two parts. The first part investigated the interindividual and intraindividual variability associated with a series of potential pharmacologic response measures under baseline (i.e., drug-free) conditions. It was an open-label, three-period pilot study in which healthy male volunteers underwent a series of tests (EEG, a visual continuous performance task, a finger tapping task, and self-rated mood scales) repeatedly during each study period. The second part evaluated the sensitivity of a series of potential response measures to detect the effects of dextroamphetamine, and was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period crossover study in nine healthy male volunteers. Subjects received 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg of dextroamphetamine or placebo orally and underwent the same series of tests as in Part I in addition to blood collection for determination of serum prolactin and dextroamphetamine levels. Peripheral response to dextroamphetamine was assessed by heart rate and blood pressure measurement. The greatest variability among days, within days, and among participants was associated with the quantitative electroencephalographic parameters studied. First-session effects were apparent for several of the tests, including EEG. Consistent response on EEG (increased alpha power) to dextroamphetamine was observed only in the three subjects who had a baseline alpha activity greater than 35%. Serum prolactin levels were inversely associated with the amount of dextroamphetamine administered, with the largest decrease in serum prolactin levels observed after the 5-mg dose, and this finding was statistically significant. Mood scales showed that three of nine participants experienced dysphoria after at least one dose level of dextroamphetamine. The effect on mood was generally greater as the dose increased. Doses could not be distinguished based on the results of the performance tests. Serum prolactin concentration was the most sensitive measure of central nervous system stimulation on EEG produced by dextroamphetamine under these study conditions. Cardiovascular measures were more sensitive measures of dextroamphetamine effects than the central nervous system measures.

Clinical-pharmacological study with the two isomers (d-, l-) of fenfluramine and its comparison with chlorpromazine and d-amphetamine: blood levels, EEG mapping and safety evaluation.		In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, the blood levels and pharmacodynamic properties of single oral doses of 15 and 30 mg d-fenfluramine (d-FEN) and 30 mg l-fenfluramine (l-FEN) were investigated as compared with 50 mg chlorpromazine (CPZ) and 20 mg d-amphetamine (AMPH) utilizing pharmaco-electroencephalogram (EEG) mapping as well as prolactin and safety assessments. Eighteen healthy young volunteers randomly (Latin square) received at weekly intervals the different treatments. Blood sampling to determine AMPH, FEN and its main metabolite norFEN, as well as plasma prolactic levels, EEG recordings and evaluation of hemodynamics and spontaneous side effects were carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after drug administration. Before and 24 h after drug intake morning subjective sleep quality was also assessed. Blood level investigations after d-FEN demonstrated dose-dependent blood concentrations peaking after 2-4 h and slowly declining thereafter. NorFEN, the main metabolite, exhibited a steady increase in plasma concentrations up to the 8th h. After l-FEN a similar time course was obtained but the concentrations of the parent compound were higher and those of the metabolite lower in comparison with the d-isomer, suggesting stereoselective kinetics. d-FEN induced significant and dose-dependent pharmaco-EEG changes characterized by a decrease in total power and combined delta/theta activity and by an increase in beta activity and an acceleration of the centroid of the total activity with no changes in alpha power, which were quite different from those of the reference drugs. l-FEN produced only minimal changes (of the same type as d-FEN). 50 mg CPZ and 20 mg d-AMPH produced significant changes as compared to placebo but with quite opposite patterns, the former exhibiting the typical sedative-neuroleptic profile and the latter that typical of psychostimulants. Dose/treatment- and time-efficacy calculations based on all variables showed in the V-EEG that only 30 mg d-FEN and 50 mg CPZ were different from placebo (with peak effects in the 8th and 4th h, respectively), while in the resting condition (R-EEG) all drugs/dosages but 30 mg l-FEN differed from placebo (with the peak effect occurring in the 4th-6th h after d-FEN and l-FEN, in the 2nd h after CPZ and in the 4th-6th h after AMPH).

Effect of dexfenfluramine on sleep in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02244312	The acute effects of dexfenfluramine on nocturnal sleep were studied in ten healthy male subjects by means of sleep EEG recordings and ratings of subjective sleep quality. Four different dosages (3 mg, 7 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg) were tested, administered over a period of 3 days each. Under 15 mg and 30 mg dexfenfluramine, only slight effects on sleep were observed: 15 mg led to decreased sleep efficiency in the first night of medication, and to reduced percentage of slow wave sleep in the first and third night. A significant lengthening of REM latency was present in the third night under 30 mg dexfenfluramine, without changes in other REM sleep parameters. Daily doses of 3 mg and 7 mg dexfenfluramine did not influence sleep, except for a significant REM latency reduction observed in the first night under 3 mg. Apart from a transient slight impairment under 30 mg, ratings of subjective sleep quality did not mirror any impact of dexfenfluramine. The data suggest that therapeutic dosages of dexfenfluramine only slightly influence nocturnal sleep, which contrasts with the known impact of other anti-obesity agents like the amphetamines. Unlike classical antidepressants, dexfenfluramine does not reduce REM sleep; in light of a hypothetical link between REM sleep reduction and antidepressant action of a drug, dexfenfluramine is not expected to have a pronounced antidepressant effect.

Resting-state occipital alpha power is associated with treatment outcome in patients with chronic migraine.	DOI: 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002516	Preventive treatment is crucial for patients with chronic migraine (CM). This study explored the association between resting-state cortical oscillations and 3-month treatment outcome in patients with CM. Treatment-naïve patients with CM were recruited with their demographic data, psychosocial data, and headache profiles as well as the healthy controls (HCs). Resting-state cortical activities were recorded using an electroencephalogram and analysed using source-based and electrode-based spectral power method. The regions of interest were the bilateral primary somatosensory (S1) and visual (V1) cortices. After 3-month treatment with flunarizine, patients with CM were categorized into responders and nonresponders. Demographic, clinical, and electroencephalogram data from 72 patients with CM and 50 HCs were analysed. Elevated anxiety, depression, and stress were observed in patients with CM. Theta power in bilateral S1 and alpha and gamma powers in the right S1 increased in patients with CM. Nonresponders (n = 34) exhibited larger alpha powers in bilateral V1 than those in responders (n = 38). Alpha powers also exhibited significant correlations with changes of monthly headache days. Notably, in responders and nonresponders, occipital alpha powers did not differ at baseline and in the third month. In conclusion, patients with CM who were not responsive to preventive treatment were associated with augmented resting-state occipital alpha activity. Moreover, changes in migraine attack frequency were associated with baseline occipital alpha power. However, the prognostic feature of visual alpha oscillation seems to be inherent because it is not altered by flunarizine treatment. These findings may be useful for developing personalised migraine treatment plans.

Hexarelin decreases slow-wave sleep and stimulates the secretion of GH, ACTH, cortisol and prolactin during sleep in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/S0306-4530(03)00152-5	Ghrelin, the endogenous ligand of the growth hormone (GH) secretagogue (GHS) receptor and some GHSs exert different effects on sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and sleep-related hormone secretion in humans. Similar to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) ghrelin promotes slow-wave sleep in humans, whereas GH-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6) enhances stage 2 nonrapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS). As GHRP-6, hexarelin is a synthetic GHS. Hexarelin is superior to GHRH and GHRP-6 in stimulating GH release. The influence of hexarelin on sleep-endocrine activity and the immune system is unknown. We investigated simultaneously the sleep EEG and nocturnal profiles of GH, ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and soluble TNF-alpha receptors in seven young normal volunteers after repetitive administration of 4 x 50 microg hexarelin or placebo at 22.00, 23.00, 24.00 and 01.00 h. Following hexarelin, stage 4 sleep during the first half of the night, and EEG delta power during the total night decreased significantly. Significant increases of the concentrations of GH and prolactin during the total night, and of ACTH and of cortisol during the first half of the night were found. Leptin levels, TNF-alpha and soluble TNF receptors remained unchanged. We hypothesize that sleep is impaired after hexarelin since the GHRH/corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) ratio is changed in favour of CRH. There are no hints for an interaction of hexarelin and the immune system.

Pharmacokinetics and CNS pharmacodynamics of the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone in humans following acute L-tryptophan depletion challenge.		This study was designed to evaluate the relationship between the pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) and CNS pharmacodynamic(s) (PD) of buspirone, an antidepressant/anxiolytic, in 6 healthy male volunteers placed on an acute L-tryptophan deficient (ATD) diet. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period, three-way crossover study. The first study period was a single-blind familiarization period in which all subjects received placebo. During the remaining three study periods, subjects received either placebo, 10 mg or 30 mg oral buspirone. Subjects were administered the ATD diets 5 h prior to buspirone/placebo administration during each study period. All subjects underwent serial measurements of resting electroencephalography (REEG) and vigilance electroence-phalography (VEEG), cognitive tests, subjective rating scales, and blood was sampled for determination of unbound plasma L-tryptophan, serum prolactin, serum cortisol and plasma buspirone and its active metabolite, 1-pyrimdylpiperazine (1-PP). The ATD diet reduced the unbound plasma L-tryptophan concentrations to 20% of their baseline values. The intraindividual and interindividual variability in the unbound L-tryptophan concentration drop was less than 10% and 15%, respectively. Peak L-tryptophan depletion occurred 5 h after ATD diet was administered; L-tryptophan depletion lasted for approximately 11 h, and L-tryptophan concentrations recovered to baseline values approximately 13 h after administration of the ATD diet. PK-PD analysis for buspirone showed that: 1) peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC infinity) for buspirone following the 10 mg dose in this study were higher than those reported previously in the literature; 2) there was a transient response in the neuroendocrine measures, subjective rating scales and the EEG, but no changes in the cognitive tests with increasing doses of buspirone; 3) the PD measures were correlated with the doses of buspirone, but not with plasma concentrations of buspirone and 1-PP; and 4) the subjective rating scales were the most sensitive indicators of buspirone's CNS effects. This study provides evidence that ATD diet is a simple, specific and non-toxic experimental method to lower plasma L-tryptophan concentrations and thereby (indirectly) deplete brain tryptophan and serotonin (5-HT) concentrations. The ATD challenge may serve as a model of depression in healthy volunteers because of its ability to induce transient symptoms of the disease. Comparison of the results from this study to those reported in the literature suggests that the use of the ATD diet decreases the buspirone-induced neuroendocrine response, increases the buspirone-induced changes in subjective rating scales and, at the same time, increases the systemic exposure to buspirone and 1-PP.

Evening intake of alpha-lactalbumin increases plasma tryptophan availability and improves morning alertness and brain measures of attention.

Loudness Dependence of Auditory-evoked Potentials, a Marker of Central Serotonergic Activity, is Affected by Fasting and Selective Uptake of Food.	DOI: 10.1177/15500594211000925	Serotonin is an important neuromodulator involved in many physiological processes including mood and satiety. In the brain, serotonin is manufactured from tryptophan, as serotonin itself cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Previous research has shown that blood-tryptophan levels increase upon ingestion of carbohydrates and decrease upon protein consumption. How this translates into serotonin availability is as yet under-researched. Therefore, we examined the effect of fasting versus consuming carbohydrates or protein on central serotonergic activity using a repeated-measures crossover design in a sample of 37 healthy men. The loudness dependence of auditory-evoked potentials (LDAEP) serves as a noninvasive method to study central serotonergic activity. Blood-glucose levels and mood changes were also monitored before and after the nutritional intervention. The intervention had a significant nutrition-specific effect on LDAEP and blood-glucose levels. A significant difference emerged between the fasting condition and satiety, with LDAEP being lower during satiety, irrespective of the type of food. Thus, this indicator of serotonergic activity increased after food consumption, which was further related to mood improvement. Moreover, the LDAEP differed between the 2 measurements only for the carbohydrate testing day, suggesting that LDAEP can be selectively modulated by the type of nutrition consumed. Our data further indicate a high intraindividual stability of LDAEP, as the electrophysiological signals were very similar in the fasting condition across the 2 testing days. Together, these findings demonstrate that the LDAEP can serve as a biological marker for central serotonergic activity, while at the same time being sensitive to nutritional changes.

Differential effects of acute serotonin and dopamine depletion on prepulse inhibition and p50 suppression measures of sensorimotor and sensory gating in humans.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1301556	Schizophrenia is associated with impairments of sensorimotor and sensory gating as measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response and P50 suppression of the auditory event-related potential respectively. While serotonin and dopamine play an important role in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia, their role in modulating PPI and P50 suppression in humans is yet to be fully clarified. To further explore the role of serotonin and dopamine in PPI and P50 suppression, we examined the effects of acute tryptophan depletion (to decrease serotonin) and acute tyrosine/phenylalanine depletion (to decrease dopamine) on PPI and P50 suppression in healthy human participants. In addition, we also examined for the first time, the effects of simultaneous serotonin and dopamine depletion (ie combined monoamine depletion) on PPI and P50 suppression. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design in which 16 healthy male participants completed the PPI and P50 paradigms under four acute treatment conditions: (a) balanced/placebo control, (b) acute tryptophan depletion, (c) acute tyrosine/phenylalanine depletion, and (d) acute tyrosine/phenylalanine/tryptophan depletion (combined monoamine depletion). Selective depletion of dopamine had no significant effect on either PPI or P50 suppression, whereas selective serotonin depletion significantly disrupted PPI, but not P50 suppression. Finally, the simultaneous depletion of both serotonin and dopamine resulted in significant reduction of both PPI and P50 suppression. We suggest these results can be explained by theories relating to optimal levels of monoaminergic neurotransmission and synergistic interactions between serotonergic and dopaminergic systems for normal 'gating' function. These findings suggest that a dysfunction in both serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission may, in part, be responsible for the gating deficits observed in schizophrenia, and their normalization following administration of atypical antipsychotic drugs.

Serotonergic modulation of mismatch negativity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2004.09.006	Neurochemical mechanisms mediating the interaction between emotional and cognitive processing are not yet fully understood. Here, we utilized acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) to reduce the brain synthesis of serotonin (5-HT), which is thought to have a central role in regulation of emotions and mood in humans. ATD effects on event-related potentials and magnetic fields were studied using a passive odd-ball paradigm in a randomized, double-blinded, controlled, cross-over design. Auditory responses were recorded simultaneously with high-resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) in 14 healthy subjects, 5 h after ATD or a control condition. ATD significantly increased depressed mood and lowered plasma tryptophan concentration (total tryptophan decreased by 75%, free tryptophan decreased by 39%). As compared with the control condition, ATD increased the amplitudes of mismatch negativity (MMN) to duration and frequency changes and decreased the latencies of magnetic MMN to frequency changes in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ear stimulated. Further, ATD modulated N1m latencies and decreased P2m source activity. ATD increased the interhemispheric latency difference of MMNm to frequency changes. No effects on P50 were observed. The present results suggest serotonergic modulation of preattentive auditory change detection, suggested to initiate involuntary attention shifting in the human brain.

Since serotonin is involved in sleep regulation and assumed to be of high importance in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, the acute polysomnographic effects of tryptophan depletion were studied in healthy subjects and patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). According to the reciprocal interaction model of non-REM and REM-sleep regulation we expected that tryptophan depletion in healthy controls should provoke alterations of sleep similar to depression, whereas we assumed that these effects would be more pronounced in patients with OCD.

Tph2 gene variants modulate response control processes in adult ADHD patients and healthy individuals.	DOI: 10.1038/mp.2008.39	Although therapeutic interventions in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) still focus on the dopaminergic system, recent studies indicate a serotonergic dysfunction in this disease as well. In that respect, several variants of the tryptophan hydroxylase gene (TPH2), which codes for the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin (5-HT), have been associated with ADHD. The rs4570625 G-allele polymorphisms of the TPH2 gene have already been related to altered reactivity of the brain during perception tasks with emotional stimuli in healthy adults. Here we investigated the influence of the ADHD related risk alleles for rs4570625 and for rs11178997 on prefrontal brain function during cognitive response control in large samples of adult ADHD patients (n=124) and healthy controls (n=84). Response control was elicited with a Go-NoGo task (continuous performance test; CPT) performed during recording of an ongoing EEG. From the resulting event-related potentials in the Go- and NoGo conditions of the CPT, the NoGo-anteriorization (NGA) has been calculated as a valid neurophysiological parameter for prefrontal brain function. In the current study, ADHD risk alleles of both polymorphisms were found to be associated with a reduction in the NGA in both healthy controls and ADHD patients. These findings are in line with the notion that genetic variations associated with altered serotonergic neurotransmission are also associated with the function of the prefrontal cortex during response inhibition. This mechanism might also be relevant in the pathophysiology of ADHD.

Tryptophan depletion effects on EEG and MEG responses suggest serotonergic modulation of auditory involuntary attention in humans.	DOI: 10.1006/nimg.2002.1142	Involuntary attention shifting, i.e., detecting and orienting to unexpected stimulus changes, may be altered at low brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) levels. This was studied in 13 healthy subjects (21-30 years old; 6 females) by using a dietary challenge, acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), which decreases 5-HT synthesis in the brain. Five hours after ingestion of either ATD or control mixture (randomized, double-blinded, crossover design), brain responses indexing involuntary attention were measured with simultaneous 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and 122-channel magnetoencephalography (MEG). During the measurement, the subjects were instructed to discriminate equiprobable 200- and 400-ms tones by pressing one of two buttons rapidly. Occasionally, the frequency of the tones changed (10% increase/decrease), causing involuntary attention shifting. ATD significantly lowered plasma tryptophan concentrations (total tryptophan decreased by 75%, free tryptophan decreased by 35%). As compared to the control condition, ATD reduced the amplitude of the deviant-tone N2 wave, including the overlapping mismatch negativity (MMN) and N2b subcomponents, which are suggested to reflect change detection in the brain. The EEG results were accompanied by a significant increase in the peak latency of the magnetic counterpart of MMN. However, no ATD effects were observed in P3 to task-irrelevant frequency change. Reaction time (RT) to deviants per se was not significantly affected, but RT in trials succeeding the deviant-frequency tones was increased by ATD, which suggested impaired reorienting to the task-relevant activity. In conclusion, the results suggest that decreased level of central 5-HT function after ATD may decrease involuntary attention shifting to task-irrelevant sound changes and thus modulate resource allocation to the task-relevant activity.

Serotonin and emotion regulation: the impact of tryptophan depletion on emotional experience, neural and autonomic activity.	DOI: 10.3758/s13415-023-01116-1	The involvement of serotonin in emotion and psychopathology has been extensively examined. Studies using acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) have found limited effects on mood and aggression, and one of the explanations suggests that serotonin may be involved in higher-order functions, such as emotion regulation. However, there is very limited evidence for this hypothesis. The present study investigated the impact of ATD on emotion regulation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. A sample of psychiatrically healthy men (N = 28) completed a cognitive task assessing reappraisal ability (i.e., the success of using reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy, to modulate emotional responses), following ATD and placebo. EEG frontal activity and asymmetry, as well as heart-rate variability (HRV), also were assessed in the reappraisal task. Both frequentist and Bayesian methods were employed for statistical analysis. Results indicated that ATD reduced plasma tryptophan, and reappraisal was effective in modulating emotional experience in the emotion regulation task. However, ATD had no significant effect on reappraisal ability, frontal activity, and HRV. These results offer direct and compelling evidence that decreasing serotonin synthesis through ATD does not alter an emotion regulation ability that is considered crucial in mood and aggression and has been linked with transdiagnostic risk of psychopathology.

Impact of experimentally induced serotonin deficiency by tryptophan depletion on sleep EEG in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1016/S0893-133X(97)00094-8	The tryptophan depletion test is a research strategy to investigate the functional consequences of decreasing the brain serotonin metabolism. Because serotonin is involved in sleep regulation and the regulation of affective states, we studied the acute polysomnographic effects of tryptophan depletion and expected to induce similar changes of sleep EEG as observed in depressed patients. A total of 12 healthy subjects (mean age 34 +/- 3 years) had eight polysomnograms, divided in two blocks of 4 consecutive nights. After one adaptation and 1 baseline night, subjects received a low-protein diet on day 3 and 4 until midday. On day 4 at 18.00 h, they drank an amino acid mixture either devoid of tryptophan or containing 2.3 g of tryptophan (placebo control) in randomized and double-blind order, resulting in an 85% decrease (tryptophan depletion) and a 144% increase (placebo control) of serum tryptophan at 22.00 h. After tryptophan depletion but not placebo, significant effects on sleep EEG were observed in terms of decreased non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) stage 2, increase of wake %, and of rapid eye movement (REM) density compared with baseline. REM latency was not altered, however the first and second REM period interval were significantly shorter after tryptophan depletion. This study underlines the impact of the serotonergic system on sleep maintenance and on REM sleep.

Sleep in obsessive compulsive disorder: polysomnographic studies under baseline conditions and after experimentally induced serotonin deficiency.	DOI: 10.1007/s00406-006-0708-9	Several lines of evidence suggest that brain serotonergic systems may be disturbed in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The serotonergic system strongly affects sleep and characteristic abnormalities of sleep are documented in depression. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate sleep structure of OCD patients in order to evaluate whether similar changes as in depression are present. Up to now, this issue has been addressed only in few studies with small numbers of patients. Sleep patterns of 62 unmedicated patients with primary OCD and 62 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were investigated by polysomnography. Additionally, the impact of tryptophan depletion on sleep was studied in a subgroup of 12 OCD patients and 12 controls. The OCD patients exhibited moderate, but significant disturbances of sleep continuity measures but no abnormalities of slow wave sleep or REM sleep, except a significant elevation of 1st REM density. Tryptophan depletion induced a worsening of sleep continuity, but no changes of REM sleep or slow wave sleep. Assuming that changes of sleep architecture indicate underlying neurobiological abnormalities, this study indicates that neurobiological disturbances are different in primary OCD as compared with primary depression.

Role of acetylcholine and serotonin in novelty processing using an oddball paradigm.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bbr.2017.05.031	The processing of novel stimuli is known to take place in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, and is influenced by the cholinergic system. This ability is crucial to help detect changes in the environment and adapt behaviour accordingly. Previous research has shown that acetylcholine (ACh) can interact with serotonin (5-HT) at the hippocampal level, which may have consequences for cognitive functioning. However, little is known about the exact nature of this ACh and 5-HT interaction as well their possible interactive effects on novelty processing. We investigated the interactive role of ACh and 5-HT in novelty processing in healthy young participants. Levels of these neurotransmitters were manipulated with the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden, and with acute tryptophan depletion (ATD). Participants received either placebo, biperiden, ATD, or a combination of both in a double-blind cross-over design. Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while a novelty oddball task was presented. Our results showed that biperiden affected ERP components considered to reflect attentional mechanisms; it increased the P50 amplitude and decreased that of the P200. Furthermore, a decrease of N100 amplitude by ATD was reversed by biperiden. The treatments did not affect the mismatch negativity (MMN) component, which is elicited when a deviant stimulus is presented in a sequence of repetitive stimuli. Importantly, biperiden decreased the amplitude of the ERP component related to novelty processing (P3a). The current study's results did not reveal an interactive effect of ACh and 5-HT on novelty processing. However, the data do suggest that ACh is involved in novelty processing and that it influences basic stimulus processing, without affecting sound-discrimination accuracy.

Neural expression of nicotine's antidepressant properties during tryptophan depletion: an EEG study in healthy volunteers at risk for depression.	DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.06.002	Nicotine amelioration of serotonergically mediated mood dysregulation may contribute to the comorbidity between cigarette smoking and depression, a disorder which is associated with aberrant activation and hemispheric asymmetry in frontal and posterior cortical regions. This randomized, double-blind study in 20 healthy volunteers with a positive family history of depression examined the effects of transdermal nicotine on mood and EEG changes accompanying transient reductions in serotonin induced by acute tryptophan depletion (ATD). Increased self-ratings of depressed mood and elevation in left frontal high alpha power (decreased activation) were evidenced with ATD (vs. balanced mixture) in participants treated with the placebo but not the nicotine treated group. Nicotine alone increased vigor and posterior high alpha bilaterally, and during ATD it prevented the reduction in left frontal high alpha that was evident in the placebo patch group. These findings indicate that in depression prone individuals, nicotine acts to stabilize the mood lowering and associated frontal functional asymmetry elicited by an acute decrease in brain serotonin.

Effects of flurbiprofen enantiomers on pain-related chemo-somatosensory evoked potentials in human subjects.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1995.tb04556.x	1. The aim of the study was to investigate the analgesic effects of flurbiprofen enantiomers using an experimental pain model based on both chemo-somatosensory event-related potentials (CSSERP) and subjective pain ratings. 2. Healthy female volunteers (n = 16, age 23-36 years) participated in a placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind, four-way crossover study. Single doses of (S)-flurbiprofen (50 mg), (R)-flurbiprofen (50 and 100 mg) and placebo were administered orally. Measurements were taken before and 2 h after administration of the medications. During each measurement, 32 painful stimuli of gaseous carbon dioxide (200 ms duration, interval approximately 30 s) of two concentrations (60 and 65% CO2 v/v) were applied to the right nostril. EEG was recorded from five positions and CSSERP were obtained in response to the painful CO2- stimuli. Additionally, subjects rated the perceived intensity of the painful stimuli by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS). 3. The CSSERP-amplitude P2, a measure of analgesic effect, decreased after administration of both (R)- and (S)-flurbiprofen, while it increased after placebo. This was statistically significant at recording positions C4 (P < 0.01) and Fz (P < 0.05). The analgesia-related decreases in evoked potential produced by (R)-flurbiprofen were dose-dependent. Comparing similar doses of (R)- and (S)-flurbiprofen, the decrease in CSSERP-amplitudes produced by the (S)-enantiomer was somewhat more pronounced, indicating a higher analgesic potency. 4. The present data indicate that both enantiomers of flurbiprofen produce analgesic effects. Since (R)-flurbiprofen caused only little toxicity in rats as compared with the (S)-enantiomer or the racemic compound, a reduction of the quantitatively most important side effects in the gastrointestinal tract might be achieved by employing (R)-flurbiprofen in pain therapy.

A comparison of the antinociceptive effects of imipramine, tramadol and anpirtoline.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1994.tb04285.x	The pain relieving properties of imipramine (100 mg orally), tramadol (150 mg orally), and anpirtoline (60 mg orally) were compared in 16 healthy subjects in a cross-over, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study. Anpirtoline exhibits analgesia which is possibly mediated via serotoninergic pathways, whereas tramadol exerts its effects at opioid receptors. The pain-relieving effect of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine may involve both serotoninergic and opioid mechanisms. Chemo-somatosensory event-related potentials (CSSERP) were recorded after painful stimulation of the nasal mucosa with carbon dioxide. Subjects rated the perceived intensity of the stimuli by means of a visual analogue scale. In addition, acoustically evoked responses were recorded, the spontaneous EEG was analyzed in the frequency domain, the subjects' vigilance was assessed in a tracking task, and side effects of the drugs were monitored. Anpirtoline and tramadol produced a decrease of both CSSERP amplitudes and subjective estimates of pain, the effects of the former compound being greater. In contrast, after administration of imipramine no change of CSSERP amplitudes could be detected, whereas the subjective estimate of pain intensity decreased significantly. This was accompanied by a significant decrease of arousal indicating that pain relief produced by acute administration of imipramine was primarily related to its sedation action. The analgesic properties of anpirtoline were demonstrated in man. Tramadol was characterized as a week opioid analgesic. In contrast, imipramine appeared to produce its pain-relieving effects predominantly by non-specific actions. It is hypothesized that different analgesics may change ERP sources in a drug-specific manner.

The sleep structure of patients with anxiety disorders in comparison to that of healthy controls and depressive patients under baseline conditions and after cholinergic stimulation.	DOI: 10.1016/0165-0327(92)90014-w	This study investigated sleep EEG during placebo and after cholinergic stimulation with RS 86 in 36 healthy subjects, 34 patients with major depression and 20 patients with anxiety disorders. Cholinergic stimulation with RS 86 led to a decrease of slow wave sleep and REM latency. RS 86 had a more profound impact on REM latency in patients with major depression than in healthy controls and patients with anxiety disorders. Six out of 36 healthy controls, three out of 20 patients with anxiety disorders and 24 of 34 patients with depression displayed sleep onset REM periods after cholinergic stimulation. Also effects on REM density and duration of the first REM period were more pronounced in major depression. Even in those patients with anxiety disorders and a secondary major depression no depression-like sleep abnormalities could be provoked. The results underline the usefulness of the cholinergic REM induction test to differentiate patients with major depression from those with other psychiatric disorders. The results can be interpreted as further evidence for the cholinergic-aminergic imbalance model of depression and for the reciprocal interaction model of nonREM-REM regulation.

Cholinergic REM sleep induction test in subjects at high risk for psychiatric disorders.	DOI: 10.1016/0006-3223(92)90144-o	The influence of the cholinergic agonist RS 86 on electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep was investigated in 21 healthy members of families identified as being at high risk for psychiatric disorders and in 17 healthy control subjects without any personal or family history of a psychiatric illness. In comparison to the placebo night, the administration of RS 86 led to a shortening of rapid eye movement (REM) latency in both groups. This effect, however, was much more pronounced in the high-risk group, whereas in the control subjects the arousal system and the slow-wave sleep during the first nonREM period were more affected. These observations suggest that the cholinergic action on sleep regulating mechanisms has differing preferential targets in high-risk probands and in control subjects.

ICI 169,369 (2-(2-dimethylamino ethylthio)-3-phenyl quinoline) is a potent selective competitive antagonist of the 5-HT2 receptor in animal models. Effects of ICI 169,369 as single oral doses (80 and 120 mg) separated by 1 week, on the power spectrum of waking EEG, dark adapted pupil responses and sedation score, were studied in a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomised cross over within subject comparison, in six healthy male volunteers. 2. Pupillary responses were measured using a portable infrared pupillometer following 15 min dark adaptation, assessing resting vertical pupil diameter (RPD), light constricted diameter (MPD) and recovered final diameter (FPD) at the end of a 3 s measurement cycle. 3. Both doses of ICI 169,369 produced a mean 36% (range 10-54%) decrease in log 10 power of the waking EEG alpha activity with eyes closed (P less than 0.02), and mean 38% (range 2-86%) increase in theta activity at 2 h compared with placebo. 4. Both 80 and 120 mg doses of ICI 169,369 reduced RPD by approximately 30% from a predose value of 6.25 mm (+/- 0.87; 95% CI) and from placebo values 6.41 mm (+/- 1.06) and 7.48 mm (+/- 1.49) at 3 and 5 h after dosing. MPD was reduced by 50% with the 120 mg dose at 5 h after dosing (placebo 5.2 mm; ICI 169,369 2.7 mm; P less than 0.05).

Experimental and preliminary clinical evidence of an ischemic zone with prolonged negative DC shifts surrounded by a normally perfused tissue belt with persistent electrocorticographic depression.	DOI: 10.1038/jcbfm.2010.40	In human cortex it has been suggested that the tissue at risk is indicated by clusters of spreading depolarizations (SDs) with persistent depression of high-frequency electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity. We here characterized this zone in the ET-1 model in rats using direct current (DC)-ECoG recordings. Topical application of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) induces focal ischemia in a concentration-dependent manner restricted to a region exposed by a cranial window, while a healthy cortex can be studied at a second naïve window. SDs originate in the ET-1-exposed cortex and invade the surrounding tissue. Necrosis is restricted to the ET-1-exposed cortex. In this study, we discovered that persistent depression occurred in both ET-1-exposed and surrounding cortex during SD clusters. However, the ET-1-exposed cortex showed longer-lasting negative DC shifts and limited high-frequency ECoG recovery after the cluster. DC-ECoG recordings of SD clusters with persistent depression from patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were then analyzed for comparison. Limited ECoG recovery was associated with significantly longer-lasting negative DC shifts in a similar manner to the experimental model. These preliminary results suggest that the ischemic zone in rat and human cortex is surrounded by a normally perfused belt with persistently reduced synaptic activity during the acute injury phase.

Twenty-four adult volunteers (15 females and 9 males) were assigned to infusion with either placebo or CCK-4 in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design, with EEG being recorded before and during (10 and 40 min) a 60-min infusion period. No significant treatment differences were observed for absolute EEG power but, compared to placebo, CCK-4 infusion increased asymmetry and reduced coherence of slow-wave activity at midtemporal recording sites.

A direct nose-brain pathway for cortical effects of intranasally administered CCK-8S has been described, although the precise transmission within this pathway is still unknown. The present study compared the effects of two doses of CCK-8S (10 and 20 microg) and placebo after intranasal administration on the LPC of the ERP in healthy male and female subjects to further elucidate mechanisms of this nose-brain pathway. ERPs were recorded in an oddball-paradigm. Results showed that both doses of CCK-8S induced a positive shift of the ERP. This effect did not differ between the 10 and 20 microg dosage of CCK-8S. The results indicate that a saturable mechanism may be responsible for the transmission of CCK-8S from the nose into the brain, since both doses of CCK-8S induced comparable increases of the ERP subcomponents.

In healthy volunteers responses to challenge with cholecystokinin tetrapeptide differ between administration during REM and delta sleep.	DOI: 10.1002/da.1056	This study was designed to examine the sensitivity of different sleep stages to the pharmacological provocation of nocturnal panic attacks by cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4). In a balanced cross-over design, healthy participants were challenged with identical doses of CCK-4 both during REM sleep and during delta sleep. In nine subjects, stimulation with 50 microg CCK-4 during REM sleep failed to elicit a full-blown panic awakening, while the same dose, administered during delta sleep, produced full-blown panic attacks in two participants. Similarly, stimulation of six subjects with 100 microg CCK-4 during REM sleep resulted in only one panic response, whereas four of nine subjects awoke experiencing a panic attack following stimulation with the identical dose during delta sleep. Severity of panic symptomatology, as measured by the self-rated Acute Panic Inventory, was also significantly increased when CCK-4 was administered during delta sleep. CCK-4 can be used as a challenge agent with an abrupt onset of action making it possible to provoke panic attacks precisely during a particular sleep stage. Sensitivity to the panicogenic effects of CCK-4 seems to be higher during delta sleep than REM sleep.

A nose-brain pathway for psychotropic peptides: evidence from a brain evoked potential study with cholecystokinin.	DOI: 10.1016/s0306-4530(96)00012-1	The access of substances to the brain is of particular relevance for the etiology and treatment of psychiatric and neurologic diseases. This study provides functional evidence for a direct access of peptides to the human brain after intranasal administration. Effects were compared of intranasal (IN, 10 micrograms) and intravenous (i.v., 0.25 and 2.5 micrograms) administered cholecystokinin-8 (CCK) on the auditory event related potential (AERP) in 20 healthy subjects. Also, plasma concentration of cortisol and ACTH were monitored. The study was designed as a placebo-controlled, double-blind within-subject cross-over comparison. AERPs were recorded while the subject performed on an attention task (oddball task). Plasma CCK concentrations after IN administration of CCK were comparable to those after i.v. administration of 0.25 microgram CCK, but were substantially lower than those after 2.5 micrograms CCK. The P3 complex of the AERP was markedly increased following the IN administration of CCK (p < .01) compared to placebo and to the i.v. administration of 0.25 microgram. This pattern was more obvious in women than men. Increases in plasma ACTH concentrations after CCK reached significance selectively following the IN mode of administration (p < .01).

Acitretin reverses early functional network degradation in a mouse model of familial Alzheimer's disease.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-021-85912-0	Aberrant activity of local functional networks underlies memory and cognition deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hyperactivity was observed in microcircuits of mice AD-models showing plaques, and also recently in early stage AD mutants prior to amyloid deposition. However, early functional effects of AD on cortical microcircuits remain unresolved. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we found altered temporal distributions (burstiness) in the spontaneous activity of layer II/III visual cortex neurons, in a mouse model of familial Alzheimer's disease (5xFAD), before plaque formation. Graph theory (GT) measures revealed a distinct network topology of 5xFAD microcircuits, as compared to healthy controls, suggesting degradation of parameters related to network robustness. After treatment with acitretin, we observed a re-balancing of those network measures in 5xFAD mice; particularly in the mean degree distribution, related to network development and resilience, and post-treatment values resembled those of age-matched controls. Further, behavioral deficits, and the increase of excitatory synapse numbers in layer II/III were reversed after treatment. GT is widely applied for whole-brain network analysis in human neuroimaging, we here demonstrate the translational value of GT as a multi-level tool, to probe networks at different levels in order to assess treatments, explore mechanisms, and contribute to early diagnosis.

Utilizing Retinotopic Mapping for a Multi-Target SSVEP BCI With a Single Flicker Frequency.	DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2666479	In brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that use the steady-state visual evoked response (SSVEP), the user selects a control command by directing attention overtly or covertly to one out of several flicker stimuli. The different control channels are encoded in the frequency, phase, or time domain of the flicker signals. Here, we present a new type of SSVEP BCI, which uses only a single flicker stimulus and yet affords controlling multiple channels. The approach rests on the observation that the relative position between the stimulus and the foci of overt attention result in distinct topographies of the SSVEP response on the scalp. By classifying these topographies, the computer can determine at which position the user is gazing. Offline data analysis in a study on 12 healthy volunteers revealed that 9 targets can be recognized with about 95±3% accuracy, corresponding to an information transfer rate (ITR) of 40.8 ± 3.3 b/min on average. We explored how the classification accuracy is affected by the number of control channels, the trial length, and the number of EEG channels. Our findings suggest that the EEG data from five channels over parieto-occipital brain areas are sufficient for reliably classifying the topographies and that there is a large potential to improve the ITR by optimizing the trial length. The robust performance and the simple stimulation setup suggest that this approach is a prime candidate for applications on desktop and tablet computers.

Effect of the antidepressant Org 3770 on human sleep.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00278580	The effect of a single dose (30 mg) of Org 3770 (metirzapine) on human sleep was assessed in a double blind, placebo controlled, cross over study in 6 young, healthy male volunteers. The sleep stage classification was based on visual scoring of 24 h electroencephalographic recordings according to the criteria of Rechtschaffen and Kales. Org 3770 30 mg p.o. given 2 h before bedtime had a sleep promoting action in all subjects, resulting in a shortened time to the onset of sleep. Bedtime waking and dozing (Stage 1) were reduced in favour of deep, slow wave sleep (Stages 3 and 4). Org 3770 increased the latency of REM sleep with respect to Stage 2 sleep in all subjects. It also caused a minor reduction in waking periods during REM sleep and a lower frequency of awakenings after periods of movement. No effect of Org 3770 was observed in reaction and vigilance tests on the post treatment day. The observed effects of Org 3770 on normal human sleep suggest that it might ameliorate the sleep disturbances encountered in endogenous depression, which are characterized by a reduction in slow wave sleep, an increase in nighttime awakenings and shortening of REM sleep latency.

The influence of serotonin transporter polymorphisms on cortical activity: a resting EEG study.	DOI: 10.1186/1471-2202-12-33	The serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) is a key regulator of serotonergic neurotransmission and has been linked to various psychiatric disorders. Among the genetic variants, polymorphisms in the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and variable-number-of-tandem-repeat in the second intron (5-HTTVNTR) have functional consequences. However, their genetic impact on cortical oscillation remains unclear. This study examined the modulatory effects of 5-HTTLPR (L-allele carriers vs. non-carriers) and 5-HTTVNTR (10-repeat allele carriers vs. non-carriers) polymorphism on regional neural activity in a young female population.

Is increased D2 receptor availability associated with response to stimulant medication in ADHD.	DOI: 10.1017/s0012162201001384	The purpose of this study was to estimate striatal dopamine (D2) receptor availability in non-drug treated children with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) before and after methylphenidate therapy, and to examine correlations between severity of symptoms and response rates to stimulant medication with levels of striatal D2 receptor binding. Nine children (six males, three females; mean age 9.8 years, SD 2.3 years) with ADHD participated. All underwent iodobenzamide (123I IBZM) brain SPECT within 2 hours following intravenous injection of 123I IBZM before and 3 months after methylphenidate therapy. A semiquantitative approach was used to generate indices of specific D2 receptor binding in the basal ganglia. Specific binding ratios at baseline were higher than the previously reported specific binding values obtained in studies using young healthy adults. D2 availability reduced significantly (paired t-test,p<0.05) as a function of methylphenidate therapy in patients with ADHD in all four regions of the striatum. When the relation between therapy response and D2 availability was investigated, we observed that the higher the baseline D2 levels were, the higher the response rate was (detected as the percentage reduction of hyperactivity scores and Conners Teacher Rating Scale scores), while no such trend was observed between the initial D2 binding levels and the response in attention-deficit scores. Results indicate that in non-drug treated children with ADHD, higher D2 receptor availability is observed at baseline which is down-regulated back to reported near-normal values after methylphenidate therapy. The effect of methylphenidate on D2 receptor levels in patients with ADHD is similar to that observed in healthy adults; a down-regulation phenomenon within 0 to 30%. In addition, initially higher values of D2 availability seem to indicate better response to methylphenidate therapy in ADHD.

Reorganization of the composition of brain oscillations and their temporal characteristics in opioid dependent patients.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.06.005	In the present study, we examined the composition of electroencephalographic (EEG) brain oscillations in broad frequency band (0.5-30 Hz) in 22 opioid-dependent patients and 14 healthy subjects during resting condition (closed eyes). The exact compositions of brain oscillations and their temporal behavior were assessed by the probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns. It was demonstrated that EEG of patients with opioid dependence was characterized by (a) significant reorganization of brain oscillations with increase in the percentage of beta- and mostly fast-alpha-rhythmic segments, (b) longer periods of temporal stabilization for alpha and beta brain oscillations and by shorter periods of temporal stabilization for theta and polyrhythmic activity when compared with control subjects, and (c) right-sided dominance (significantly larger relative presence of particular spectral patterns in EEG channels of the right hemisphere). These effects were widely distributed across the cortex with the maximum magnitude in the occipital, right parietal, temporal, and frontal areas. Taken together the present study suggested (a) an allostatic state with neuronal activation, and (b) high sensitivity of the right hemisphere to adverse opioid effects.

Orexin receptor antagonism: an ascending multiple-dose study with almorexant.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881112448946	The objectives of this study were to investigate the multiple-dose tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the dual orexin receptor antagonist almorexant. Healthy subjects received daily doses of almorexant (100, 200, 400 or 1000 mg) or placebo in the morning for four days followed by two days with evening administration (Days 5-6). Each dose level was investigated in a new group of 10 subjects (eight active, two placebo, 1:1 sex). Dose-dependent increases in frequency and intensity were observed for somnolence and other adverse events. Pharmacokinetics at steady state showed rapid absorption, low concentrations eight hours post-dose, and minimal accumulation. Following evening, administration absorption was delayed and C(max) decreased. Almorexant at 400 and 1000 mg administered in the morning reduced vigilance, alertness, visuomotor coordination, and motor coordination assessed in a psychometric test battery. Polysomnography recordings following evening administration showed a trend towards shorter latency to sleep stages 3 and 4, and shorter latency to, and longer time in, rapid-eye-movement sleep at higher doses when compared to placebo. Whether these findings in healthy subjects translate into relevant sleep-enabling effects in insomnia patients needs to be investigated in future studies.

Changes of somatomotor and parietal regions produced by different amounts of electrical stimulation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.11.063	Our study aims to investigate changes in electrocortical activity by observing the variations in absolute theta power in the primary somatomotor and parietal regions of the brain under three different electrical stimulation conditions: control group (without stimulation), group 24 (24 trials of stimulation) and group 36 (36 trials of stimulation). Thus, our hypothesis is that the application of different patterns of electrical stimulation will promote different states of habituation in these regions. The sample was composed of 24 healthy (absence of mental and physical impairments) students (14 male and 10 female), with ages varying from 25 to 40 years old (32.5+/-7.5), who are right-handed (Edinburgh Inventory). The subjects were randomly distributed into three groups: control (n=8), G24 (n=8) and G36 (n=8). We use the Functional electrical stimulation (FES) equipment (NeuroCompact-2462) to stimulate the right index finger extensor muscle, while the electroencephalographic signal was simultaneously recorded. We found an interaction between condition and block factors for the C3 and P3 electrode, a condition and block main effects for the C4 electrode, and a condition main effect for the P4 electrode. Our results support the hypothesis that electrical stimulation promotes neurophysiological changes. It appears that stimulus adaptation (accommodation) of specific circuits can strengthen the brain's ability to distinguish between and respond to such stimuli over time.

Comparative pharmacodynamic studies with the novel serotonin uptake-enhancing tianeptine and -inhibiting fluvoxamine utilizing EEG mapping and psychometry.	DOI: 10.1007/BF01292627	In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the encephalotropic and psychotropic effects of tianeptine (TIA)--a new tricyclic antidepressant, enhancing serotonin reuptake--were investigated as compared with the serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressant, fluvoxamine (FLU), utilizing EEG mapping, psychometric and psychophysiological measures. 16 healthy volunteers (8 males, 8 females) aged 21-35 (man 27) years received randomized and at weekly intervals single oral doses of placebo, 12.5 and 25 mg TIA and 50 mg FLU. EEG recordings, psychometric and psychophysiological tests and evaluation of pulse, blood pressure and side effects were carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours; blood sampling, in addition, at hour 1. TIA plasma levels rose fast to peaks at 1-2 hours and declined rapidly as well, while the MC5 metabolite peaked in the 4th hour and declined more slowly. EEG mapping demonstrated that both TIA and FLU induced significant changes in brain function between the 1st and 8th hour, which, however, differed in their time course. 12.5 mg TIA exhibited, as compared with placebo, slight activating properties in the EEG (decrease of delta and theta, increase of alpha and beta, acceleration of the centroid), parallelled by thymopsychic improvement (mood elevation). 25 mg TIA showed EEG activation up to the 4th hour, later EEG sedation, accompanied by an initial thymopsychic improvement and differential changes thereafter (improved mood, decreased vigility), with the noopsyche improving at all times (attention, Pauli test). 50 mg FLU induced initially sedation and thereafter activation, accompanied by thymopsychic deterioration and subsequent improvement, the latter also being observed in the noopsyche (attention, memory). In pupillary and skin conductance measures, generally a slight activation occurred after placebo, which was attenuated by 25 mg TIA. Correlation maps between plasma levels and EEG changes demonstrated: the higher the TIA plasma levels, the more absolute and relative beta power, the less alpha power and the faster the centroid of the total power spectrum, reflecting CNS-activation. Topographically, the correlations were mostly seen over both fronto-temporal regions.

The interplay of brain neurotransmission and mental fatigue: A research protocol.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0310271	Mental fatigue (MF) significantly affects both cognitive and physical performance. However, the precise mechanisms, particularly concerning neurotransmission, require further investigation. An implication of the role of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) is stated, but empirical evidence for this theory still needs to be provided. To address this gap, we aim to investigate the role of brain neurotransmission in elucidating if, and how prolonged cognitive activity induces MF and its subsequent impact on cognitive performance.

Cholinergic modulation of motor sequence learning.	DOI: 10.1111/ejn.16374	The cholinergic system plays a key role in motor function, but whether pharmacological modulation of cholinergic activity affects motor sequence learning is unknown. The acetylcholine receptor antagonist biperiden, an established treatment in movement disorders, reduces attentional modulation, but whether it influences motor sequence learning is not clear. Using a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design, we tested 30 healthy young participants and showed that biperiden impairs the ability to learn sequential finger movements, accompanied by widespread oscillatory broadband power changes (4-25 Hz) in the motor sequence learning network after receiving biperiden, with greater power in the theta, alpha and beta bands over ipsilateral motor and bilateral parietal-occipital areas. The reduced early theta power during a repeated compared with random sequence, likely reflecting disengagement of top-down attention to sensory processes, was disrupted by biperiden. Alpha synchronization during repeated sequences reflects sensory gating and lower visuospatial attention requirements compared with visuomotor responses to random sequences. After biperiden, alpha synchronization was greater, potentially reflecting excessive visuospatial attention reduction, affecting visuomotor responding required to enable sequence learning. Beta oscillations facilitate sequence learning by integrating visual and somatosensory inputs, stabilizing repeated sequences and promoting prediction of the next stimulus. The beta synchronization after biperiden fits with a disruption of the selective visuospatial attention enhancement associated with initial sequence learning. These findings highlight the role of cholinergic processes in motor sequence learning.

Interactions of catecholamines and GABA+ in cognitive control: Insights from EEG and 1H-MRS.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2024.120619	Catecholamines and amino acid transmitter systems are known to interact, the exact links and their impact on cognitive control functions have however remained unclear. Using a multi-modal imaging approach combining EEG and proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), we investigated the effect of different degrees of pharmacological catecholaminergic enhancement onto theta band activity (TBA) as a measure of interference control during response inhibition and execution. It was central to our study to evaluate the predictive impact of in-vivo baseline GABA+ concentrations in the striatum, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the supplemental motor area (SMA) of healthy adults under varying degrees of methylphenidate (MPH) stimulation. We provide evidence for a predictive interrelation of baseline GABA+ concentrations in cognitive control relevant brain areas onto task-induced TBA during response control stimulated with MPH. Baseline GABA+ concentrations in the ACC, the striatum, and the SMA had a differential impact on predicting interference control-related TBA in response execution trials. GABA+ concentrations in the ACC appeared to be specifically important for TBA modulations when the cognitive effort needed for interference control was high - that is when no prior task experience exists, or in the absence of catecholaminergic enhancement with MPH. The study highlights the predictive role of baseline GABA+ concentrations in key brain areas influencing cognitive control and responsiveness to catecholaminergic enhancement, particularly in high-effort scenarios.

Exploration of electroencephalogram response to MPH treatment in ADHD patients.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2023.111631	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is known to be associated with several diagnostic resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) patterns, including the theta/beta ratio, but no objective predictive markers for each medication. In this study, we explored EEG markers with which the therapeutic efficacy of medications could be estimated at the 1st clinical visit. Thirty-two ADHD patients and thirty-one healthy subjects participated in this study. EEG was recorded during eyes-closed resting conditions, and ADHD symptoms were scored before and after the therapeutic intervention (8 ± 2 weeks). Although comparing EEG patterns between ADHD patients and healthy subjects showed significant differences, EEG dynamics, e.g., theta/beta ratio, in ADHD patients before and after MPH treatment were not significantly different despite improvements in ADHD symptoms. We demonstrated that MPH good responders and poor responders, defined by the efficacy of MPH, had significantly different theta band power in right temporal areas, alpha in left occipital and frontal areas, and beta in left frontal areas. Moreover, we showed that MPH good responders had significant improvements toward normalization in several coherence measures after MPH treatment. Our study implies the possibility of these EEG indices as predictive markers for ADHD therapeutic efficacy.

Catecholaminergic Modulation of Semantic Processing in Sentence Comprehension.	DOI: 10.1093/cercor/bhaa204	Catecholamine (CA) function has been widely implicated in cognitive functions that are tied to the prefrontal cortex and striatal areas. The present study investigated the effects of methylphenidate, which is a CA agonist, on the electroencephalogram (EEG) response related to semantic processing using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, within-subject design. Forty-eight healthy participants read semantically congruent or incongruent sentences after receiving 20-mg methylphenidate or a placebo while their brain activity was monitored with EEG. To probe whether the catecholaminergic modulation is task-dependent, in one condition participants had to focus on comprehending the sentences, while in the other condition, they only had to attend to the font size of the sentence. The results demonstrate that methylphenidate has a task-dependent effect on semantic processing. Compared to placebo, when semantic processing was task-irrelevant, methylphenidate enhanced the detection of semantic incongruence as indexed by a larger N400 amplitude in the incongruent sentences; when semantic processing was task-relevant, methylphenidate induced a larger N400 amplitude in the semantically congruent condition, which was followed by a larger late positive complex effect. These results suggest that CA-related neurotransmitters influence language processing, possibly through the projections between the prefrontal cortex and the striatum, which contain many CA receptors.

The Modulation of Neural Noise Underlies the Effectiveness of Methylphenidate Treatment in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bpsc.2019.03.011	Various lines of research suggest that the stability of neural processes is low in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Considering overarching neural principles, this lack of stability relates to increased levels of neural noise. However, no study has directly examined neural noise in ADHD. Likewise, it is unknown whether the modulation of neural noise reflects a mechanistic link as to why methylphenidate (MPH) is effective in treating impulsivity in ADHD.

The system-neurophysiological basis for how methylphenidate modulates perceptual-attentional conflicts during auditory processing.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.24344	The ability to selectively perceive and flexibly attend to relevant sensory signals in the environment is essential for action control. Whereas neuromodulation of sensory or attentional processing is often investigated, neuromodulation of interactive effects between perception and attention, that is, high attentional control demand when the relevant sensory information is perceptually less salient than the irrelevant one, is not well understood. To fill this gap, this pharmacological-electroencephalogram (EEG) study applied an intensity-modulated, focused-attention dichotic listening paradigm together with temporal EEG signal decomposition and source localization analyses. We used a double-blind MPH/placebo crossover design to delineate the effects of methylphenidate (MPH)-a dopamine/norepinephrine transporter blocker-on the resolution of perceptual-attentional conflicts, when perceptual saliency and attentional focus favor opposing ears, in healthy young adults. We show that MPH increased behavioral performance specifically in the condition with the most pronounced conflict between perceptual saliency and attentional focus. On the neurophysiological level, MPH effects in line with the behavioral data were observed after accounting for intraindividual variability in the signal. More specifically, MPH did not show an effect on stimulus-related processes but modulated the onset latency of processes between stimulus evaluation and responding. These modulations were further shown to be associated with activation differences in the temporoparietal junction (BA40) and the superior parietal cortex (BA7) and may reflect neuronal gain modulation principles. The findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of modulated dopamine/norepinephrine transmitter systems for the interactions between perception and attention.

Catecholaminergic Modulation of Conflict Control Depends on the Source of Conflicts.

We therefore investigated the functional relevance of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine, which have been shown to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in neuronal processing and should therefore modulate response conflicts.

Electroencephalographic biomarkers as predictors of methylphenidate response in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2018.06.002	EEG biomarkers have shown promise in predicting non-response to stimulant medication in ADHD and could serve as translational biomarkers. This study aimed to replicate and extend previous EEG biomarkers. The international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment for ADHD (iSPOT-A), a multi-center, international, prospective open-label trial, enrolled 336 children and adolescents with ADHD (11.9 yrs; 245 males; prescribed methylphenidate) and 158 healthy children. Treatment response was established after six weeks using the clinician rated ADHD-Rating Scale-IV. Theta/Beta ratio (TBR) and alpha peak frequency (APF) were assessed at baseline as predictors for treatment outcome. No differences between ADHD and controls were found for TBR and APF. 62% of the ADHD group was classified as a responder. Responders did not differ from non-responders in age, medication dosage, and baseline severity of ADHD symptoms. Male-adolescent non-responders exhibited a low frontal APF (Fz: R = 9.2 Hz vs. NR = 8.1 Hz; ES = 0.83), whereas no effects were found for TBR. A low APF in male adolescents was associated with non-response to methylphenidate, replicating earlier work.

Decreased resting gamma activity in adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	DOI: 10.1080/15622975.2018.1441547	Objectives: To delineate task-free gamma activity in adult ADHD and healthy control subjects based on high-density EEG recordings. Relationship of gamma activity with symptom severity was also examined, since gamma activity is considered to be an index of network functions in the brain that underlie higher-order cognitive processes.Methods: Spontaneous EEG was recorded in adult ADHD subjects (N = 42; 25 methylphenidate-naïve and 17 on methylphenidate treatment) and controls (N = 59) with eyes open. EEG absolute power gamma was investigated in the gamma1 (30.25-39 Hz) and gamma2 (39.25-48 Hz) frequency bands.Results: Gamma1 and gamma2 activity was diminished in ADHD compared with healthy control subjects. The difference between ADHD and controls was the most pronounced in the right centroparietal region for both gamma1 and gamma2. Inverse associations were found between gamma1 and gamma2 activity and ADHD symptoms in centroparietal scalp regions.Conclusions: Gamma activity is reduced in adult ADHD, and the reduction has a predominantly right centroparietal distribution. Our findings are consistent with childhood ADHD literature with respect to diminished posterior gamma activity in patients, which may reflect altered dorsal attention network functions. Gamma abnormalities might provide a link between neurophysiological functioning and neuropsychological deficiencies, thereby offering an opportunity to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the clinical symptoms of ADHD.

Brain Networks are Independently Modulated by Donepezil, Sleep, and Sleep Deprivation.	DOI: 10.1007/s10548-017-0608-5	Resting-state connectivity has been widely studied in the healthy and pathological brain. Less well-characterized are the brain networks altered during pharmacological interventions and their possible interaction with vigilance. In the hopes of finding new biomarkers which can be used to identify cortical activity and cognitive processes linked to the effects of drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, the analysis of networks altered by medication would be particularly interesting. Eleven healthy subjects were recruited in the context of the European Innovative Medicines Initiative 'PharmaCog'. Each underwent five sessions of simultaneous EEG-fMRI in order to investigate the effects of donepezil and memantine before and after sleep deprivation (SD). The SD approach has been previously proposed as a model for cognitive impairment in healthy subjects. By applying network based statistics (NBS), we observed altered brain networks significantly linked to donepezil intake and sleep deprivation. Taking into account the sleep stages extracted from the EEG data we revealed that a network linked to sleep is interacting with sleep deprivation but not with medication intake. We successfully extracted the functional resting-state networks modified by donepezil intake, sleep and SD. We observed donepezil induced whole brain connectivity alterations forming a network separated from the changes induced by sleep and SD, a result which shows the utility of this approach to check for the validity of pharmacological resting-state analysis of the tested medications without the need of taking into account the subject specific vigilance.

Inhibition of alpha oscillations through serotonin-2A receptor activation underlies the visual effects of ayahuasca in humans.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2016.03.012	Ayahuasca is an Amazonian psychotropic plant tea typically obtained from two plants, Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis. It contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A and sigma-1 agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) plus β-carboline alkaloids with monoamine-oxidase (MAO)-inhibiting properties. Although the psychoactive effects of ayahuasca have commonly been attributed solely to agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor, the molecular target of classical psychedelics, this has not been tested experimentally. Here we wished to study the contribution of the 5-HT2A receptor to the neurophysiological and psychological effects of ayahuasca in humans. We measured drug-induced changes in spontaneous brain oscillations and subjective effects in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study involving the oral administration of ayahuasca (0.75mg DMT/kg body weight) and the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (40mg). Twelve healthy, experienced psychedelic users (5 females) participated in four experimental sessions in which they received the following drug combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+ayahuasca, ketanserin+placebo and ketanserin+ayahuasca. Ayahuasca induced EEG power decreases in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands. Current density in alpha-band oscillations in parietal and occipital cortex was inversely correlated with the intensity of visual imagery induced by ayahuasca. Pretreatment with ketanserin inhibited neurophysiological modifications, reduced the correlation between alpha and visual effects, and attenuated the intensity of the subjective experience.

Translational neurophysiological markers for activity of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2) modulator JNJ-40411813: Sleep EEG correlates in rodents and healthy men.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2015.11.031	Alterations in rapid eye movement sleep (REM) have been suggested as valid translational efficacy markers: activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) was shown to increase REM latency and to decrease REM duration. The present paper addresses the effects on vigilance states of the mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) JNJ-40411813 at different circadian times in rats and after afternoon dosing in humans. Due to its dual mGluR2 PAM/serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor antagonism in rodents, mGlu2R specificity of effects was studied in wild-type (WT) and mGluR2 (-/-) mice. 5-HT2A receptor occupancy was determined in humans using positron emission tomography (PET). Tolerance development was examined in rats after chronic dosing. EEG oscillations and network connectivity were assessed using multi-channel EEG. In rats, JNJ-40411813 increased deep sleep time and latency of REM onset but reduced REM time when administered 2 h after 'lights on' (CT2): this was sustained after chronic dosing. At CT5 similar effects were elicited, at CT10 only deep sleep was enhanced. Withdrawal resulted in baseline values, while re-administration reinstated drug effects. Parieto-occipital cortical slow theta and gamma oscillations were correlated with low locomotion. The specificity of functional response was confirmed in WT but not mGluR2 (-/-) mice. A double-blind, placebo-controlled polysomnographic study in healthy, elderly subjects showed that 500 mg of JNJ-40411813 consistently increased deep sleep time, but had no effect on REM parameters. This deep sleep effect was not explained by 5-HT2A receptor binding, as in the PET study even 700 mg only marginally displaced the tracer. JNJ-40411813 elicited comparable functional responses in rodents and men if circadian time of dosing was taken into account. These findings underscore the translational potential of sleep mechanisms in evaluating mGluR2 therapeutics when administered at the appropriate circadian time.

Altered cortical causality after remifentanil administration in healthy volunteers: a novel approach for pharmaco-EEG.	DOI: 10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944573	Alterations in cortical causality information flow induced by remifentanil infusion in healthy volunteers was investigated in a placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over study. For each of the 21 enrolled male subjects, 2.5 minutes of resting electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected before and after infusion of remifentanil and placebo. Additionally, to assess cognitive function and analgesic effect, continuous reaction time (CRT) and bone pressure and heat pain were assessed, respectively. The causality information was extracted from the EEG by phase slope index (PSI). Among the features being reproducible between the two baseline recordings, several PSI features were altered by remifentanil administration in comparison to placebo. Furthermore, several of the PSI features altered by remifentanil were correlated to changes in both CRT and pain scores. The results indicate that remifentanil administration influence the information flow between several brain areas. Hence, the EEG causality approach offers the potential to assist in deciphering the cortical effects of remifentanil administration.

Extracting drug mechanism and pharmacodynamic information from clinical electroencephalographic data using generalised semi-linear canonical correlation analysis.	DOI: 10.1088/0967-3334/35/12/2459	Conventional analysis of clinical resting electroencephalography (EEG) recordings typically involves assessment of spectral power in pre-defined frequency bands at specific electrodes. EEG is a potentially useful technique in drug development for measuring the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of a centrally acting compound and hence to assess the likelihood of success of a novel drug based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) principles. However, the need to define the electrodes and spectral bands to be analysed a priori is limiting where the nature of the drug-induced EEG effects is initially not known. We describe the extension to human EEG data of a generalised semi-linear canonical correlation analysis (GSLCCA), developed for small animal data. GSLCCA uses data from the whole spectrum, the entire recording duration and multiple electrodes. It provides interpretable information on the mechanism of drug action and a PD measure suitable for use in PK-PD modelling. Data from a study with low (analgesic) doses of the μ-opioid agonist, remifentanil, in 12 healthy subjects were analysed using conventional spectral edge analysis and GSLCCA. At this low dose, the conventional analysis was unsuccessful but plausible results consistent with previous observations were obtained using GSLCCA, confirming that GSLCCA can be successfully applied to clinical EEG data.

Altered frequency distribution in the electroencephalogram is correlated to the analgesic effect of remifentanil.	DOI: 10.1111/bcpt.12330	Opioids alter resting state brain oscillations by multiple and complex factors, which are still to be elucidated. To increase our knowledge, multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was subjected to multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), to identify the most descriptive frequency bands and scalp locations altered by remifentanil in healthy volunteers. Sixty-two channels of resting EEG followed by independent measures of pain scores to heat and bone pain were recorded in 21 healthy males before and during remifentanil infusion in a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. EEG frequency distributions were extracted by a continuous wavelet transform and normalized into delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. Alterations relative to pre-treatment responses were calculated for all channels and used as input to the MVPA. Compared to placebo, remifentanil increased the delta band and decreased the theta and alpha band oscillations as a mean over all channels (all p ≤ 0.007). The most discriminative channels in these frequency bands were F1 in delta (83.33%, p = 0.0023) and theta bands (95.24%, p < 0.0001), and C6 in the alpha band (80.95%, p = 0.0054). These alterations were correlated to individual changes in heat pain in the delta (p = 0.045), theta (p = 0.038) and alpha (p = 0.039) bands and to bone pain in the alpha band (p = 0.0092). Hence, MVPA of multi-channel EEG was able to identify frequency bands and corresponding channels most sensitive to altered brain activity during remifentanil treatment. As the EEG alterations were correlated to the analgesic effect, the approach may prove to be a novel methodology for monitoring individual efficacy to opioids.

Network dynamics predict improvement in working memory performance following donepezil administration in healthy young adults.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.11.020	Attentional selection in the context of goal-directed behavior involves top-down modulation to enhance the contrast between relevant and irrelevant stimuli via enhancement and suppression of sensory cortical activity. Acetylcholine (ACh) is believed to be involved mechanistically in such attention processes. The objective of the current study was to examine the effects of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic levels of ACh, on the relationship between performance and network dynamics during a visual working memory (WM) task involving relevant and irrelevant stimuli. Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was recorded in 14 healthy young adults while they performed a selective face/scene working memory task. Each participant received either placebo or donepezil (5mg, orally) on two different visits in a double-blinded study. To investigate the effects of donepezil on brain network dynamics we utilized a novel EEG-based Brain Network Activation (BNA) analysis method that isolates location-time-frequency interrelations among event-related potential (ERP) peaks and extracts condition-specific networks. The activation level of the network modulated by donepezil, reflected in terms of the degree of its dynamical organization, was positively correlated with WM performance. Further analyses revealed that the frontal-posterior theta-alpha sub-network comprised the critical regions whose activation level correlated with beneficial effects on cognitive performance. These results indicate that condition-specific EEG network analysis could potentially serve to predict beneficial effects of therapeutic treatment in working memory.

Effects of remifentanil on processing of auditory stimuli: a combined MEG/EEG study.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881113512036	Remifentanil (Ultiva(®)) is a potent ultra-short acting mu-opioid receptor agonist used for perioperative pain treatment and anaesthesia. So far, it is not known how sensitive the cognitive processing of auditory perception elicited by the mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm is to opioids. The present exploratory study investigated how the opioid remifentanil modulates different stages of auditory processing as reflected in the MMN(m) and P3a(m). We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during auditory stimulation under remifentanil or placebo infusion in 20 healthy participants. For the MMN, a gender effect was found for tones deviating in frequency (± 10%) from the standard tone. Remifentanil increased the amplitude of the frequency MMN at F3 in females but not in males. No effect of treatment was found for the MMN(m) or the novel P3a(m). These results suggest that while the bottom-up stimulus change detection system for auditory stimuli appears to be relatively insensitive to opioids, the automatic attention switch caused by the change detection seems to be modulated by the opioid system in females. The multiple deviant paradigm including novel sounds is a promising tool for investigating pharmacological manipulation of different stages of auditory processing. Furthermore, combining the two techniques will yield more specific information about the drug effects on MMN(m).

Activation of serotonin 2A receptors underlies the psilocybin-induced effects on α oscillations, N170 visual-evoked potentials, and visual hallucinations.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3007-12.2013	Visual illusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of serotonergic hallucinogen-induced altered states of consciousness. Although the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin activates multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptors, recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT2A receptors may lead to the formation of visual hallucinations by increasing cortical excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of psilocybin (215 μg/kg vs placebo) on both α oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early visual-evoked P1 and N170 potentials in healthy human subjects. To further disentangle the specific contributions of 5-HT2A receptors, subjects were additionally pretreated with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (50 mg vs placebo). We found that psilocybin strongly decreased prestimulus parieto-occipital α power values, thus precluding a subsequent stimulus-induced α power decrease. Furthermore, psilocybin strongly decreased N170 potentials associated with the appearance of visual perceptual alterations, including visual hallucinations. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, indicating that activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psilocybin profoundly modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenological indices of visual processing. Specifically, activation of 5-HT2A receptors may induce a processing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is overwhelmed by spontaneous neuronal excitation through the modulation of α oscillations. Furthermore, the observed reduction of N170 visual-evoked potentials may be a key mechanism underlying 5-HT2A receptor-mediated visual hallucinations. This change in N170 potentials may be important not only for psilocybin-induced states but also for understanding acute hallucinatory states seen in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

Methylphenidate (MPH) promotes visual cortical activation in healthy adults in a cued visuomotor task.	DOI: 10.1007/s00702-012-0799-6	Seeking for the mechanisms by which methylphenidate (MPH) improves behavior has demonstrated that MPH modulates excitability in the primary motor cortex. However, little is known about the influence of MPH on top-down controlled mechanisms in the sensory domain. The present study explored the effects of MPH on the activation of visual cortices in healthy adults who performed a cued visuo-motor task in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Two distinct measures, posterior alpha power and occipital slow cortical potentials (SCPs), were used to reflect raise in excitability and attention-based activation of visual cortical areas. According to the results, performance parameters (reaction time, response variance and error rate) were not affected by MPH. At the neurophysiologic level reflected by reduced alpha power, MPH increased the overall excitability of the occipital cortex, but not the parietal cortex. Before the cued response, MPH reduced alpha power and increased SCPs only before right hand responses, mostly at the right occipital location. It can be concluded that in visuo-motor tasks, MPH has the potency of adjusting the background excitation/inhibition balance of visual areas. Additionally, MPH may raise the attention controlled activation of visual cortical regions, especially during increased response control.

Human electrophysiological correlates of learned irrelevance: effects of the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden.	DOI: 10.1017/S1461145711001647	Learned irrelevance (LIrr) refers to a reduction in associative learning after pre-exposure of the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus in a non-contingent fashion. This paradigm might serve as a translational model for (pre)attentive information processing deficits in schizophrenia. This is the first study to investigate the event-related potentials (ERPs) of a within-subject LIrr paradigm in humans. Furthermore, the effects of the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden on LIrr were assessed. As expected, LIrr was found to be intact in young healthy volunteers after placebo. Furthermore, in the placebo condition P3b latency was decreased for target stimuli, which were pre-cued. This suggests that the predictability of the occurrence of these stimuli is mainly reflected by this ERP component. Biperiden had no effect on the behavioural LIrr measures, although prolonged reaction times were evident. Biperiden increased the N1 amplitude of the pre-exposed predictor letters, suggesting an effect of this drug on early perceptual processing. In conclusion, the within-subject paradigm used in the current study in combination with electroencephalography can reveal brain mechanisms involved in LIrr. M1 antagonism did not affect LIrr performance but seemed to influence early information processing.

Pharmacokinetics and central nervous system effects of the novel dopamine D2 receptor antagonist JNJ-37822681.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881111415733	Using the rate of dissociation from the D(2) receptor as a means to screen novel compounds for antipsychotic drug candidates, the centrally acting and fast-dissociating selective dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist JNJ-37822681 was developed. In a blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized first-in-human study, JNJ-37822681 was administered orally to 27 healthy male volunteers at doses of 0.5, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg. Safety, pharmacokinetics and central nervous system effects were evaluated by measuring prolactin levels, eye movements, adaptive tracking, visual analogue scales, body sway, finger tapping and electroencephalography. JNJ-37822681 was well tolerated and somnolence was the most frequently reported adverse effect. Peak plasma concentrations increased more than proportional to dose, but increases in the area under curve (AUC) were dose-proportional. Prolactin elevations started at doses of 5 mg, whereas small decreases in adaptive tracking were demonstrated at 10 mg doses. At higher doses, JNJ-37822681 caused a small decrease in saccadic peak velocity, smooth pursuit, alertness, finger tapping and electroencephalography activity, and an increase in body sway. This effect profile is likely to be the result of the selectivity of JNJ-37822681 for the D(2) receptor, leading to strong D(2) receptor-mediated elevations in serum prolactin, but fewer effects on more complex central nervous system functions, which are likely to involve multiple neurotransmitters.

Interplay of neuronal processes during response inhibition: results from a combined event-related potentials (ERPs)/transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study on methylphenidate.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2011.05.004	The neuronal processes underlying response inhibition are often studied using either event-related potentials (ERPs) or by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate excitatory and inhibitory processes in the motor system. We performed a more refined analysis of response inhibition by combining both approaches with the aim of identifying an interplay between ERPs and TMS parameters. During a go/nogo task, motor system excitability was measured using TMS single and double pulses and brain electrical activity was recorded in healthy adults (n=14). Each participant completed two testing sessions, once on placebo and once on methylphenidate (double-blind, crossover design). Studying the effects of methylphenidate served as an example application for this combined approach. Developing regression models, inhibition-related TMS measures (e.g., short intracortical inhibition) and the contingent negative variation explained about 85% of the variance of the nogo-P3 under both MPH and placebo medication. The smaller the inhibitory effect in the motor system, the more terminal response control was required and the more resources were allocated for the evaluation of the inhibitory process, respectively, as indicated by a larger P3. Thus, an interplay between processes in the motor system (cortex) and control processes with sources in the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) may take place, acting complementarily to facilitate a correct nogo-response. While ERPs rather represent initiation and monitoring of inhibitory processes and response control, motor inhibition may be best analyzed using TMS. A combined ERP/TMS analysis may allow for the development of distinct models concerning the interplay of processes involved in response inhibition.

ERP effects of methylphenidate and working memory load in healthy adults during a serial visual working memory task.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2010.07.030	The objective of the study was to investigate neuronal processing during the encoding, retention and retrieval phases of a serial visual working memory task. Particularly, we were interested in how these phases are affected by working memory load and how processing is modulated by methylphenidate. Healthy adults were asked to memorize the order of four, five or six pictures under methylphenidate (20mg) and under placebo while brain electrical activity was recorded. On the performance level, the number of correct responses decreased with increasing working memory load. Concerning brain electrical activity, in the encoding phase P3 amplitudes increased at midline electrodes with increasing memory load while load had no effect in the retention and retrieval phase. Medication neither influenced performance nor the different processing stages significantly. Our data provide evidence that during the encoding phase more attentional resources are allocated in trials with higher load as reflected by larger P3 amplitudes.

Methylphenidate improves deficient error evaluation in children with ADHD: an event-related brain potential study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2007.08.004	Children with ADHD make more errors than control children in response-conflict tasks. To explore whether this is mediated by enhanced sensitivity to conflict or reduced error-processing, task-related brain activity (N2, Ne/ERN, Pe) was compared between 8- to 12-year-old children with ADHD and healthy controls during performance of a flanker task. Furthermore, effects of methylphenidate were investigated in ADHD children in a second study. ADHD children made more errors, especially in high-response-conflict conditions, without showing post-error slowing. N2 amplitudes were enhanced on trials resulting in an error response, Ne/ERN amplitude was unaffected and Pe amplitude was reduced in the ADHD group. Methylphenidate reduced errors in both low- and high-conflict conditions and normalized Pe amplitudes in children with ADHD. It was concluded that the inaccurate behaviour of ADHD children in conflict tasks might be related to reduced error-awareness and higher sensitivity to response conflict. Methylphenidate's ameliorating effects might be established through its influence on brain networks including posterior (parietal) cortex, enabling children with ADHD to allocate more attention to significant events.

Effects of antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs on action monitoring in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.01.006	Humans need to monitor their actions continuously to detect errors as fast as possible and to adjust their performance to prevent future errors. This process of action monitoring can be investigated by measuring the error-related negativity (ERN), an ERP component elicited immediately after an error. In the current study, we investigated action monitoring after administration of the classic antipsychotic haloperidol (2.5 mg), the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (10 mg), and the antidepressant paroxetine (20 mg), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Healthy volunteers (N = 14) were administered the three compounds and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, single-dose, four-way cross-over design. All participants performed a speeded two-choice reaction task, while event-related potentials and behavioral measurements were obtained. Both haloperidol and olanzapine significantly reduced ERN amplitudes. After paroxetine, the ERN was not different from placebo. N2 congruency effects were not affected by treatment condition. Only olanzapine demonstrated behavioral effects, namely a slowing of responses, an increase in error rates, and the absence of performance adjustments. The attenuated ERNs after the dopamine antagonist haloperidol are in line with the presumed role of dopamine in action monitoring. Haloperidol is thought to block dopaminergic signaling, thus reducing ERN amplitudes. On the other hand, the effects of olanzapine are mainly caused by its sedative side effects, leading to a decline in motivation and appraisal of errors. Finally, the absence of any effects after paroxetine suggests that serotonin transmission does not play a direct role in regulating mechanisms related to action monitoring.

A combined neurophysiological and behavioural study into the stimulating effects of fexofenadine on performance.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881105058362	Antihistamines are known for their sedative effects. However, some studies suggested mild stimulant effects in the case of fexofenadine. The goals of this study are to examine whether fexofenadine possesses stimulating properties and to determine whether such stimulating effects are related to workload. Sixteen healthy volunteers received a single dose of 180 and 360 mg fexofenadine and placebo on separate test days. Drug effects were assessed using a divided attention task (DAT), continuous performance task (CPT) and motor choice reaction time test (MCRT). Sensitivity of the tasks was increased by manipulating the workload during task performance. Event Related brain Potentials (ERPs) were measured in the DAT and CPT to study the underlying neurophysiological processes. An interaction effect of Treatment and Workload was found on tracking performance in the DAT and on movement time in the MCRT. Performance on the DAT was less affected by increments in workload after fexofenadine as compared to placebo. P1 and P3 latency were affected by Treatment x Workload and Treatment respectively and indicated faster attentional and information processing latencies following fexofenadine treatment. Treatment did not influence performance in the CPT task or in the ERPs measured during this task. The MCRT demonstrated faster movement times following fexofenadine treatment. These results suggest that although the neurophysiological data indicate central nervous system (CNS) activation after fexofenadine treatment, the magnitude of the centrally activating effects is too small to produce relevant performance improvement at the behavioural level.

The effects of cricoid pressure, remifentanil, and propofol on esophageal motility and the lower esophageal sphincter.	DOI: 10.1213/01.ANE.0000147508.31879.38	Cricoid pressure is the gold standard during the induction of anesthesia when there is a risk of aspiration of gastric contents. However, the effect of cricoid pressure during the different steps of complete anesthesia induction has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cricoid pressure, remifentanil, and propofol on lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and esophageal motility. We recorded LES pressure (LESP) and calculated barrier pressure ([BrP] = LESP - gastric pressure) in 10 healthy volunteers using a Dent sleeve device. There was a significant decrease in LESP and BrP when a cricoid pressure of 30 N was performed in the awake volunteers (P < 0.05). However, this effect was not seen during the infusion of remifentanil 0.2 microg . kg(-1) . min(-1). Remifentanil per se or together with a bolus dose of propofol 1 mg/kg IV did not induce any statistical change in LESP or BrP. Remifentanil abolished spontaneous esophageal motility and completely eliminated the experience of discomfort induced by cricoid pressure. In conclusion, cricoid pressure of 30 N induced a decrease of LESP and BrP in awake volunteers. These effects were not seen during the remifentanil infusion. This shows the importance of when to apply cricoid pressure during rapid-sequence induction.

Measuring depth of sedation with auditory evoked potentials during controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1213/01.ANE.0000135634.46493.0A	Avoiding excessively deep levels of sedation is a major problem in intensive care patients. We studied whether clinically relevant levels of sedation can be objectively assessed using long latency auditory evoked potentials. We measured the auditory evoked potentials at 100 ms after the stimulus (N100) in 10 healthy volunteers during stepwise increasing, clinically relevant levels of sedation (Ramsay score [RS] 2-4). The volunteers were studied on three separate occasions and received an infusion of either propofol or a combination of propofol and remifentanil. Effects of remifentanil infusion alone were tested during target controlled infusion (target plasma concentrations: 1, 2, and 3 ng/mL). Remifentanil did not affect evoked potential amplitudes and latencies. During both propofol-induced and propofol/remifentanil-induced sedation, the N100 amplitude decreased similarly without an effect on the latencies as the level of sedation increased from Ramsay score 2 to Ramsay score 4 (P < 0.01). At the same clinical level of sedation, propofol plasma concentrations were larger when sedation was achieved by propofol alone (propofol versus propofol/remifentanil, RS 3: 2.12 mug/mL +/- 0.51 versus 1.32 +/- 0.43, P < 0.01; RS 4: 3.37 +/- 0.47 versus 1.86 +/- 0.34, P < 0.01).

Electrophysiological investigation of the effectiveness of methylphenidate in children with and without ADHD.	DOI: 10.1007/s00702-003-0818-8	The Continuous Performance Test (CPT) is an appropriate instrument for assessment of correlates at the brain electrical activity level of attention and response to stimulant medication. The aim of the study was to confirm at the electrophysiological level the clinical effectiveness of methylphenidate (MPH) in children with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); to this end, a comparative study of hyperactive and healthy control children was undertaken, employing a modified CPT test. Twenty-one channel ERPs from 17 hyperactive boys, with and without MPH treatment, and from 20 healthy control children were analyzed with reference-independent techniques. The resulting quasi-stabile microstates correspond to the time ranges of the conventional ERP components P100, P200 and P300 (with the subcomponents P3a and P3b) and could be discriminated by means of data-based segmentation. The P3a amplitudes of the hyperactive children, in each case with and without MPH medication, were compared with those of healthy controls. P3a segment amplitudes were significantly lower in non-medicated ADHD patients than in healthy children, both following positive and inhibitory stimulus conditions. A significant medication effect was detected following MPH treatment: segment 3 amplitudes in MPH-treated hyperactive children were not significantly different from those of healthy controls.

"Correlation of approximate entropy, bispectral index, and spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95) with clinical signs of ""anesthetic depth"" during coadministration of propofol and remifentanil."	DOI: 10.1097/00000542-200303000-00008	Several studies relating electroencephalogram parameter values to clinical endpoints using a single (mostly hypnotic) drug at relatively low levels of central nervous system depression (sedation) have been published. However, the usefulness of a parameter derived from the electroencephalogram for clinical anesthesia largely depends on its ability to predict the response to stimuli of different intensity or painfulness under a combination of a hypnotic and an (opioid) analgesic. This study was designed to evaluate the predictive performance of spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), BIS, and approximate entropy for the response to increasingly intense stimuli under different concentrations of both propofol and remifentanil in the therapeutic range.

Effects on sleep architecture of pindolol, paroxetine and their combination in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1007/s00213-002-1314-9	The combination of pindolol with a serotonergic antidepressant has been used to speed up the antidepressant response and to augment in cases of resistant depression. Animal studies have suggested that this increased response occurs because of 5HT(1A) antagonist properties of pindolol, which in combination with a serotonergic antidepressant produces a synergistic increase in 5HT in the synapse.

EEG correlates of acute and chronic paroxetine treatment in depression.	DOI: 10.1016/s0165-0327(01)00308-1	Single dose administration of efficacious antidepressant agents elicit characteristic pharmaco-electroencephalographic (EEG) profiles in healthy volunteers but acute and chronic pharmaco-EEG profiling of antidepressant action in depressed patients has been relatively lacking. This study sought to examine the quantitative topographic EEGs of depressed patients in response to paroxetine treatment. Thirty male patients, meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression, were examined before and after a single 20 mg dose. These, and an additional 40 patients, were also assessed following 6 weeks of treatment. Eyes-closed resting EEG, collected from 21 scalp sites, was spectrally analyzed to yield regional measures of absolute/relative power and mean frequency in delta, theta, alpha, beta and total spectrum frequency bands. Chronic treatment resulted in a significant reduction in scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), with 80% of treatment completers exhibiting a >50% reduction in depression ratings at the end of the 6th week. Acute paroxetine did not alter EEG in patients but chronic treatment was associated with significant alterations as shown by diffuse decreases in alpha power and increases in slow (delta and theta) and anterior fast (beta) wave power, Mean theta and alpha (occipital) frequency were slowed while mean total frequency was accelerated at frontal sites and decreased at occipital sites. The chronic pharmaco-EEG response pattern reflects both sedating and activating actions in regional specific areas which are relevant to the pathophysiology and the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of depression.

Remifentanil dose/electroencephalogram bispectral response during combined propofol/regional anesthesia.	DOI: 10.1097/00000539-200206000-00028	The effect of opioid administration on the bispectral index (BIS) during general anesthesia is controversial. Several investigators have reported BIS to be insensitive to opioid addition, whereas others have found a hypnotic response. We designed this study to examine the effect of remifentanil on BIS during combined regional/general propofol anesthesia under steady-state conditions. After Human Investigations Committee approval, 19 healthy ASA physical status I or II patients were enrolled in a prospective experimental design. Regional anesthesia was initiated and general anesthesia induced by using computer-assisted continuous infusion of propofol. Propofol was incrementally adjusted to a BIS of approximately 60. After 20 min at a stable propofol infusion rate, a remifentanil computer-assisted continuous infusion (effect-site target concentration of 0.5, 2.5, and then 10 ng/mL) was sequentially administered at stepped 15-min intervals. BIS decreased from 56 +/- 2 to 44 +/- 1, 95% spectral edge frequency from 17.9 +/- 0.5 Hz to 15.0 +/- 0.4 Hz, heart rate from 84 +/- 5 bpm to 62 +/- 4 bpm, and mean arterial blood pressure from 93 +/- 4 mm Hg to 69 +/- 3 mm Hg with increasing remifentanil concentration. A significant linear correlation between BIS, 95% spectral edge frequency, heart rate, and log (remifentanil effect-site) concentration was found. The change in baseline BIS was relatively modest but significant, suggesting that remifentanil has some sedative/hypnotic properties, or that it potentiates the hypnotic effect of propofol.

Effects of the selective activation of 5-HT3 receptors on sleep: a polysomnographic study in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/s0924-977x(01)00099-2	The respective role of various classes of central serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness cycles has been the subject of many studies. Notably, it has been reported that 5-HT1A/B receptors are involved in the regulation of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and that 5-HT2A/C receptors participate in the control of slow wave sleep (SWS), but the role of 5-HT3 receptors is less well characterised. In this study we investigated the effects of SR 57227A, a potent and selective 5-HT3 agonist, on the sleep EEG of normal young male volunteers. SR 57227A (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 mg o.d. and 20 mg b.i.d.) or placebo were administered during 7 consecutive days in seven groups of ten subjects using a parallel group design. Sleep EEG recordings were performed on days 6 and 7 after an habituation session. SR 57227A produced a dose-dependent shift of REMS toward the end of the night without changing REMS and SWS duration nor altering sleep continuity. It suggests a role for the 5-HT3 receptor in the human sleep-wakefulness cycle and particularly in REMS regulation.

Quantitative EEG changes associated with loss and return of consciousness in healthy adult volunteers anaesthetized with propofol or sevoflurane.	DOI: 10.1093/bja/87.3.421	Significant changes in topographic quantitative EEG (QEEG) features were documented during induction and emergence from anaesthesia induced by the systematic administration of sevoflurane and propofol in combination with remifentanil. The goal was to identify those changes that were sensitive to alterations in the state of consciousness but independent of anaesthetic protocol. Healthy paid volunteers were anaesthetized and reawakened using propofol/remifentanil and sevoflurane/remifentanil, administered in graded steps while the level of arousal was measured. Alterations in the level of arousal were accompanied by significant QEEG changes, many of which were consistent across anaesthetic protocols. Light sedation was accompanied by decreased posterior alpha and increased frontal/central beta power. Frontal power predominance increased with deeper sedation, involving alpha and, to a lesser extent, delta and theta power. With loss of consciousness, delta and theta power increased further in anterior regions and also spread to posterior regions. These changes reversed with return to consciousness.

The effect of remifentanil on the heat pain threshold in volunteers.	DOI: 10.1097/00000539-200102000-00017	Remifentanil offers a wide range of clinical uses and has been successfully combined with general anesthetics. However, there are few human experimental studies demonstrating the analgesic property of remifentanil. It was our aim to determine the analgesic effect of remifentanil with regard to dose-dependent increments in a human model of heat pain threshold assessment. Twenty healthy volunteers were randomized in a double-blinded cross-over design to receive an infusion of remifentanil or saline. The stepped infusion was increased every 5 min by 0.01 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) up to 0.17 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)and terminated in case of defined safety limits. Thermal sensory testing of the heat pain threshold was performed every 5 min at the left forearm. The dose-response relationship and the effective dose for at least 50% of the subjects (ED(50)) were determined. Remifentanil led to a clear dose-dependent increase of the heat pain threshold differing significantly from placebo (P < 0.0007). The ED(50) of remifentanil equals 0.05 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) (first quartile 0.025 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) and third quartile 0.06 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)) in this experimental setting. In conclusion, an opioid-mediated analgesic effect of remifentanil was determined in a human heat pain threshold model. The dose of 0.05 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) is an effective and safe increment in healthy volunteers.

Bisulfite-containing propofol: is it a cost-effective alternative to Diprivan for induction of anesthesia?	DOI: 10.1097/00000539-200010000-00019	Propofol (Diprivan(TM); AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) is a commonly used drug for the induction of general anesthesia in the ambulatory setting. With the availability of a new bisulfite-containing generic formulation of propofol, questions have arisen regarding its cost effectiveness and safety compared with Diprivan(TM). Two hundred healthy outpatients were randomly assigned, according to a double-blinded protocol, to receive either Diprivan(TM) or bisulfite-containing propofol 1.5 mg/kg IV as part of a standardized induction sequence. Maintenance of anesthesia consisted of either desflurane (4%-8% end-tidal) or sevoflurane (1%-2% end-tidal) in combination with a remifentanil infusion (0.125 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) IV). Patient assessments included pain on injection, induction time, hemodynamic and bispectral electroencephalographic changes during induction, emergence time, and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. The two propofol groups were comparable demographically, and the induction times and bispectral index values during the induction were also similar. However, the bisulfite-containing formulation was associated with less severe pain on injection (5% vs 11%), with fewer patients recalling pain on injection after surgery (38% vs. 51%, P<0.05). None of the patients manifested allergic-type reactions after the induction of anesthesia. The acquisition cost (average wholesale price in US dollars) of a 20-mL ampoule of Diprivan(TM) was $15 compared with $13 for the bisulfite-containing propofol formulation. Therefore, we concluded that the bisulfite-containing formulation of propofol is a cost-effective alternative to Diprivan(TM) for the induction of outpatient anesthesia.

Effects of subchronic paroxetine administration on night-time endocrinological profiles in healthy male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/s0306-4530(99)00065-7	To evaluate the subchronic effects of paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on nocturnal endocrinological profiles, eight healthy male volunteers with no personal or family history of a psychiatric or neurological disease were administered paroxetine (30 mg/day) or placebo in a double-blind cross-over design. Drugs were given as a single dose at 10:00 h for a period of 4 weeks each. Between days 21 and 28 of each treatment period, sleep EEG was registered for four consecutive nights from 23:00 to 07:00 h. During the last night, hormonal profiles for prolactin, growth hormone (GH), cortisol, corticotropin (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone and melatonin were determined, and area-under-the-curve values were calculated. None of the endocrinological parameters revealed any statistically significant changes. A trend could be found for an increased cortisol production under paroxetine (P = 0.069). ACTH, LH, and melatonin showed slight and non-significant decreases. Prolactin release was only marginally elevated (+7%). The mean sleep onset GH release (as measured for a time period of 180 min after sleep onset) was decreased by about 30% under paroxetine. However, statistical significance could not be reached. For hGH, there was a delayed mean GH-peak under paroxetine. Nocturnal testosterone secretion remained almost unaltered. The lack of significant endocrinological alterations might be partially explained by both adaptational phenomena under subchronic treatment conditions and the extended time span between the single morning dose and the registration period, respectively.

Conventional and spectral power analysis of all-night sleep EEG after subchronic treatment with paroxetine in healthy male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/s0924-977x(97)00080-1	Paroxetine is a selective and potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor with reported antidepressant properties. Since changes in the regular sleeping pattern were described as side effects under treatment with paroxetine, the impact of the drug on the sleep architecture is of major interest. The present study addressed the question of subchronic effects of paroxetine medication (30 mg/day) in eight healthy male volunteers in a double blind, placebo-controlled crossover-design. Conventional sleep EEG parameters and additionally computed spectral power analysis based on FFT of 20-s time epochs in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency range for different sleep stages after 4 weeks of treatment were investigated. Subchronic paroxetine administration in healthy subjects led to a prolonged REM latency and a decrease in the number of REM phases, whereas sleep efficiency, total sleep time, sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, and awake during sleep period time were not altered by paroxetine medication. Moreover, we could not detect any alterations of the spectral power values in certain frequency bands during NREM or REM sleep following subchronic paroxetine medication.

Analysis of sleep EEG microstructure in subchronic paroxetine treatment of healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1007/s002130050318	Paroxetine is a selective and potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor and its efficacy for the treatment of depression has been proven. Under acute and subchronical treatment regimens, disturbances of the regular sleep pattern are a reported side effect of the drug. The present study was therefore performed to investigate the impact of subchronic treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine on the microstructure of the sleep EEG. The study especially addressed the question of subchronic effects of paroxetine medication (30 mg/day) in eight healthy male volunteers in a double blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Conventional sleep EEG parameters and a spectral power analysis for different sleep stages after 4 weeks of treatment were computed. Additionally, the correlation of certain EEG rhythms across the night was calculated in order to detect subtle dynamical EEG alterations, not necessarily obvious when regarding conventional EEG analysis. Although we could not detect any alterations of the spectral power values in certain frequency bands either during NREM nor during REM sleep following subchronic paroxetine medication, the dynamical EEG attributes across the night revealed a significant enhancement of the correlation between certain EEG rhythms mainly during NREM sleep.

A quantitative evaluation of the relationships between growth hormone secretion and delta wave electroencephalographic activity during normal sleep and after enrichment in delta waves.	DOI: 10.1093/sleep/19.10.817	The existence of a relationship between growth hormone (GH) release and slow-wave sleep (SWS), often studied in the past using conventional scoring of sleep stages, remains controversial. In the present study, this relationship was reevaluated by spectral analysis of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and deconvolution analysis of the plasma GH concentrations during normal nocturnal sleep and after enrichment in SWS by means of ritanserin, a selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. Eight healthy male subjects each participated in two randomized night studies after having received either a placebo or a 5-mg dose of ritanserin. They were subjected to 8 hours of polysomnography, including spectral analysis of the sleep EEG. Plasma GH levels were measured at 10-minute intervals. The mean delta absolute power and the mean GH secretory rates were significantly higher under ritanserin than under placebo for the first 3 hours after sleep onset (+24% and +29%, respectively). Their nocturnal profiles were significantly and positively correlated in all subjects (average r = 0.710 under placebo, 0.567 under ritanserin; p < 0.0001 in both cases). GH secretory pulses were found to be coincident with delta activity peaks in both directions. The amount of GH secreted during significant GH pulses was correlated with the amount of concomitant delta wave activity (r = 0.803 under placebo, r = 0.764 under ritanserin, p < 0.0001). Similarly, the amount of delta wave activity found during delta wave peaks was correlated with the amount of GH secreted concomitantly (r = 0.715 under placebo, r = 0.723 under ritanserin: p < 0.0001). These results demonstrate a close temporal and quantitative relationship between GH secretion and delta wave activity, which may be evidence of common stimulatory mechanisms.

Grapefruit juice alters the systemic bioavailability and cardiac repolarization of terfenadine in poor metabolizers of terfenadine.	DOI: 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1996.tb04210.x	A prospective cohort study was conducted to examine the effects of double-strength grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics and electrocardiographic repolarization pharmacodynamics of terfenadine in poor metabolizers of terfenadine. Six healthy volunteers who were previously found to be poor metabolizers of terfenadine were studied, with each participant serving as his or her own control. In phase I of the study, terfenadine was given to participants at recommended dosages until steady state was achieved (60 mg twice daily for 7 days). In phase II, participants began receiving concomitant twice-daily, double-strength servings of grapefruit juice for 7 days. Serial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic determinations were made after each phase of the study. The main outcome measures were serum concentrations of terfenadine and terfenadine acid metabolite, and corrected QT intervals as determined by 12-lead electrocardiogram. Significant changes occurred in time to maximum concentration (t(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of terfenadine and terfenadine acid metabolite after addition of grapefruit juice. All participants had detectable concentrations of unmetabolized terfenadine at the end of Phase I, which were quantified in three of the six participants. Further, all participants had increased and quantifiable levels of unmetabolized terfenadine after addition of grapefruit juice that were associated with prolongation of the QT interval relative to the baseline control period without terfenadine. Grapefruit juice did not alter the elimination half-life (t1/2) of terfenadine acid metabolite. Because of the intraindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine, further study is needed to confirm these results.

Temporal link between plasma thyrotropin levels and electroencephalographic activity in man.	DOI: 10.1016/0304-3940(95)12082-f	Plasma thyrotropin (TSH) levels have been previously shown to be associated with the internal sleep structure determined by conventional scoring of sleep stages. This temporal relationship was re-evaluated using spectral analysis of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG). Eight healthy male subjects underwent two randomized night studies after having received either placebo or 5 mg ritanserin, a selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist known to increase slow-wave sleep. Delta relative power and TSH levels, determined at 10 min intervals, were found to be inversely related with an average cross-correlation coefficient highly significant (P < 0.0001) in both experimental conditions. Alpha slow-wave index, an estimator of awakenings, and TSH pulses exhibited a significant temporal association in both conditions. These results demonstrate that TSH fluctuations are linked to the sleep EEG activity in man.

Pharmacologically induced changes in arousal: effects on behavioral and electrophysiologic measures of alertness and attention.	DOI: 10.1016/0013-4694(95)00124-h	The relationships between the diffuse subcortical neurotransmitter systems and behavioral and physiologic measures of alertness and attention are not well understood. This study was designed to further understand these relationships. In this double-blind experiment, 23 subjects ingested methylphenidate, diphenhydramine or placebo on 3 different days and performed behavioral and cognitive tasks including covert orienting of spatial attention and visual search tasks. Subjective and physiologic measures of alertness included EEG frequency analysis, EEG event-related desynchronization, and amount of sleep and sleep onset time in the unstimulated eyes closed state. Performance on the cognitive tasks improved with MP and worsened with DPHA, but there were no specific attentional effects. The best measures of alertness were based on self-rated scales and on EEG recorded in the unstimulated eyes closed state. These observations suggest that methylphenidate and diphenhydramine primarily affected overall state and that healthy humans were able to partially compensate for the pharmacologically induced alertness changes during cognitive task performance.

EEG profile of litoxetine after single and repeated administration in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1994.tb04255.x	1. Litoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with antidepressant activity in animal models and in depressed patients. 2. This double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study was carried out in 12 healthy young male volunteers. The aim was to assess the EEG profile of litoxetine in parallel with its pharmacokinetics after a single dose or multiple administrations for 4 days (6 doses) of two dosages (10 mg and 25 mg). Spectral analysis of four EEG leads (F4-T4, F3-T3, T4-02 and T3-01) was done up to 12 h post-dose. 3. In single or multiple doses, litoxetine induced EEG changes characterised by a dose-related increase in fast beta energies, mainly beta 2, without any changes in slow waves (delta and theta). A slight reduction in alpha activity occurred only after repeated doses. 4. EEG changes occurred after a single oral administration and lasted at least 12 h with litoxetine blood concentrations ranging from 4 to 10 ng ml-1. With repeated administrations, the pharmacodynamic steady-state was achieved as the increase in beta 2 energies was the same before and 12 h post-dose. These effects occurred with litoxetine blood concentrations ranging from 3 to 7 ng ml-1 with the 10 mg dosage and from 8 to 18 ng ml-1 with the 25 mg dosage. The EEG profile did not change after 4 days of repeated administration, indicating that tolerance did not develop. 5. Cmax and AUC showed proportionality between the administered dosages of 10 and 25 mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Braindrug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Piperidinesadministration & dosagepharmacokineticspharmacology', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitorsadministration & dosagepharmacokineticspharmacology']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8186061/	['piperidine', 'LITOXETINE', 'SEROTONIN']	[8082, 65650, 5202]	8186061	['1994', 'Feb']
Assessing the sedative (adverse) effects of antiallergic drugs by quantitative electroencephalography: effects of setastine a non-sedating antihistaminic drug.		"In order to assess the effects of Loderix (setastine) on the EEG ten healthy male volunteers were investigated in double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over arrangement. In addition to the test compound (Loderix) volunteers were treated with vehicle and with two referent drugs (terfenadine, Teldane, and chloropyramine HCl, Suprastin) possessing sedative effects of very different degrees. The different effects of the referent drugs on the central nervous system (CNS) were precisely indicated by the posterior alpha/theta ratio in the EEG. This marker parameter was affected by Loderix in the same direction as by Teldane and in the opposite direction as compared to Suprastin. In addition, Loderix increased the beta frequency range in the median areas of both hemispheres, moreover, it increased the total EEG power. The latter changes raise the question if Loderix has an ""own"" action on the EEG. (The observed ""own"" effect could not even be brought into connection with decrease of the vigilance level). The results strengthen the view that the action of Loderix on the EEG is similar to that of induced by Teldane, a drug very favourable in respect of the sedative side effects. Moreover, the drug did not affect the EEG power spectra in a direction that referred to sedative action. The spectral parameters in the ""pharmaco"" EEG recordings seem to be useful in the objective definition of the central (psychotropic) side-effects of drugs. This is a methodical achievement of the present study."

Development of tolerance after repeated administration of a selective muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden in healthy human volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/0006-3223(93)90138-4	The muscarinic antagonist biperiden produces a dose-dependent inhibition of (REM) sleep on acute administration. The present study addressed the possibility of pharmacological tolerance after repeated biperiden administration. Six healthy volunteers were studied under sleep laboratory conditions in the following situations: one acclimatization, night, two baseline (that were averaged), 4 nights of biperiden administration, and 4 nights of placebo recovery administration. Six milligrams of biperiden and placebo were administered in identical capsules. Volunteers and technicians were blind to the order of the administration of the capsules. REM sleep time was reduced during the first and the second night, but was not significantly different in comparison with baseline by the third night. During placebo recovery nights, REM sleep time was not different from baseline. REM sleep latency was increased during the first and second nights of biperiden administration, but tolerance to this effect was observed by the third night. On placebo nights a dramatic shortening of REM latency was observed. The present findings support the hypothesis that anticholinergic drugs, even a selective M1 antagonist such as biperiden, induce tolerance soon after administration. A similar effect has been reported with scopolamine, a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, but the main difference is that biperiden withdrawal was not followed by an REM sleep rebound. The observed effect on REM sleep latency during placebo administration may be related to a supersensitivity to muscarinic M-1 receptors that trigger the first REM sleep period. Because short REM latency has been the main finding in the sleep of depressed patients, some implications of the present findings are discussed.

Evaluation of antihistamine-related daytime sleepiness. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study with terfenadine.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.1992.tb00678.x	The daytime sleepiness potentially associated with antihistamines was evaluated by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) in a study comparing terfenadine with placebo. According to a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design, 12 healthy men were given either 120 mg terfenadine or placebo once daily in the morning, for 3 consecutive days with a 5-day interval. EEG-polygraphic recordings were made each study day at 9:30 and 11:30 a.m., and 1:30, 3:30, and 5:30 p.m., and the tendency to fall asleep was measured. All mean stage-1 sleep latencies throughout the study failed to show any significant difference between terfenadine and placebo. Accordingly, psychomotor performance assessed by visual and auditory reaction time did not change after treatment. The results of this study confirmed that terfenadine does not induce daytime sleepiness as objectively measured by MSLT.

5-HT2 receptor antagonism and slow-wave sleep in major depression.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1992.tb03241.x	Specific sleep disturbances such as reduced slow-wave sleep (SWS) and decreased serotonergic (5-HT) activity have been observed in depressive disorders. Ritanserin, a specific 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, has been shown to increase SWS in healthy subjects. This study explored the effects of a single dose or ritanserin (5 mg) on sleep electroencephalography in 18 major depressed patients and in 10 control subjects. Ritanserin affected SWS differently in the two groups. Although stage 3 increased significantly in the groups, in contrast to controls, there was no significant effect of ritanserin on stage 4 in depressed patients. In the depressed group, irritability and DSM-III-R melancholic type predicted 40% or the variance of stage 4 increment after ritanserin, as assessed by stepwise multiple regression. These results are in agreement with a potential 5-HT disturbance, particularly at the 5-HT2 receptor level, in some clinical forms of depression.

Placebo controlled comparison of acute effects of ebastine and clemastine on performance and EEG.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00314920	The effects of single oral doses of 10 and 20 mg ebastine were compared with placebo and 2 mg clemastine in a double-blind cross-over study in 16 healthy male volunteers. Clemastine produced the known pattern of changes, namely impairment of psychomotor performance, drowsiness, and a selective effect on cognitive processes. Earlier encoding in a perceptual stage was slowed whereas abstract classification processes were not affected. Electrophysiological measures of vigilance showed a general decrease in vigilance especially 2.5 and 4.5 h after dosing. In contrast at no time was any effect of ebastine different from that of the placebo. Ebastine 10 and 20 mg differed positively from clemastine in its effect on pursuit tracking, subjective rating of drowsiness and general discomfort. Ebastine 10 mg also differed positively from clemastine in the EEG features of vigilance. It is concluded that 10 and 20 mg ebastine were free from sedative adverse effects.

Sleep laboratory studies on the single-dose effects of serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine and fluoxetine on human sleep and awakening qualities.	DOI: 10.1093/sleep/14.5.439	Paroxetine is a novel antidepressant drug with selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitory properties. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover sleep laboratory study the single-dose effects on objective and subjective sleep and awakening qualities were investigated after paroxetine 20, 30 and 40 mg morning doses (PX 20, 30, 40), paroxetine 30 mg evening dose, fluoxetine 40 mg morning dose (FX 40) and placebo in 18 healthy young volunteers. The drugs were orally administered in 2-wk intervals. In addition to each drug night, the adaptation night and washout night were recorded. Polysomnographic investigations (10:30 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) showed a delayed sleep onset only after the morning intake of paroxetine, PX 40 being statistically different from placebo. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency deteriorated under morning PX 30, PX 40 and evening PX 30 as compared to placebo. The nocturnal wake time and sleep stage 1 increased under the paroxetine. Rapid eye movement (REM) reduction (min and %) occurred dose dependently after all paroxetine doses, but the REM latency was lengthened only after the morning intake. The suppressant effect on REM sleep is characteristic for antidepressants and was still significant in the washout nights following PX 40 and evening PX 30. The only statistically relevant finding under 40 mg fluoxetine referred to the increase of REM latency in both drug and washout nights. In contrast to objective results, subjective sleep quality remained generally unchanged. Attention, concentration and reaction performance improved under paroxetine as compared to baseline. The deterioration of well-being under PX 40 might be related to the appearance of drowsiness and nausea. Blood pressure and pulse rate were unaffected.

Relationship of high blood lactate levels with latency of visual-evoked potentials.	DOI: 10.1007/s10072-014-2015-y	We studied, in healthy adult subjects, the association of high blood lactate levels, induced with an exhaustive exercise (12 subjects) or an intravenous infusion (four subjects) of a lactate solution (3 mg/kg in 1 min), with amplitude and latency of visual-evoked potentials. Amplitude of N75, P100, and N145 components did not show significant changes, whereas latency of P100 was reduced at exercise's end and that of N145 increased 10 min after the conclusion. Therefore, an increase of blood lactate induced by an exhaustive exercise or an intravenous infusion appears to induce an improvement in the conduction time between eye and striate cortex, while it seems to evoke a worsening of intracortical communication between striate and extrastriate areas.

Is sleeping sickness a circadian disorder? The serotonergic hypothesis.	DOI: 10.3109/07420529908998722	"Patients with human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, sleeping sickness), due to the inoculation of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or rhodesiense by the tsetse fly, are ""sleepy by day and restless by night."" The first 24 h polysomnographic recording (electroencephalogram [EEG], electromyogram [EMG], electrooculogram [EOG]), showing a disappearance of the 24 h rhythmicity of sleep and wakefulness, was performed in 1988. Thereafter, our team recorded 18 patients and 6 control volunteers at bed rest during 24 h sessions. Blood samples were taken hourly from 8 of the patients through a venous catheter and every 10 minutes from the remaining 10 patients. Plasma cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone (GH), melatonin, and plasma renin activity were analyzed. No disruptions of the circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness were described in the 6 healthy African subjects, and there also were no disturbances of 24 h hormone profiles. The patients experienced a dysregulation of the circadian rhythmicity of sleep and wakefulness that was proportional to the severity of the disease. Sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) episodes were more frequent in the most severely sick patients, who also showed major disruptions in the 24 h plasma hormonal profiles, with intermediate profiles being observed at earlier stages of the sickness. However, the relationship between hormonal secretions and the states of vigilance persisted. Contrary to the other hormones, melatonin secretion remained undisturbed. These findings indicate that, at the stage of meningoencephalitis, HAT represents a dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle and sleep structure, rather than a hypersomnia; this dysregulation is proportional to the degree of severity of the clinical and biological symptoms. It is accompanied by a circadian dysrhythmia of hormonal secretions, although the relationship between hormone pulses and sleep states is preserved. We therefore favor the involvement of the serotonergic raphe nuclei-suprachiasmatic nuclei liaison in the reversible disturbance of the circadian rhythms of the sleep-wake cycle and of hormonal secretions."

Pilocarpine, an orally active muscarinic cholinergic agonist, induces REM sleep and reduces delta sleep in normal volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/0165-1781(90)90064-c	The effect of oral pilocarpine, a direct-acting muscarinic, cholinergic agonist, on polygraphic sleep parameters was studied in 13 healthy male volunteers. Subjects received placebo and oral pilocarpine (25 mg) in a double-blind, counterbalanced, crossover design. Pilocarpine shortened the latency of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increased total REM time, REM%, and the duration of the first REM period. In addition, it reduced Stage 4 sleep and Delta sleep. Pulse rate was not significantly changed during the first hour of darkness after administration of pilocarpine. Subjective sleep experience and the subjects' condition in the morning were not altered. These results suggest that pilocarpine has central effects (i.e., induction of REM sleep) that are similar to those of other centrally acting muscarinic cholinomimetic agents.

Attention changes in epilepsy patients following 3-month topiramate or valproate treatment revealed by event-related potential.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.02.003	The present study was designed to reveal changes of cognitive processes in epilepsy (EP) patients with Topiramate (TPM) or Valproate (VPA) treatment using Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-CR) and event-related potential (ERP). Thirty untreated epilepsy patients were randomly divided into two groups receiving TPM or VPA, respectively. Fifteen healthy volunteers were included as controls. All the patients were examined by WAIS-CR and ERP before and 3 months after drug treatment. Controls were examined by ERP at the time recruited into the study and 3 months later. Unfamiliar grey-scale photographs of faces (front view) were used as stimuli. ERP were recorded at the same time. Mean Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in TPM group decreased after the 3-month treatment (90.40 vs. 81.00, P<0.05). One component of ERP-P300 was smaller in epilepsy patients than controls (P<0.05), but remained unchanged after TPM or VPA treatment (P>0.05). A delayed and smaller N270 was detected in patients compared to controls (P<0.05). After 3 months TPM treatment, it decreased further compared to before treatment (P<0.05). N170 was lower in patient groups, and it became lower after TPM treatment than before. Our results demonstrate that in all epilepsy patients with mild cognitive impairment ERP changes were found. TPM affected the cognitive functions in epilepsy patients reflected by the decreased full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ). The imperative effects of TPM on visual perception function reflected by N170 were more obvious than that of VPA. Attention reflected by N270 was impaired after TPM treatment.

The Lyapunov exponent of the EEG after administration of topiramate.	DOI: 10.1177/155005940503600312	The objective of our study was to investigate the effect of topiramate (TPM) on the Lyapunov exponent of EEG by means of quantitative pharmacoelectroencephalography (QPEEG) and nonlinear analysis methods. One dose of TPM was administrated to epileptics and healthy adults. EEG samples were obtained prior to and at regular intervals (at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours) within the 24 hours following the administration of TPM. EEG activity was processed with nonlinear analysis methods. The Lyapunov exponent of the scalp areas was calculated through 60 s epochs without artifacts after each recording. The statistical difference between baseline predrug assessment and each postdrug control was calculated by computing the paired t test. Results showed that the Lyapunov exponent increased first, then decreased, then increased finally. We conclude that TPM can change the complexity of EEG.

Clinical and electroencephalographic effects of topiramate in patients with epilepsy and healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1097/00002826-200109000-00005	Although topiramate, one of the newer drugs used in treating epilepsy, is effective in reducing seizure frequency and has a wide spectrum of action, it often induces intolerable adverse effects, predominantly related to the central nervous system. Information that would help document adverse reactions early, thus allowing topiramate doses to be adjusted during the drug titration and maintenance phases, could be obtained from electroencephalogram (EEG) studies. We studied the clinical effects and EEG changes induced by topiramate in patients with refractory partial epilepsy receiving the drug as add-on therapy. To exclude effects related to the other drugs and to epilepsy itself, we compared data from patients and healthy volunteers. After receiving topiramate, 22.6% of patients became seizure free and 29% had their seizures reduced by 50% or more. Topiramate nevertheless induced noteworthy adverse reactions, the main problems being sedative and cognitive changes. Also, in healthy volunteers, a single 100-mg dose of topiramate induced mild adverse reactions, mainly affecting concentration and attention, with difficulties in speech and writing. In patients with epilepsy, the EEG changes induced by topiramate consisted of increased delta and theta activities and decreased activity in the rapid bands. This recognizable topiramate-induced EEG pattern was again evident in the healthy volunteers, in whom we also detected a significant reduction in the alpha frequency rhythm. Our results confirm that topiramate needs to be introduced gradually while patients undergo close neuropsychologic and neurophysiologic monitoring to detect adverse sedative and cognitive reactions early. The EEG correlate of these events seems to be increased activity in the slower frequency bands.

Concentration-effect relationships of plasma caffeine on EEG delta power and cardiac autonomic activity during human sleep.	DOI: 10.1111/jsr.14140	Acute caffeine intake affects brain and cardiovascular physiology, yet the concentration-effect relationships on the electroencephalogram and cardiac autonomic activity during sleep are poorly understood. To tackle this question, we simultaneously quantified the plasma caffeine concentration with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, as well as the electroencephalogram, heart rate and high-frequency (0.15-0.4 Hz) spectral power in heart rate variability, representing parasympathetic activity, with standard polysomnography during undisturbed human sleep. Twenty-one healthy young men in randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion, ingested 160 mg caffeine or placebo in a delayed, pulsatile-release caffeine formula at their habitual bedtime, and initiated a 4-hr sleep opportunity 4.5 hr later. The mean caffeine levels during sleep exhibited high individual variability between 0.2 and 18.4 μmol L-1. Across the first two non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM)-rapid-eye-movement sleep cycles, electroencephalogram delta (0.75-2.5 Hz) activity and heart rate were reliably modulated by waking and sleep states. Caffeine dose-dependently reduced delta activity and heart rate, and increased high-frequency heart rate variability in NREM sleep when compared with placebo. The average reduction in heart rate equalled 3.24 ± 0.77 beats per minute. Non-linear statistical models suggest that caffeine levels above ~7.4 μmol L-1 decreased electroencephalogram delta activity, whereas concentrations above ~4.3 μmol L-1 and ~ 4.9 μmol L-1, respectively, reduced heart rate and increased high-frequency heart rate variability. These findings provide quantitative concentration-effect relationships of caffeine, electroencephalogram delta power and cardiac autonomic activity, and suggest increased parasympathetic activity during sleep after intake of caffeine.

Functional ADA polymorphism increases sleep depth and reduces vigilant attention in humans.	DOI: 10.1093/cercor/bhr173	Homeostatically regulated slow-wave oscillations in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep may reflect synaptic changes across the sleep-wake continuum and the restorative function of sleep. The nonsynonymous c.22G>A polymorphism (rs73598374) of adenosine deaminase (ADA) reduces the conversion of adenosine to inosine and predicts baseline differences in sleep slow-wave oscillations. We hypothesized that this polymorphism affects cognitive functions, and investigated whether it modulates electroencephalogram (EEG), behavioral, subjective, and biochemical responses to sleep deprivation. Attention, learning, memory, and executive functioning were quantified in healthy adults. Right-handed carriers of the variant allele (G/A genotype, n = 29) performed worse on the d2 attention task than G/G homozygotes (n = 191). To test whether this difference reflects elevated homeostatic sleep pressure, sleep and sleep EEG before and after sleep deprivation were studied in 2 prospectively matched groups of G/A and G/G genotype subjects. Deep sleep and EEG 0.75- to 1.5-Hz oscillations in non-REM sleep were significantly higher in G/A than in G/G genotype. Moreover, attention and vigor were reduced, whereas waking EEG alpha activity (8.5-12 Hz), sleepiness, fatigue, and α-amylase in saliva were enhanced. These convergent data demonstrate that genetic reduction of ADA activity elevates sleep pressure and plays a key role in sleep and waking quality in humans.

Caffeine modulates P50 auditory sensory gating in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2005.09.001	The P50 suppression paradigm is an index of sensory gating assumed to reflect an inhibitory process. Adenosine is a neuromodulator with mostly inhibitory activity that is released by physiological stimuli and can be blocked by non-selective adenosine receptor antagonists such as theophylline and caffeine. A previous study showed that a single dose of theophylline decreased P50 suppression in healthy volunteers. Here we investigated the effect of caffeine (0, 100, 200 and 400 mg p.o.) on P50 sensory gating in 24 healthy volunteers (15 habitual caffeine high-users and 9 low-users). The 200 and 400 mg doses reduced P50 gating, whereas 100 mg produced a non-significant effect. The effect of caffeine was independent of gender and habitual caffeine intake. High caffeine users also showed baseline differences, with lower S(2) amplitudes compared to low-users. These results reinforce the participation of adenosine in the modulation of P50 sensory gating and suggest that caffeine ingestion should be controlled for in the P50 sensory gating paradigm.

A functional genetic variation of adenosine deaminase affects the duration and intensity of deep sleep in humans.	DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0505414102	Slow, rhythmic oscillations (<5 Hz) in the sleep electroencephalogram may be a sign of synaptic plasticity occurring during sleep. The oscillations, referred to as slow-wave activity (SWA), reflect sleep need and sleep intensity. The amount of SWA is homeostatically regulated. It is enhanced after sleep loss and declines during sleep. Animal studies suggested that sleep need is genetically controlled, yet the physiological mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show in humans that a genetic variant of adenosine deaminase, which is associated with the reduced metabolism of adenosine to inosine, specifically enhances deep sleep and SWA during sleep. In contrast, a distinct polymorphism of the adenosine A(2A) receptor gene, which was associated with interindividual differences in anxiety symptoms after caffeine intake in healthy volunteers, affects the electroencephalogram during sleep and wakefulness in a non-state-specific manner. Our findings indicate a direct role of adenosine in human sleep homeostasis. Moreover, our data suggest that genetic variability in the adenosinergic system contributes to the interindividual variability in brain electrical activity during sleep and wakefulness.

The fixed combination of valerian and hops (Ze91019) acts via a central adenosine mechanism.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2004-827180	The aim of the study was to demonstrate competition between caffeine and a fixed valerian/hop extract combination (Ze91019) by the central adenosine mechanism. EEG was used to describe the action of caffeine on the central nervous system after oral administration (200 mg) in healthy volunteers. In addition to caffeine, the volunteers (16 in each group) received either placebo or verum (2 and 6 tablets containing the valerian/hop extract). The EEG responses were recorded every 30 min thereafter. The verum medication was capable of reducing (2 tablets) or inhibiting (6 tablets) the arousal induced by caffeine. This pharmacodynamic action was observed 60 minutes after oral administration, indicating not only competition between the antagonist caffeine and the partial agonist, i. e., the valerian/hop extract but also bio-availability of the compound(s) responsible for the agonistic action. In conclusion, the valerian/hop extract acts via a central adenosine mechanism which is possibly the reason for its sleep-inducing and -maintaining activity.

Caffeine intake (200 mg) in the morning affects human sleep and EEG power spectra at night.	DOI: 10.1016/0006-8993(95)00040-w	Adenosine has been implicated in the physiological regulation of sleep propensity. The adenosine-receptor-antagonist, caffeine (100 mg), administered immediately prior to a nocturnal sleep episode, has previously been shown to lower sleep propensity as indexed by a reduced sleep efficiency, a reduced EEG power density in low delta frequencies and enhanced power density in the frequency range of sleep spindles. To further investigate the role of adenosine in sleep regulation we administered 200 mg of caffeine at 07.10 h and analyzed the sleep stages and EEG power spectra during the subsequent night in nine healthy men. Caffeine levels in saliva decreased from a maximum of 17 mumol/l one hour after intake, to 3 mumol/l immediately prior to the sleep episode starting at 23.00 h. Compared to placebo, sleep efficiency and total sleep time were significantly reduced. EEG power density in nonREM sleep was suppressed in the 0.25-0.5 Hz band and enhanced in the frequency range of sleep spindles (11.25-12.0 Hz and 13.25-14.0 Hz). In REM sleep EEG power density was suppressed in the frequency range of 0.75-4.5 and 5.25-6.0 Hz. The data indicate that a saliva level of caffeine as low as 3 mumol/l directly affects sleep propensity or, alternatively, that the presence of caffeine in the central nervous system during the waking episode reduces the progressive increase of sleep propensity associated with wakefulness.

Adenosine stimulation, ventilation, and arousal from sleep.	DOI: 10.1164/ajrccm/145.2_Pt_1.453	The mechanism for arousal from sleep resulting from respiratory stimuli is unclear. We hypothesized that arousal is a result of increasing ventilation during sleep. To determine if this is true we compared minute ventilation at the point of arousal from non-REM sleep produced by the respiratory stimulant adenosine to that resulting from progressive hypercapnic stimulation. If this hypothesis is correct, the quantity of breathing immediately preceding arousal from sleep should be similar for each stimulus. We monitored electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), end-tidal CO2, and inspired minute ventilation (VI) in five healthy young men during full-night sleep studies. Sleep state was monitored during the baseline state, during an intravenous infusion of 80 micrograms/kg/min of adenosine, and during multiple trials of progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia. Arousal from sleep occurred in association with increased breathing 4.2 +/- 1.1 times during adenosine infusion, 2.0 +/- 0 times during hypercapnic stimulation, and 4.0 +/- 0.6 times in the absence of stimulated breathing (spontaneously) per subject. Minute ventilation for the breath preceding arousal associated with adenosine stimulation (13.0 +/- 1.4 L/min) was similar to that preceding arousal caused by hypercapnia (12.9 +/- 1.1 L/min). In each case this level of breathing was greater than that preceding spontaneously occurring arousals (8.2 +/- 1.1 L/min), p less than 0.05). Although variable between subjects, there was a high correlation for these two variables within subjects (R = 0.96, p = 0.01). These data support the hypothesis that increasing ventilation induces arousal from sleep when ventilation is increased regardless of the stimulus producing this rising drive to breathe.

Neurologic manifestations of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in childhood.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2011.02.010	The neurologic manifestations and prognoses of a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in previously healthy children were evaluated. Nose and throat swabs were retrieved from all patients who met the criteria of influenza-like illness. A real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay was used to confirm the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. This viral infection was evident in 240 children between October 10 and December 22, 2009. Neurologic findings were evident in 17 (7.08%) patients, aged between 4 months and 8 years. Nine were boys. Five patients manifested simple febrile seizures, seven manifested complex febrile seizures or additional afebrile seizures, and three manifested encephalopathy. Febrile status epilepticus and flaccid paralysis were diagnosed in one patient each. All were treated with oseltamivir. Fifteen of 17 patients demonstrated complete recovery. One undergoing follow-up with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome manifested sequelae. One patient died because of septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation. We suggest that neurologic manifestations occur quite often in children aged less than 5 years with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. Most infections were benign, although a severe course is possible, and sequelae may be encountered.

Absence of adverse effects of oseltamivir on sleep: a double-blind, randomized study in healthy volunteers in Japan.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2011.00726.x	Influenza-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms include parasomnias such as sleepwalking which is a common sleep disturbance in childhood. Oseltamivir is a widely used antiviral drug for influenza. Recently, sleepwalking-like events have been reported in patients with influenza receiving oseltamivir. We investigated whether oseltamivir itself has effects on sleep. In this crossover study, healthy Japanese male volunteers were randomized into two treatment groups, each of which comprised two double-blind 4-day treatment periods. In the first period, group A received 75 mg oseltamivir (evening dose) on day 3, followed by 75 mg b.i.d. on day 4, and placebo in the second period. Group B received the same treatments, but in reverse order. Polysomnographic assessments were performed on all four nights of each treatment period. Pharmacokinetics were assessed during a 2-day open-label phase beginning on day 12. Thirty-one volunteers aged 20-24 years were enrolled. No volunteer had electroencephalographic abnormalities, and no abnormal behaviour was observed. Sleep parameters measured over the whole night and during early- and late sleep periods (first and last thirds of the night) were very similar for oseltamivir and placebo, although the amount of stage 2 sleep in the middle sleep period was slightly greater with oseltamivir. Pharmacokinetics for oseltamivir phosphate in groups A and B were very similar, but for oseltamivir carboxylate, AUC and C(max) values were higher in group B, probably because this group received oseltamivir on the evening of day 11. Oseltamivir was well tolerated. Oseltamivir did not produce clinically relevant changes on nocturnal polysomnographic variables in young Japanese men.

Reductions in circulating endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels in healthy human subjects exposed to chronic stressors.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2016.01.004	Increasing evidence indicates that chronic stress, such as social isolation, plays an important role in the development of a variety of psychiatric and somatic disorders. Meanwhile, chronic stress imposed by prolonged isolation and confinement in the spacecraft is also one of the major concerns for the health of future interplanetary space travelers. Preclinical studies suggest that the peripheral endocannabinoid (eCB) system is involved in the regulation of the stress response and eCB signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of stress-related diseases. However, there are only few human studies addressing this topic, of which most focusing on patients who have already developed a certain type of disorder. It remains unknown whether chronic stress may affect eCB signaling in healthy humans. A 520-d isolation and confinement study simulating a flight to Mars provided an extraordinary chance to study the effects of prolonged stress in healthy humans. During the study period, the participants lived in confinement and could not meet their families, friends, or strangers for more than 500 days. We examined the impact of chronic exposure to isolation and confinement through monitoring their psychological state, brain cortical activity, sympathetic adrenal-medullary system response and eCB signaling response. We observed reduced positive emotion ratings, decreased brain cortical activities and high levels of catecholamine release, indicating that prolonged exposure to isolation and confinement stressors may bring about changes both psychologically and physiologically. Importantly, for eCB signaling response, blood concentrations of eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), but not anandamide (AEA), were significantly reduced (p<0.001), suggesting that dysregulation of 2-AG signaling might be specifically implicated in the response to chronic stressors.

Vitamin B-6 supplementation and theophylline-related effects in humans.	DOI: 10.1093/ajcn/60.1.93	This study investigates whether vitamin B-6 supplementation reduces the stimulatory effects of theophylline (a pyridoxal kinase antagonist) on the nervous system. Twenty young, healthy adults entered this double-blind, randomized, crossover study but only 15 completed the experiment. The dependent measures were a battery of psychomotor tests, electrophysiological tests, and self-report questionnaires. Most tests, including spectral electroencephalography, aspects of the electromyograph, the Sternberg Test of information processing, and questionnaires of sleep quality and daytime sleepiness failed to distinguish between vitamin B-6 and placebo supplementation. However, theophylline-related tremor was markedly reduced (p < 0.01) with vitamin B-6 supplementation after a single dose of theophylline and a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed with repeated doses. There was a tendency for vitamin B-6 supplementation to reduce many side effects related to nervous system function. These findings suggest that vitamin B-6 supplementation with theophylline therapy may have some beneficial effects.

Serologic marker of acute motor axonal neuropathy in childhood.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2008.03.014	Guillain-Barré syndrome is divided into two subtypes: acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and acute motor axonal neuropathy. Autoantibodies to gangliosides GM1, GM1b, GD1a, or GalNAc-GD1a were proposed as serologic markers of acute motor axonal neuropathy in adults. In a previous study of Japanese children with Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute motor axonal neuropathy was associated with anti-GM1 immunoglobulin G antibodies. Larger, comprehensive studies are required to confirm this finding. The present study revealed that immunoglobulin G antibodies were against GM1 (34%), GM1b (22%), GD1a (25%), GalNAc-GD1a (13%), and any of these (44%) in 32 Japanese children with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Patients who had the autoantibodies more often manifested previous diarrhea (71% vs 11%, P = 0.001), acute motor axonal neuropathy (64% vs 11%, P = 0.003), and slower recovery (healthy at final follow-up: 29% vs 78%, P = 0.011; able to run with minor signs, 64% vs 11%, P = 0.003) than patients who did not. The clinical features were consistent with those in adults carrying anti-ganglioside antibodies. Anti-ganglioside antibody testing may help predict outcomes in pediatric patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome who prefer not to undergo repeated nerve-conduction studies.

We examined, first, the influence of DSIP on ACTH and cortisol release following stimulation with human corticotropin-releasing hormone (h-CRH; 1.0 microgram/kg body weight, and 0.5 microgram/kg body weight, respectively) in healthy young men (n = 5 in each condition). DSIP (total doses of 3 and 4 mg, respectively, vs. placebo) was infused intravenously between 30 min prior to and 90 min after CRH injections. Responses of ACTH and cortisol were almost identical during and after infusion of DSIP and placebo. In a second experiment, the influence of DSIP (4 mg, also administered as intravenous infusion) on meal-related ACTH and cortisol secretion was studied in another 10 men. Meal-related midday surge of ACTH and cortisol was also not affected by DSIP. Our data do not support an inhibitory role of DSIP on ACTH and cortisol secretion in man.

Influences of peripheral adrenocorticotropin 1-39 (ACTH) and human corticotropin releasing hormone (h-CRH) on human auditory evoked potentials (AEP).	DOI: 10.1007/BF02253714	Hormones of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis have been considered to form part of an efferent humoral system modulating central nervous stimulus processing. The present experiments were designed to compare the effects of iv bolus administrations of placebo, porcine ACTH 1-39 (1.5 U) and h-CRH (25 micrograms) on auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in healthy men. Also, cardiovascular parameters, cortisol and self-reported mood were assessed. ACTH significantly reduced the amplitude of the N1 component of the AEP; P1 and P2 remained unchanged. The selective reduction of N1 amplitude defies an interpretation of the changes in terms of a reduced stimulus-induced cortical arousal following ACTH; the ACTH-induced changes may rather indicate an influence on frontocortical functions of directing attention. The effect of ACTH on N1 cannot be attributed to its adrenocorticotropic action or to cardiovascular changes, but appears to represent an intrinsic extraadrenal influence of the hormone. The data do not provide evidence for effects of h-CRH on central nervous stimulus processing in humans, after peripheral administration.

Pharmacodynamic profile of the M1 agonist talsaclidine in animals and man.	DOI: 10.1016/s0024-3205(01)01057-8	In functional pharmacological assays, talsaclidine has been described as a functionally preferential M1 agonist with full intrinsic activity, and less pronounced effects at M2- and M3 receptors. In accordance with this, cholinomimetic central activation measured in rabbits by EEG recordings occurred at a 10 fold lower dose than that inducing predominantly M3-mediated side effects. This pharmacological profile is also reflected in the clinical situation: Both in healthy volunteers and in Alzheimer patients--unlike after unspecific receptor stimulation through cholinesterase inhibitors--the mainly M3-mediated gastrointestinal effects (like nausea and vomiting) were not dose-limiting. Rather, sweating and hypersalivation, mediated through muscarinic receptors, occurred dose-dependently and were finally dose-limiting. In contrast to talsaclidine, sabcomeline had a less pronounced functional M1 selectivity in pharmacological assays. This was also shown in anaesthetized guinea pigs where sabcomeline alone induced bronchoconstriction, and in the rabbit EEG where central activation and cholinergic side effects occurred in the same dose range. Neither drug, however, showed convincing improvement of cognitive functions in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. This asks for a reassessment of the muscarinic hypothesis for the treatment of this disease.

The spectrum from BCECTS to LKS: The Rolandic EEG trait-impact on cognition.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2006.00694.x	The laboratory hallmark of BCECTS is the rolandic discharge (RD) in the EEG of patients, occurring in a characteristic topographical, vigilance-related, event-related, and age-related pattern, disappearing during puberty. RDs are present in 2% of healthy children. About 8% of children with RDs have epilepsy. An increased prevalence rate of RDs is found in children with cognitive and behavioral disorders, with headaches and some genetic syndromes. In some patients, the cognitive disorders are transient but in others they are progressive, resulting in stable mental retardation after puberty. A recent study of 36 BCECTS patients addressed the following questions. (1) the possible relationship between the severity of RDs and the neuropsychological deficits; (2) the profile of neuropsychological deficits; (3) changes of cognition related to EEG changes; and (4) effects of therapy. No correlation was found between global IQ and the severity of the RDs. All the children had at least one specific learning disorder (sometimes long-lasting). When the children were treated, a correlation between cognitive and EEG improvement could not be demonstrated. Recently, 21 patients without epilepsy but with attention deficit and hyperactivity and/or learning disorders were studied: an open treatment trial with sulthiame resulted in improved sustained and selective attention. The neurobiology of RDs and their relationship to cognitive dysfunction and epilepsy requires further study.

P50 sensory gating deficit in children with centrotemporal spikes and sharp waves in the EEG.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2005.09.071	Sensory gating refers to the ability of the brain to inhibit irrelevant sensory input. In several studies, a pathogenic role of the CHRNA7 gene and the CHRNA7-like gene, respectively, is suggested. In linkage analysis concerning familial centrotemporal spikes and sharp waves (CTS) and benign rolandic epilepsy, evidence for linkage was found to a region on chromosome 15q14, close to the alpha-7 subunit gene of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA7). According to these findings, P50 evoked potentials to paired click stimuli were studied in 13 children with CTS in the EEG to determine whether they had normal sensory gating. The control group consisted of 13 healthy probands matched for gender and age. Children with CTS showed a significant sensory gating deficit (p=0.001). These results (1) suggest an inhibitory deficit in early pre-attentive auditory sensory processing in children with CTS and (2) confirm the assumption of a cholinergic pathology in CTS.

Cyclic alternating pattern in infants with congenital hypothyroidism.	DOI: 10.1016/j.braindev.2018.07.002	Congenital hypothyroidism is defined as thyroid hormone deficiency present at birth which is crucial for brain development. Recently, the cyclic alternating pattern, a rhythm present in electroencephalography recordings in non-Rapid eye movement sleep, has been related to brain development and cognition in different pediatric conditions. Therefore, we evaluated the cyclic alternating pattern rate in infants with congenital hypothyroidism, thyroxine supplementation, and healthy controls. The parameters of the cyclic alternating pattern were evaluated in 19 healthy infants (10 female, mean age 25.5 ± 15.5 months) and 21 infants diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism (19 female, mean age 24.3 ± 19.0 months). We considered the transient electro-cortical activations (phase A of the cycle) in non-Rapid eye movement sleep and the subdivisions of the A phase in: A1, A2 and A3, based on their frequency content. All subjects were subjected to polysomnography recording in a standard laboratory setting. Sleep data were stored computer following the International 10-20 System. Data showed that congenital hypothyroidism infants exhibited higher frequency of central apnea, hypopnea, and arousals in comparison to controls. Particularly, central apnea index decreased with age in the control group but not in congenital hypothyroidism group. Regarding to cyclic alternating pattern measurements, congenital hypothyroidism infants exhibit a higher frequency in the percentage of A3 subtype (electroencephalographic desynchrony) and conversely a lower percentage of A1 subtype (electroencephalographic synchrony), than healthy infants. An important finding of this study is the positive correlation between A1 mean duration and age, which is bigger in control group than in congenital hypothyroidism group (time duration in control group (0.52 s/month) versus congenital hypothyroidism group (0.1 s/month). Infants with congenital hypothyroidism showed an increase of A3 subtype, of central apnea, and of arousals. The reduction of percentage and mean duration of A1 subtype could be a valuable indicator of sleep development in patients with congenital hypothyroidism and healthy infants.

Higher plasma IGF-1 levels are associated with increased delta sleep in healthy older men.	DOI: 10.1093/gerona/50a.4.m222	Sleep quality declines with age, with less time in deep or slow wave sleep (SWS) and reduced amplitude of the delta waves that characterize it. Age-related declines also occur in lean body mass, growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). These changes in sleep quality and anabolic status may be related, as administration of GH or growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) can enhance SWS and decrease awakenings in young men.

Thyroid hormones influence perceptual processing in a visual search paradigm.		The mechanisms that mediate the effects of thyroid hormones on higher cognitive processes are not well understood. In the present experiments, event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral measurements were recorded in a visual search paradigm where a target item had to be detected in a number of distractor items. 10 healthy subjects were given a daily dose 300 micrograms thyroxine (T4) p.o. and recordings were made before and after 3 weeks of treatment. All subjects developed hyperthyroidism with a completely suppressed TSH (1.6 +/- 0.5 mU/l vs. non detectable), a significant increase in T3 (1.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.2 ng/ml). T4 (6.6 +/- 1.6 micrograms/dl vs 11.9 +/- 2.7 micrograms/dl) and sex-hormone binding globulin (2.9 +/- 1.1 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.3 micrograms/ml; all p less than 0.0005). Compared to the control group (n = 15), thyroid hormones improved controlled serial visual processing, as indexed by changes of the late positive ERP component and target detection hit rate (in both cases p less than 0.01), whereas parallel detection of salient features remained unchanged. The data suggest a differential impact of thyroid hormones on visual information processing.

Critical dynamics in spontaneous EEG predict anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness and perturbational complexity.	DOI: 10.1038/s42003-024-06613-8	Consciousness has been proposed to be supported by electrophysiological patterns poised at criticality, a dynamical regime which exhibits adaptive computational properties, maximally complex patterns and divergent sensitivity to perturbation. Here, we investigate dynamical properties of the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) of healthy subjects undergoing general anesthesia with propofol, xenon or ketamine. Importantly, all participants were unresponsive under anesthesia, while consciousness was retained only during ketamine anesthesia (in the form of vivid dreams), enabling an experimental dissociation between unresponsiveness and unconsciousness. For each condition, we measure (i) avalanche criticality, (ii) chaoticity, and (iii) criticality-related metrics, revealing that states of unconsciousness are characterized by a distancing from both avalanche criticality and the edge of chaos. We then ask whether these same dynamical properties are predictive of the perturbational complexity index (PCI), a TMS-based measure that has shown remarkably high sensitivity in detecting consciousness independently of behavior. We successfully predict individual subjects' PCI values with considerably high accuracy from resting-state EEG dynamical properties alone. Our results establish a firm link between perturbational complexity and criticality, and provide further evidence that criticality is a necessary condition for the emergence of consciousness.

Psychophysiological Analysis of Thymoleptic Effects of Xenon in Humans.	DOI: 10.1007/s10517-020-04846-1	This pilot study was aimed at evaluation of the translational potential of xenon as a potential antidepressant. In placebo-controlled double-blind study, 14 healthy right-handed volunteers were randomly assigned to 15-min inhalation session of either gas mixture with xenon (25%Хе/30%О2/45%N2) or placebo (70%N2/30%О2) with simultaneous recording of 64-channel EEG. To assess the dynamics and nature of emotional activation in response to xenon and placebo, we analyzed both the intensity of positive and negative emotions and individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF) of EEG. We found that xenon in sub-anesthetic doses promoted positive emotional arousal, and that emotional response to xenon depended on individual neurophysiological endophenotype of alpha-activity (iAPF). The authors suggest that iAPF shifts can be used as a neurophysiological predictor of individual thymoleptic response to xenon.

TMS as a pharmacodynamic indicator of cortical activity of a novel anti-epileptic drug, XEN1101.

XEN1101 is a novel potassium channel opener undergoing clinical development for treatment of epilepsy.

The spectral exponent of the resting EEG indexes the presence of consciousness during unresponsiveness induced by propofol, xenon, and ketamine.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.01.024	Despite the absence of responsiveness during anesthesia, conscious experience may persist. However, reliable, easily acquirable and interpretable neurophysiological markers of the presence of consciousness in unresponsive states are still missing. A promising marker is based on the decay-rate of the power spectral density (PSD) of the resting EEG. We acquired resting electroencephalogram (EEG) in three groups of healthy participants (n = 5 each), before and during anesthesia induced by either xenon, propofol or ketamine. Dosage of each anesthetic agent was tailored to yield unresponsiveness (Ramsay score = 6). Delayed subjective reports assessed whether conscious experience was present ('Conscious report') or absent/inaccessible to recall ('No Report'). We estimated the decay of the PSD of the resting EEG-after removing oscillatory peaks-via the spectral exponent β, for a broad band (1-40 Hz) and narrower sub-bands (1-20 Hz, 20-40 Hz). Within-subject anesthetic changes in β were assessed. Furthermore, based on β, 'Conscious report' states were discriminated against 'no report' states. Finally, we evaluated the correlation of the resting spectral exponent with a recently proposed index of consciousness, the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI), derived from a previous TMS-EEG study. The spectral exponent of the resting EEG discriminated states in which consciousness was present (wakefulness, ketamine) from states where consciousness was reduced or abolished (xenon, propofol). Loss of consciousness substantially decreased the (negative) broad-band spectral exponent in each subject undergoing xenon or propofol anesthesia-indexing an overall steeper PSD decay. Conversely, ketamine displayed an overall PSD decay similar to that of wakefulness-consistent with the preservation of consciousness-yet it showed a flattening of the decay in the high-frequencies (20-40 Hz)-consistent with its specific mechanism of action. The spectral exponent was highly correlated to PCI, corroborating its interpretation as a marker of the presence of consciousness. A steeper PSD of the resting EEG reliably indexed unconsciousness in anesthesia, beyond sheer unresponsiveness.

Recording Brain Electromagnetic Activity During the Administration of the Gaseous Anesthetic Agents Xenon and Nitrous Oxide in Healthy Volunteers.	DOI: 10.3791/56881	Anesthesia arguably provides one of the only systematic ways to study the neural correlates of global consciousness/unconsciousness. However to date most neuroimaging or neurophysiological investigations in humans have been confined to the study of γ-Amino-Butyric-Acid-(GABA)-receptor-agonist-based anesthetics, while the effects of dissociative N-Methyl-D-Aspartate-(NMDA)-receptor-antagonist-based anesthetics ketamine, nitrous oxide (N2O) and xenon (Xe) are largely unknown. This paper describes the methods underlying the simultaneous recording of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) from healthy males during inhalation of the gaseous anesthetic agents N2O and Xe. Combining MEG and EEG data enables the assessment of electromagnetic brain activity during anesthesia at high temporal, and moderate spatial, resolution. Here we describe a detailed protocol, refined over multiple recording sessions, that includes subject recruitment, anesthesia equipment setup in the MEG scanner room, data collection and basic data analysis. In this protocol each participant is exposed to varying levels of Xe and N2O in a repeated measures cross-over design. Following relevant baseline recordings participants are exposed to step-wise increasing inspired concentrations of Xe and N2O of 8, 16, 24 and 42%, and 16, 32 and 47% respectively, during which their level of responsiveness is tracked with an auditory continuous performance task (aCPT). Results are presented for a number of recordings to highlight the sensor-level properties of the raw data, the spectral topography, the minimization of head movements, and the unequivocal level dependent effects on the auditory evoked responses. This paradigm describes a general approach to the recording of electromagnetic signals associated with the action of different kinds of gaseous anesthetics, which can be readily adapted to be used with volatile and intravenous anesthetic agents. It is expected that the method outlined can contribute to the understanding of the macro-scale mechanisms of anesthesia by enabling methodological extensions involving source space imaging and functional network analysis.

Consciousness and Complexity during Unresponsiveness Induced by Propofol, Xenon, and Ketamine.	DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2015.10.014	"A common endpoint of general anesthetics is behavioral unresponsiveness, which is commonly associated with loss of consciousness. However, subjects can become disconnected from the environment while still having conscious experiences, as demonstrated by sleep states associated with dreaming. Among anesthetics, ketamine is remarkable in that it induces profound unresponsiveness, but subjects often report ""ketamine dreams"" upon emergence from anesthesia. Here, we aimed at assessing consciousness during anesthesia with propofol, xenon, and ketamine, independent of behavioral responsiveness. To do so, in 18 healthy volunteers, we measured the complexity of the cortical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)--an approach that has proven helpful in assessing objectively the level of consciousness irrespective of sensory processing and motor responses. In addition, upon emergence from anesthesia, we collected reports about conscious experiences during unresponsiveness. Both frontal and parietal TMS elicited a low-amplitude electroencephalographic (EEG) slow wave corresponding to a local pattern of cortical activation with low complexity during propofol anesthesia, a high-amplitude EEG slow wave corresponding to a global, stereotypical pattern of cortical activation with low complexity during xenon anesthesia, and a wakefulness-like, complex spatiotemporal activation pattern during ketamine anesthesia. Crucially, participants reported no conscious experience after emergence from propofol and xenon anesthesia, whereas after ketamine they reported long, vivid dreams unrelated to the external environment. These results are relevant because they suggest that brain complexity may be sensitive to the presence of disconnected consciousness in subjects who are considered unconscious based on behavioral responses."

Xenon does not affect gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor binding in humans.	DOI: 10.1213/01.ane.0000287658.14763.13	The noble gas xenon acts as an anesthetic with favorable hemodynamic and neuroprotective properties. Based on animal and in vitro data, it is thought to exert its anesthetic effects by inhibiting glutamatergic signaling, but effects on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors also have been reported. The mechanism of anesthetic action of xenon in the living human brain still remains to be determined.

The effects of subanaesthetic concentrations of xenon in volunteers.	DOI: 10.1046/j.0003-2409.2001.02455.x	This study reports the subjective, psychomotor and physiological properties of subanaesthetic concentrations of xenon. Ten healthy male volunteers received either xenon or nitrous oxide in a randomised crossover study design. The subjects breathed either xenon (Xe) or nitrous oxide (N2O) from a closed circuit breathing system, according to a randomised, double-blind protocol. The concentration of xenon required to produce sedation, ranged between 27 and 45% (median 35%). All subjects completed the xenon protocol. Subjects were tested using the Critical Flicker Fusion test and derived electroencephalogram parameters, however, neither test was found to reliably predict sedation. The respiratory rate decreased markedly during sedation with xenon. The subjects did not experience any airway irritability (coughing, breath-holding or laryngospasm) during administration of either gas. One subject required anti-emetic treatment in the N2O group compared to none in the Xe group. Eight subjects reported that they found sedation with xenon pleasant and preferable to nitrous oxide. Xenon sedation was well tolerated and was not associated with any adverse physiological effects, however, it was reported to be subjectively dissimilar to nitrous oxide.

Long-term effects of boxing and judo-choking techniques on brain function.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02341784	Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by 133-xenon inhalation in 24 amateur and 20 professional boxers, and in 10 judoka. Results were compared with those from age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Eighteen boxers (9 amateurs and 9 professionals) and all judoka also underwent electroencephalography (EEG). Mean rCBF values did not differ between either amateur boxers orjudoka and controls, whereas in professional boxers rCBF was significantly (p<.001) reduced in the whole brain, especially in the frontocentral regions. Healthy subjects, judoka, and amateur boxers showed a similar distribution of global CBF (gCBF, the mean of 32 probes) values, although 12.5% of amateurs had a significantly lower gCBF than controls. Among professional boxers, 25% showed a significantly low gCBF value; in the remaining 75%, gCBF was below the mean value of controls but did not reach statistical significance. Regional hypoperfusion, mainly in the frontocentral regions of both sides, was found in 35% of professional and in 29% of amateur boxers. A correlation between gCBF values and number of official matches was not found in boxers. EEG was normal in all judoka and amateur boxers, but it was abnormal in 3 professionals. This study shows the relevance of the neurophysiological assessment of athletes engaged in violent sports which can cause brain impairment. In fact, while professional boxers may show brain functional impairment in comparison to normal subjects, judoka do not. The lack of correlation between CBF values in boxers and the number of official matches points to the difficulty of taking into account variables, such as the number and the severity of matches during training.

Quantitative electroencephalography and regional cerebral blood flow: discriminant analysis between Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls.	DOI: 10.1159/000017072	Forty-two patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 18 elderly healthy controls underwent quantitative EEG (qEEG) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF; 133Xe clearance) examinations. Correlations were sought between relative qEEG band powers and percent rCBF values in a posterior temporoparietal region of interest in either hemisphere. Moreover, stepwise discriminant analysis was applied to study the accuracy of the two techniques in differentiating AD from healthy ageing. rCBF and qEEG were correlated with one another, especially in the right hemisphere (p values ranging from <0.001 to <0.01). Significant correlations were found between Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and relative power of both the 2- to 6-Hz and the 6.5- to 12-Hz bands on either side (p < 0.001), and between MMSE and left rCBF (p < 0.005), while the correlation with right rCBF was poorer (p < 0.02). The statistical procedure identified the right values of both examinations for the discriminant analysis. Sensitivity of qEEG and rCBF employed together was 88% and specificity 89%, with a total accuracy of 88.3%. The unrecognized patients (n = 5) were affected by mild AD (4 scoring 3 at the Global Deterioration Scale and 1 scoring 4). qEEG alone showed an accuracy of 77% in the whole group and of 69% in mild AD, and rCBF alone an accuracy of 75% in the whole group and of 71% in mild AD. It is concluded that qEEG and rCBF examinations employed together are accurate tools to differentiate AD from normal ageing, although a lower degree of accuracy is achieved in mildly demented patients.

Correlation between contingent negative variation and regional cerebral blood flow.	DOI: 10.1177/155005949802900303	The relationship between contingent negative variation (CNV) and regional cerebral blood flow was investigated, using the stable xenon computed tomography method. Seventeen cases of chronic multiple cerebral infarction in the perforating artery areas (vascular dementia, mean age 67.0), 6 cases of Alzheimer's disease (mean age 69.5) and 8 healthy controls (mean age 62.5) were studied. Regional cerebral blood flows in the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortex, frontal, temporal and occipital white matter, caudate nucleus, putamen and thalamus were measured. The amplitude of early CNV was significantly smaller in the vascular dementia group than in the healthy control group. The blood flows in the parietal cortex and thalamus were significantly lower in the vascular dementia group than in the healthy control group. There was a significant positive correlation between the amplitude of early CNV and frontal cortex blood flow. No significant correlations were present between the CNV and the other regional cerebral blood flows nor in healthy controls. The amplitude of CNV has been reported to be decreased in dementia. From the present study, the amplitude of early CNV was considered to be influenced by the blood flow in the frontal cortex.

Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in migraine during the interictal period: different rCBF patterns in patients with and without aura.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1468-2982.1996.1603161.x	The aim of this study was to evaluate the rCBF (133Xe clearance method) in migrainous patients free from attack. Fifty patients suffering from migraine without aura (group M) and 20 suffering from migraine with aura (group MA) (age range 20-50 years) were submitted to 32 channel rCBF mapping during the interictal period. The rCBF data of patients were compared with those obtained from 60 healthy control subjects (group C) and 21 patients suffering from tension-type headache (group TH). The mean (average of all channels) rCBF values were: group M = 70.5 +/- 13.7 ml/100g/min; group MA = 56.6 +/- 11.4 ml/100g/min; group C = 62.3 +/- 8.3 ml/100g/min; group TH = 62.1 +/- 8.4 ml/100g/min (F = 11.93; p < 0.001). As expected, patients belonging to group TH had a normal rCBF. The mean rCBF of group M was significantly higher than that of groups C and TH, while in group MA it was significantly lower than in groups C and TH. Group M showed a diffuse hyperemia, while group MA showed rCBF values significantly lower than normal in posterior regions, according to aura. Our results suggest that: (a) the rCBF pattern in migrainous patients is different from that in both controls and TH patients, even during the interictal period; (b) patients suffering from migraine with and without aura are two distinct subpopulations with opposite rCBF deviations.

Cerebral oxygen metabolism and cerebral blood flow in man during light sleep (stage 2).	DOI: 10.1016/0006-8993(91)90137-k	We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) during light sleep (stage 2) in 8 young healthy volunteers using the Kety-Schmidt technique with 133Xe as the inert gas. Measurements were performed during wakefulness and light sleep as verified by standard polysomnography. Unlike our previous study in man showing a highly significant 25% decrease in CMRO2 during deep sleep (stage 3-4) we found a modest but statistically significant decrease of 5% in CMRO2 during stage 2 sleep. Deep and light sleep are both characterized by an almost complete lack of mental activity. They differ in respect of arousal threshold as a stronger stimulus is required to awaken a subject from deep sleep as compared to light sleep. Our results suggest that during non-rapid eye movement sleep cerebral metabolism and thereby cerebral synaptic activity is correlated to cerebral readiness rather than to mental activity.

Circadian changes of left ventricular ejection fraction in normal subjects.	DOI: 10.3109/07420529409057241	Sleep has a specific physiology with related cardiovascular changes. We have previously found in respiratory patients [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)] an unexpected decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at waking in the morning when compared with the rest period during the day. Whether this observation was linked to the consequences of the respiratory abnormalities or reflected physiological fluctuations related to the changes in autonomic nervous system tone remained unknown. Thus, we have set out to analyze the changes in LVEF with sleep in normal individuals. Eight healthy young men had LVEF measured before and after submaximal exercise, at rest before bedtime, and on waking in the morning. Technetium-99m with in vivo red cell labelling was used. Sleep parameters were assessed using classical polysomnography. In order to detect any influence of autonomic nervous system stimulation on LVEF, sympathovagal tone (SVT) was also assessed during night-time LVEF measurements using spectral analysis of RR intervals. LVEF at rest was within the normal limits for all the subjects (range 51-62%). On submaximal exercise, the LVEF increased in four subjects, was unchanged in two, and decreased in two. The main result concerns the changes in LVEF overnight. In the morning, LVEF decreased dramatically in three subjects and reached a level of < 30% in four. These decreases in LVEF were not related to changes in SVT or sleep structure. LVEF values returned to normal in 30 min. The LVEF changes during exercise are in accordance with previous data in the literature. The dramatic decrease in LVEF observed in the morning could be related either to vascular resistance changes or to nocturnal variations in cardiac contractility, which both need further studies to be established.

The search for the relationship between female hormonal status, alpha oscillations, and aperiodic features of resting state EEG.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2024.112312	Fluctuations in sex steroid levels during the menstrual cycle and the use of hormonal contraceptives have been linked to changes in cognitive function and emotions in females. Such variations may be mediated by overall brain activity and excitability. We aimed to investigate the impact of female hormonal status on resting state EEG (rsEEG) parameters, including periodic (individual alpha frequency, alpha power) and aperiodic (1/f slope) features. rsEEG was recorded in healthy females (mean age 26.4 ± 4.6 years), who were naturally cycling in the early follicular (n = 33) or mid-luteal phases (n = 35), or who used either oral contraceptives (n = 35) or hormonal intrauterine devices (n = 28). Salivary concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone were measured. Contrary to previous findings, this study did not reveal significant differences in rsEEG parameters between groups or significant relationships with hormonal levels. Age emerged as a covariate negatively related to the median 1/f slope. Based on these findings, we found no significant evidence to suggest that the periodic (alpha power and peak frequency) or aperiodic activity patterns in the brain during the resting state differ between the groups of females under investigation.

Testosterone administration enhances the expectation and perception of painful and non-painful somatosensory stimuli.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2023.106081	The influence of testosterone on pain perception remains inconsistent in the literature. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study investigated the effect of testosterone administration on perception and expectation of electrocutaneous stimulus. Thirty healthy male participants received a single dose of testosterone in one session and a placebo in the other session. For each session, they completed a pain-rating task in which a predictability cue was inserted before a painful or non-painful electocutaneous stimulus delivery, while neural activity was simultaneously recorded by a 64-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) system. Expected and perceived pain ratings, as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) to electocutaneous stimuli and prestimulus EEG oscillatory activities while expecting upcoming electocutaneous stimuli were comprehensively compared between testosterone and placebo sessions. Compared with the placebo session, participants in the testosterone session reported greater pain rating and exhibited greater amplitude of N1 component on ERPs when perceiving both painful and non-painful electrocutaneous stimuli. Mediation analysis revealed that testosterone enhanced the pain-intensity ratings via the N1 response to the electrocutaneous stimulus. Upon viewing the predictability cues after testosterone administration, expected pain intensity increased and spontaneous low-frequency α-oscillation power in the frontal region decreased. These results provide evidence that testosterone enhanced perception and expectation of somatosensory events, and that this was a general effect rather than pain-specific. A plausible explanation for these findings is that testosterone acts to increase vigilance and sustained attention levels, as evidenced by the decreased α-oscillation power. Thus, our findings support a causal role for testosterone in heightening the biological salience of incoming somatosensory information.

Single dose testosterone administration enhances novelty responsiveness and short-term habituation in healthy males.	DOI: 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2021.104963	The role of testosterone in sensory perception suggests that testosterone likely regulates adaptive responses to sensory changes, including habituation to repeated events and responsiveness to novel events. To test this hypothesis, we investigated how testosterone modulates brain responses to rapid changes in sensory inputs. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-participant design, each participant received a single dose of either testosterone or placebo, and then completed a passive auditory oddball task in which infrequent deviant tones were embedded in a series of frequent standard tones. Analysis of novelty-evoked potentials revealed smaller Mismatch Negativity (MMN) responses, but larger P3a responses in the testosterone session than in the placebo session. This suggests testosterone attenuates MMN responses that are associated with pre-attentive novelty detection and enhances P3a responses that are associated with involuntary attentional orientation toward novelty. Along with the repetition of standard tones, P2 responses on the auditory evoked potentials became significantly attenuated in the testosterone session, but not in the placebo session. This suggests testosterone enhances short-term habituation of P2 responses to recurring sensory events, which has been associated with bottom-up attention allocation. Mediation analysis further revealed that the role of testosterone in promoting attentional orientation toward novelty could be explained by the influence it exerts on short-term habituation and pre-attentive novelty detection. Overall, testosterone facilitated involuntary attention switching-withdrawal of attention from repeated sensory events and orientation toward novel sensory events-at the cost of attenuated pre-attentive novelty detection. This finding provides insight into the interplay between endocrinology and involuntary attentional processes.

Progesterone modulates theta oscillations in the frontal-parietal network.	DOI: 10.1111/psyp.13632	The neuroactive metabolites of the steroid hormones progesterone (P4) and testosterone (T) are GABAergic modulators that influence cognition, yet, the specific effect of P4 and T on brain network activity remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated if a fundamental oscillatory network activity pattern, often related to cognitive control, frontal midline theta (FMT) oscillations, are modulated by steroids hormones, P4 and T. We measured the concentration of P4 and T using salivary enzyme immunoassay and FMT oscillations using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during eyes-open resting-state in 55 healthy women and men. Electrical brain activity was analyzed using Fourier analysis, aperiodic signal fitting, and beamformer source localization. Steroid hormone concentrations and biological sex were used as predictors for scalp and source-estimated amplitude of theta oscillations. Elevated concentrations of P4 predicted increased amplitude of FMT oscillations across both sexes, and no relationship was found with T. The positive correlation with P4 was specific to the frontal midline electrodes and survived correction for the background aperiodic signal of the brain. Using source localization, FMT oscillations were localized to the frontal-parietal network (FPN). Additionally, theta amplitude within the FPN, but not the default mode network, positively correlated with P4 concentration. Our results suggest that P4 concentration modulates brain activity via upregulation of theta oscillations in the FPN.

Single dose testosterone administration modulates the temporal dynamics of distractor processing.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104838	Some evidence suggests that testosterone can increase attentional orientation toward biologically relevant stimuli and increase sustained attention during goal-oriented behaviors. While rare irregular distractors often capture attention involuntarily and distract us away from the task at hand, we hypothesized that testosterone might (1) facilitate attentional orientation to novel distractors that are of potential behavioral relevance and (2) inhibit information processing of distractors that are irrelevant to the task. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of testosterone on distractor processing in a novelty oddball task, during which infrequent target and distractor sounds were interspersed within a series of frequent non-target sounds. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-participant design, we administered a single dose of either testosterone or placebo to 34 healthy male volunteers and compared their electroencephalographic responses to distractors. Increased amplitude of the early (260-310 ms) P3 component-which has been associated with phasic arousal and alertness triggered by novel stimuli-was observed in the testosterone session than in the placebo session. This early-P3 response mediated the effect of testosterone administration on target hit rate during the task. In addition, less α-oscillation suppression-which has been associated with the inhibition of task-irrelevant information processing-was observed in response to distractors later (538-757 ms) in the testosterone session than in the placebo session. These results suggest that testosterone facilitated phasic arousal to novel distractors during the early-latency stage, which might have influenced behavioral performance during the task. Furthermore, testosterone inhibited task-irrelevant information processing during the late-latency stage, which allowed better reorientation of attention back to the primary task. Our findings highlight the role of testosterone in distractor processing, and provide a theoretical basis for treating attention-related behavioral disorders with hormone therapies.

Oxytocin Modulates Semantic Integration in Speech Comprehension.	DOI: 10.1162/jocn_a_01044	Listeners interpret utterances by integrating information from multiple sources including word level semantics and world knowledge. When the semantics of an expression is inconsistent with their knowledge about the world, the listener may have to search through the conceptual space for alternative possible world scenarios that can make the expression more acceptable. Such cognitive exploration requires considerable computational resources and might depend on motivational factors. This study explores whether and how oxytocin, a neuropeptide known to influence social motivation by reducing social anxiety and enhancing affiliative tendencies, can modulate the integration of world knowledge and sentence meanings. The study used a between-participant double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design. Semantic integration, indexed with magnetoencephalography through the N400m marker, was quantified while 45 healthy male participants listened to sentences that were either congruent or incongruent with facts of the world, after receiving intranasally delivered oxytocin or placebo. Compared with congruent sentences, world knowledge incongruent sentences elicited a stronger N400m signal from the left inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions and medial pFC (the N400m effect) in the placebo group. Oxytocin administration significantly attenuated the N400m effect at both sensor and cortical source levels throughout the experiment, in a state-like manner. Additional electrophysiological markers suggest that the absence of the N400m effect in the oxytocin group is unlikely due to the lack of early sensory or semantic processing or a general downregulation of attention. These findings suggest that oxytocin drives listeners to resolve challenges of semantic integration, possibly by promoting the cognitive exploration of alternative possible world scenarios.

Neuroendocrinal study of depression in male epileptic patients.	DOI: 10.1176/jnp.23.2.jnp163	Endocrine changes are reported in both epilepsy and depression. The interrelationships between mood, epilepsy, and endocrine changes are not well characterized. The authors included 40 epileptic patients (20 depressed, 20 nondepressed) and 20 healthy subjects. All patients had an electroencephalogram, and were given the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. All subjects were tested for serum levels of cortisol, prolactin, testosterone, and thyroid hormones. Patients were medication-free. Patients had elevated prolactin and cortisol and reduced serum testosterone relative to control subjects. Depressed patients had higher cortisol levels than nondepressed. Data suggest that the effects of epilepsy and depression on cortisol, but not other hormones, may be additive.

Frontal brain oscillatory coupling among men who vary in salivary testosterone levels.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.08.059	Recent studies suggest that cross-frequency coupling supports the integration of distinct neuronal oscillatory modes. In particular, spectral coupling between slow-wave delta and fast-wave beta oscillations may reflect subcortical-cortical interactions. Prior experiments have shown that delta-beta coupling appears to be sensitive to steroid hormone patterning. We attempted to extend this hypothesis by examining the relation between delta-beta EEG spectral coupling and endogenous testosterone measures in men. We collected resting regional brain electrical (EEG) activity and salivary testosterone from 34 healthy young adult males (M age=24 years). Males with high testosterone showed non-significant delta-beta coupling (delta-beta decoupling), while males with low testosterone exhibited significant delta-beta coupling. These relations were only found for the frontal brain region. There was also a significant group difference in the magnitude of coupling, but no differences in absolute delta and beta power. Findings are discussed in terms of emerging evidence relating steroid hormones to cross-frequency spectral coupling and directions for future work.

Administration of testosterone increases functional connectivity in a cortico-cortical depression circuit.	DOI: 10.1176/jnp.17.3.372	Increasing evidence suggests that the steroid hormone testosterone (T) enhances libido and decreases depression. Even a single administration of T (0.5 mg sublingually) in healthy young women is sufficient to enhance physiological sexual responsiveness. Such physiological evidence is not yet available for the link between T and depression. Recent research has revealed that lowered functional connectivity in a specific cortico-cortical pathway may be a sensitive physiological index for depression. This pathway, comprised of the left prefrontal and right parietal cortex, has been named a cortical depression circuit. In the present study, a single dose of T was administered to healthy young women to investigate the effects on the functional connectivity in this cortico-cortical depression circuit. It was hypothesized that administration of T would lead to an increase of functional connectivity. In a double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover design, fourteen healthy females received (sublingually) a single dose of 0.5 mg T or placebo in a randomly assigned fashion. Three hours after drug administration the functional coupling between the left prefrontal and right parietal cortex was established by measuring the interhemispheric electroencephalogram (EEG) coherence for the different frequency bands. Compared to placebo, T administration significantly increased the functional connectivity in the sigma (1-3 Hz) frequency range between the left prefrontal and right parietal cortex. Reductions in interhemispheric coherence in the sigma frequency range have been observed in clinically depressed patients. Thus the present findings may provide a first insight into the neurobiological mechanism by which T decreases depression. The fact that only a single dose of T was able to induce the effect in healthy female subjects suggests that the mechanism is highly sensitive. A feasible application of T treatment in the struggle against depression is discussed.

Acute influences of estrogen and testosterone on divergent and convergent thinking in postmenopausal women.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1300200	"Previous studies indicated an enhanced capability of divergent creative thinking in young women during the ovulatory phase, which expressed itself also by an increased dimensional complexity of ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Considering the enhanced plasma levels of estrogen and testosterone characterizing the ovulatory phase, we tested whether short-term administration of estrogen or testosterone in postmenopausal women with constantly low levels of gonadal steroids induces similar changes in divergent thinking. In two placebo-controlled cross-over studies, healthy postmenopausal women (n=12, in each study, mean age 58 years, range 47-65 years) were treated transdermally over 3 days with estrogen and testosterone, respectively, at doses inducing plasma hormone concentrations comparable with those observed in young women around ovulation. Capabilities of divergent thought and convergent analytical thought, performance on motor perseveration, and verbal memory were examined. EEG activity was recorded while subjects performed on tasks of thinking and during mental relaxation. Estrogen impaired divergent thinking (p <0.01) and enhanced convergent thinking, motor perseveration, and memory for the initial word list (p <0.05 for all tests). In parallel, EEG dimensional complexity was reduced (p <0.05). Overall, these changes indicate an estrogen-induced shift from a ""divergent"" towards a more ""convergent"" mode of processing. However, overall less consistent, effects of testosterone were opposite to those of estrogen. It increased performance on some of the divergent thinking tasks (p <0.05), and tended to increase EEG dimensional complexity during divergent thinking. Data indicate a differential sensitivity of modes of thinking to short-term treatment with estrogen and testosterone in postmenopausal women."

Older men manifest multifold synchrony disruption of reproductive neurohormone outflow.	DOI: 10.1210/jcem.85.4.6546	Under a working clinical hypothesis that aging putatively disrupts neuroendocrine control mechanisms, here we test a specific corollary notion that transitions in sleep stage, oscillations in nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT; a neurogenically organized signal), and the rates of instantaneous secretion of LH and/or testosterone are jointly synchronous in healthy young, but not older, men. To this end, we evaluated 10 young (aged 21-31 yr) and 8 older (aged 65-74 yr) men by intensive overnight multisite monitoring, viz. simultaneous electro-encephalogram and NPT recordings (every 30 s) and remote blood sampling (every 2.5 min) to quantitate LH and testosterone release. Waveform-independent deconvolution and cross-correlation analyses of these neurohormone outflow measures revealed that healthy young men sustain four salient physiological linkages overnight: 1) a strong inverse (confirmatory) relationship between sleep stage and NPT activity, such that deeper sleep is accompanied by suppression of NPT; 2) consistent coupling between NPT and testosterone secretion, wherein heightened NPT activity respectively precedes and follows increased testosterone secretion by 12.5-32.5 and 50-60 min; 3) evident synchrony between sleep stage and testosterone secretion, in which testosterone secretion increases over a 30-min window (-2.5 to 25 min) while sleep deepens; and 4) a close temporal linkage between instantaneous LH release and NPT oscillations, whereby LH secretion increases 55-62.5 min before and again 5-30 min after NPT declines. In contrast, older men manifested global loss of expected young adult synchrony; namely, 1) abolition of the inverse relationship between sleep stage and NPT, 2) decorrelation of NPT oscillations and testosterone secretion, 3) decoupling of testosterone release and deep sleep, and 4) abrogation of the linkage between LH secretion and penile detumescence. In summary, high intensity overnight monitoring of multiple reproductive neuroendocrine outflow measures simultaneously in young men delineates prominent neurophysiological coupling among sleep transitions and NPT activity, LH and testosterone secretion or NPT oscillations, and testosterone secretion and deepening sleep stage. In contrast, healthy older men exhibit near-universal disruption of physiological young adult synchronicity. Thus, we conclude that male reproductive aging is marked by erosion of coordinate regulation among sleep transitions, central nervous system-directed NPT activity, and hypothalamically driven episodic GnRH/LH (and thereby Leydig cell testosterone) secretion. Whether analogous multifold uncoupling of neurohormone signals emerges in the course of reproductive aging in women or in nonhuman species is not yet known.

DHEA administration increases rapid eye movement sleep and EEG power in the sigma frequency range.	DOI: 10.1152/ajpendo.1995.268.1.E107	Dehydroepi-androsterone (DHEA) exhibits various behavioral effects in mammals, at least one of which is enhancement of memory that appears to be mediated by an interaction with the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor complex. We investigated the effects of a single oral dose of DHEA (500 mg) on sleep stages, sleep stage-specific electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra, and concurrent hormone secretion in 10 healthy young men. DHEA administration induced a significant (P < 0.05) increase in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas all other sleep variables remained unchanged compared with the placebo condition. Spectral analysis of five selected EEG bands revealed significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced EEG activity in the sigma frequency range during REM sleep in the first 2-h sleep period after DHEA administration. In contrast, the EEG power spectra of non-REM sleep were not affected, nor were the nocturnal time course curves of plasma cortisol, growth hormone, or testosterone concentration. The results suggest that DHEA administration has a mixed GABAA-agonistic/antagonistic effect, exerted either directly or through DHEA-induced changes in steroid metabolism. Because REM sleep has been implicated in memory storage, its augmentation in the present study suggests the potential clinical usefulness of DHEA in age-related dementia.

Dietary boron, brain function, and cognitive performance.	DOI: 10.1289/ehp.94102s765	Although the trace element boron has yet to be recognized as an essential nutrient for humans, recent data from animal and human studies suggest that boron may be important for mineral metabolism and membrane function. To investigate further the functional role of boron, brain electrophysiology and cognitive performance were assessed in response to dietary manipulation of boron (approximately 0.25 versus approximately 3.25 mg boron/2000 kcal/day) in three studies with healthy older men and women. Within-subject designs were used to assess functional responses in all studies. Spectral analysis of electroencephalographic data showed effects of dietary boron in two of the three studies. When the low boron intake was compared to the high intake, there was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the proportion of low-frequency activity, and a decrease in the proportion of higher-frequency activity, an effect often observed in response to general malnutrition and heavy metal toxicity. Performance (e.g., response time) on various cognitive and psychomotor tasks also showed an effect of dietary boron. When contrasted with the high boron intake, low dietary boron resulted in significantly poorer performance (p < 0.05) on tasks emphasizing manual dexterity (studies II and III); eye-hand coordination (study II); attention (all studies); perception (study III); encoding and short-term memory (all studies); and long-term memory (study I). Collectively, the data from these three studies indicate that boron may play a role in human brain function and cognitive performance, and provide additional evidence that boron is an essential nutrient for humans.

Differential effects of dopaminergic drugs on anxiety and arousal in healthy volunteers with high and low anxiety.	DOI: 10.1016/s0278-5846(97)00033-x	1. The appearance of frontal midline theta activity (Fm theta), the distinct EEG theta rhythm in the frontal midline area during performance of a mental task, indicates relief from anxiety in humans. 2. The authors examined the effects of bromocriptine and sulpiride on anxiety and arousal in 24 male university students with (Fm theta group, n = 12) and without (non-Fm theta group, n = 12) Fm theta. Subjects were given placebo, 2.5 mg bromocriptine and 100 mg sulpiride in a double-blind crossover design. 3. Blood samples were obtained, STAI scores were determined, and EEGs were recorded before and during the performance of an arithmetic addition task. The test was repeated twice: before and 1 hr after drug administration. 4. Bromocriptine reduced the HVA concentration in both groups; sulpiride caused an increase in both groups. In the Fm theta group, bromocriptine did not alter the appearance time of Fm theta, the state anxiety score or the task performance; sulpiride increased the Fm theta amount and reduced the state anxiety but did not affect the task performance. In the non-Fm theta group, bromocriptine increased the Fm theta duration and reduced the state anxiety score but did not influence the task performance, while sulpiride reduced Fm theta and increased the state anxiety but had no effect on the task performance. 5. These results suggest that the sensitivity of presynaptic D2 receptors is higher in high-anxiety subjects compared with low-anxiety subjects, and that anxiolytic effects in high-anxiety humans and those in low-anxiety humans may be caused by decreased and increased DA activity, respectively. In addition, the stimulation of DA function may cause anxiogenic effects in high-anxiety individuals.

No effects of l-dopa and bromocriptine on psychophysiological parameters of human selective attention.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881106061712	Patients with schizophrenia exhibit diverse cognitive deficits, one of which is a loss of the ability to focus attention. According to the revised dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia both an increased mesolimbic and a decreased prefrontal dopaminergic activity is suggested to be involved in schizophrenia. The current study was designed to explore the relationship between dopamine and two psychophysiological parameters of selective attention, i.e. P300 amplitude and processing negativity (PN) in healthy volunteers. In two separate experiments, with a double-blind, balanced and placebo-controlled crossover design, 18 healthy male volunteers were orally administered either 300 mg l-dopa (precursor of dopamine) or placebo (experiment I), or 1.25mg bromocriptine (D2 agonist) or placebo (experiment II). Following this treatment they were tested in an auditory, dichotic selective attention paradigm. An increase in P300 amplitude was found following deviant stimuli when compared to standard stimuli and following attended stimuli when compared to unattended stimuli, regardless of treatment. Similarly, PN was found regardless of treatment. Neither l-dopa nor bromocriptine affected task performance or the amplitudes of PN or P300. In the present study neither l-dopa nor bromocriptine affected PN, P300 amplitude or task performance in healthy controls, phenomena which are usually found to be disrupted in schizophrenia. This indicates that P300 amplitude and PN are neither affected by a global (l-dopa) increased dopaminergic activity, nor by a more selectively towards striatal areas targeted (bromocriptine) increase in dopaminergic activity.

Increasing dopaminergic activity: effects of L-dopa and bromocriptine on human sensory gating.	DOI: 10.1177/026988110401800310	Schizophrenic patients show a loss of sensory gating, which is reflected in a reduced P50 suppression. Because most of the symptoms in schizophrenia can be reduced by antagonists of the dopaminergic (D2) system, the loss in sensory gating might be related to an increased dopaminergic activity. Therefore, in the present study, the effects of increased dopaminergic neurotransmisson on sensory gating in healthy volunteers were investigated. In a double-blind, balanced, placebo-controlled design, healthy male volunteers were challenged in two separate studies with either 300 mg L-dopa (precursor of dopamine) or placebo (n=16) and 1.25 mg bromocriptine (D2 agonist) or placebo (n=17). Subsequently, they were tested for their sensory gating (P50 suppression). P50 suppression values in the placebo condition were comparable to those found in literature. Although both L-dopa and bromocriptine reduced P50 amplitude, they did so in an equal ratio for both the response to the conditioning (C) and the testing (T) stimuli, therefore not resulting in a reduction of the P50 suppression ratio (T/C). In the present study, neither L-dopa nor bromocriptine reduced sensory gating in healthy volunteers. This suggests that an increased dopaminergic activity in humans is not responsible for the reduction in sensory gating as seen, for example, in schizophrenia.

Different biochemical correlates for different neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis.	DOI: 10.1002/hep.24043	The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) relies on clinical, neurophysiological, psychometric and laboratory variables. The relationships between such tests remain debated. The aim of this study was to determine the laboratory correlates/prognostic value of neurophysiological/psychometric abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis. Seventy-two patients and 14 healthy volunteers underwent EEG and paper-and-pencil psychometry (PHES). Blood was obtained for C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, ammonia and indole/oxindole. Patients were followed prospectively for a median of 22 months in relation to the occurrence of death, transplantation and HE-related hospitalizations. Thirty-three patients had normal PHES and EEG, 6 had abnormal PHES, 18 abnormal EEG and 13 abnormal PHES and EEG. Patients with abnormal PHES had higher CRP (17 ± 22 vs 7 ± 6, P < 0.01), IL6 (32 ± 54 vs 12 ± 13, P < 0.05) and TNFα (17 ± 8 vs 11 ± 7, P < 0.001) levels than those with normal PHES. Patients with abnormal EEG had higher indole (430 ± 270 vs 258 ± 255, P < 0.01) and ammonia (66 ± 35 vs 45 ± 27, P < 0.05) levels than those with normal EEG. Psychometric test scores showed significant correlations with CRP, TNFα and IL6; EEG indices with ammonia and IL6. CRP and TNFα concentrations were independent predictors of abnormal PHES, ammonia and indole of abnormal EEG on multivariate analysis. Seven patients were lost to follow-up; of the remaining 65, 20 died and 14 underwent transplantation; 15 developed HE requiring hospitalization. PHES and EEG performance were independent predictors of HE and death (P < 0.05).

EEG topography and tomography (LORETA) in diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of depression.	DOI: 10.1177/155005941004100407	Earlier investigations suggested an involvement of the right hemisphere and the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the pathogenesis of depression. This paper presents our own electroencephalographic (EEG) topography and low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) data obtained in unmedicated depressed patients, and the effects of two representative drugs of non-sedative and sedative antidepressants, i.e., citalopram (CIT) and imipramine (IMI), as compared with placebo in normal subjects. Sixty female menopausal syndrome patients with the diagnosis of a depressive episode without psychotic symptoms as well as 30 healthy controls were investigated. Concerning the effects of antidepressants, normal healthy subjects received single oral doses of 20 mg CIT, 75 mg IMI and placebo p.o. A 3-min vigilance-controlled EEG and a 4-min resting EEG was recorded pre- and post-drug administration and analyzed by means of EEG mapping and LORETA. In the EEG mapping, depressed patients demonstrated a decrease in absolute power in all frequency bands, an augmentation of relative delta/theta and beta and a decrease in alpha activity as well as a slowing of the delta/theta centroid and an acceleration of the alpha and beta centroid, which suggests vigilance decrements. In the alpha asymmetry index, they showed right frontal hyper- and left frontal hypoactivation correlated with the Hamilton Depression Score (HAMD). LORETA predominantly revealed decreased power in the theta and alpha-1 frequency band. Negative correlations between theta power and the HAMD were observed in the ventro-medial PFC, the bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the left insular cortex; between alpha-1 power and the HAMD in the right PFC. In the EEG mapping of antidepressants, 20 mg CIT showed mainly activating, 75 mg IMI partly sedative properties. LORETA revealed that CIT increased alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2 and beta-3 power more over the right than over the left hemisphere. However, also a left temporal and frontal delta increase was observed. In conclusion, EEG topography and tomography of depressed menopausal patients demonstrated a right frontal hyper- and left frontal hypoactivation in the alpha asymmetry index as well as a vigilance decrease, with a right-hemispheric preponderance. Within antidepressants at least 2 subtypes may be distinguished from the electrophysiological point of view, a non-sedative and a sedative. LORETA identifies cerebral generators responsible for the pathogenesis of depression as well as for the mode of action of antidepressants.

The effects of imipramine on P50 suppression, prepulse inhibition and habituation of the startle response in humans.	DOI: 10.1017/S1461145706007504	Schizophrenic patients exhibit impairments in filtering of sensory information, as can be assessed by use of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response and P50 suppression paradigms. In the treatment of negative symptoms or depressive syndromes during the course of schizophrenia antidepressants are often combined with antipsychotic medication. However, antidepressants increase monoaminergic activity, which has been suggested to decrease sensory gating, although these presumptions are mostly based on results from animal studies. Currently, little is known about monoaminergic modulation of sensory filtering in humans, and the few reports that can be found in literature show discrepancies with animal studies. The current study was designed to study the effects of increased monoaminergic activity on sensory filtering and habituation of healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design, 20 healthy male volunteers received either placebo or a dose of 50 mg imipramine (a dual-acting antidepressant), after which they were tested in a P50 suppression paradigm, a PPI paradigm, and an habituation of the startle reflex paradigm. Imipramine significantly decreased PPI as well as P50 suppression. No significant differences between the two treatments were observed on habituation of the acoustic startle reflex. Since sensory filtering is usually already reduced in patients with schizophrenia, the current results call for caution in the widespread use of dual-acting antidepressants in the treatment of depressed or negative symptoms in these patients.

Growth hormone secretion timing in depression: clinical outcome comparisons.	DOI: 10.1016/0006-3223(95)00068-2	Growth hormone (GH) secretion in the 100 minutes preceding sleep onset (preSO), as well as in the first half of the night (1st HN), was examined for a group of 13 healthy women and 43 women with recurrent depression who participated in a 3-year maintenance therapy study. GH studies were obtained at several points during treatment and every 3 months during maintenance, during which patients were randomly assigned to active drug or drug-free maintenance treatment cells for 3 years, or until recurrence of depression. Depressed patients were divided into subgroups according to their maintenance treatment assignment (active drug or drug free) and treatment outcome (completing in remission or having a recurrence). Imipramine caused an increase in the GH ratio in all subgroups. Protocol completers had a significantly larger imipramine-induced increase in the GH ratio than did recurrers. The difference in time of GH secretion relative to sleep onset was found to correlate with treatment outcome and was independent of medication status during maintenance.

Sleep-related growth hormone secretion is persistently suppressed in women with recurrent depression: a preliminary longitudinal analysis.	DOI: 10.1016/0022-3956(94)90007-8	Growth hormone secretion was monitored during sleep in a group of 43 women with recurrent major depression who were participating in a 3-year maintenance therapy program. Patients were studied before acute treatment, after complete remission, and at 3-month intervals during maintenance treatment and the data generated were compared to those obtained in a control group of 14 age-matched healthy women studied once under identical conditions. When compared to the control group, the depressed patients secreted significantly less growth hormone before treatment. This reduction in growth hormone secretion, which was confined to the first half of the sleep period, persisted across the length of the maintenance study regardless of whether the subjects completed three years of therapy or experienced a recurrence.

Pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine evaluated by EEG brain mapping, psychometry and psychophysiology.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1992.tb04087.x	1. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study the effects of venlafaxine--a novel nontricyclic compound inhibiting neuronal uptake of serotonin, noradrenaline and to a lesser extent dopamine--were investigated utilizing EEG brain mapping, psychometric and psychophysiological measures. 2. Sixteen healthy volunteers (eight males, eight females) aged 21-36 years received randomized and at weekly intervals single oral doses of placebo, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg venlafaxine. EEG recordings, psychometric and psychophysiological tests, and evaluation of pulse, blood pressure and side-effects were carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. 3. EEG brain mapping demonstrated that venlafaxine exerted a significant action on human brain function as compared with placebo at all three doses, characterized mostly by attenuation of absolute power, increase of relative delta/theta and beta, and decrease of alpha power, as well as by an acceleration of the total centroid fronto-temporally and by its slowing centrally and parietally. These findings are similar to antidepressants such as imipramine. Topographically, drug-induced alterations were most pronounced over both fronto-temporal and the right temporal to temporo-occipital regions. 4. Psychometric and psychophysiological investigations demonstrated significant dose-dependent psychotropic properties of the drug. Multivariate statistics exhibited an improvement of both the noopsyche (e.g. attention, concentration, attention variability, memory, fine motor activity, reaction time performance) and thymopsyche (e.g. drive, wakefulness)) but also significant psychophysiological activation (e.g. in c.f.f., pupillary and skin conductance measures). 5. Time-efficiency calculations showed significant central effects from the 2nd hour onwards, with increasing differences between placebo and treatment up to the 8th hour. Nausea was the most frequent complaint and appeared dose dependent.

Pharmaco-EEG profile of maroxepine: third example to discuss the predictive value of pharmaco-electroencephalography in early human pharmacological evaluations of psychoactive drugs.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2007-1014471	This publication forms the third part of a critical evaluation of pharmaco-EEG applications as an instrument for assessing the profile of action of psychoactive drugs based on the trial results of three new psychoactive test substances: savoxepine, levoprotiline and maroxepine. After the presentation, in Parts I (savoxepine) and II (levoprotiline), of trial substances for which compatible results were obtained in the pharmaco-EEG model and in the clinical studies, a case with discrepant and less predictive results has been presented, and on this basis the limitations of the pharmaco-EEG model in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy are discussed. The substance examined in this report, the tetracyclic dibenzoxepine derivative, maroxepine, produced prominent central effects in pharmacological studies which pointed to a bipolar profile of action, i.e., the EEG showed similarities both to antidepressants and antipsychotics. The pharmaco-EEG effects of maroxepine were investigated in a randomised, double-blind study in 15 young healthy male subjects and compared with those of placebo and the reference substances, chlorpromazine and imipramine. The experimental design was a cross-over uncompleted block design with five consecutive trial days one week apart. The pharmaco-EEG was recorded from the occipito-temporal and frontocentral regions before, 3 and 6 h after application of 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg maroxepine, 75 mg chlorpromazine, 75 mg imipramine and placebo. The selected target variables for descriptive statistical evaluation were the Spectral Difference Index (SDI), the absolute and relative power values in seven predetermined frequency bands within the range 1.5 to 30.0 Hz, the dominant frequency (6.0 to 18.0 Hz) and the alpha slow-wave index (ASI). The results show that maroxepine has a potent central nervous action and a strong sedative potential. The EEG effects consisted of a shift to the left of the relative power spectrum of the occipital lead, accompanied by an increase in the absolute beta power in the frontocentral region. Discriminative inspection of the profiles of EEG changes, induced by maroxepine and the reference drugs, revealed closer similarity of maroxepine with chlorpromazine than with imipramine. Maroxepine showed vigilance-decreasing features like imipramine. This is one condition to be able to interfere with depressive illness. The underlying hypothesis is that depressive illness is based on affective and vigilance disturbance. Maroxepine furthermore showed the typical neuroleptic-like shift from resting alpha to resting subalpha (theta F band) which we assume related to the anti-productive properties of neuroleptics in schizophrenia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Chlorpromazinepharmacology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dibenzazepinespharmacologytherapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'Humans', 'Imipraminepharmacology', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Psychomotor Performancedrug effects', 'Schizophreniadrug therapy']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1812498/	['Imipramine']	[3696]	1812498	['1991', 'Nov']
Pharmaco-EEG profile of levoprotiline: second example to discuss the predictive value of pharmaco-electroencephalography in early human pharmacological evaluations of psychoactive drugs.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2007-1014470	The present paper forms the second part of a critical evaluation of the use of pharmaco-EEG as an instrument for assessing the profile of action of psychoactive drugs in man based on the trial results of three new psychoactive test substances. Part I described the basic principles and methodological approaches and illustrated the value of pharmaco-EEG in framing hypotheses about the therapeutic efficacy of psychotropic drugs by the example of the neuroleptic drug savoxepine. This chapter illustrates the relevance of pharmaco-EEG in the assessment of psychoactive drugs by reference to the test substance levoprotiline. Levoprotiline is the pure R-(-)-enantiomer of the racemic drug oxaprotiline, a successor to the second-generation antidepressant maprotiline. Only the S-(+)-enantiomer of oxaprotiline inhibits the re-uptake of noradrenaline. In view of the absence of any monoamine-uptake inhibiting action of levoprotiline, this drug was assumed to be devoid of an antidepressive action. This assumption, however, was disproved by observations made in clinical studies with depressive patients, in whom levoprotiline did indeed display antidepressive activity. Investigations of levoprotiline in the pharmaco-EEG model--even though being retrospective in the sequence of events--would have been able to produce objective prediction of antidepressive potential in man. The substance was tested by comparison to placebo and to the standard antidepressant imipramine in nine young, healthy male volunteers. The experimental design was a cross-over uncompleted block design with three consecutive trial days one week apart.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Antidepressive Agentspharmacologytherapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'Humans', 'Imipraminepharmacology', 'Male', 'Maprotilineanalogs & derivativespharmacologytherapeutic use']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1812497/	['Imipramine', 'Norepinephrine', 'Maprotiline']	[3696, 439260, 4011]	1812497	['1991', 'Nov']
Recurrent depression is associated with a persistent reduction in sleep-related growth hormone secretion.	DOI: 10.1001/archpsyc.1990.01810140013002	Sleep onset is a powerful physiologic stimulus for growth hormone secretion. Difficulty falling asleep and poor sleep maintenance are prominent symptoms in patients with a major depressive disorder. Much of the disturbance in the sleep electroencephalograms of depressed patients occurs within the first half of the night, the time when growth hormone is usually secreted. Growth hormone secretion was measured during electroencephalographically monitored sleep in 38 patients with a recurrent major depressive disorder and 35 healthy control subjects. Before treatment, depressed patients had a statistically significant reduction in growth hormone secretion during sleep. This reduction, which persisted through treatment and recovery into the drug-free remitted state, may be a trait marker in patients with a recurrent depressive disorder.

An ERP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) exploits this neural mechanism for communication. Hitherto, it was unclear to what extent the accuracy of such a BCI requires eye movements (overt attention) or whether it is also feasible for targets in the visual periphery (covert attention). Also unclear was how the visual design of the BCI can be improved to meet peculiarities of peripheral vision such as low spatial acuity and crowding.

Cholinergic REM induction test with arecoline in depressed children.	DOI: 10.1016/0165-1781(94)90014-0	Children with major depressive disorder often fail to exhibit electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep abnormalities similar to those reported in depressed adults. It was hypothesized that a cholinergic rapid eye movement (REM) induction test would contribute to the identification of EEG sleep abnormalities in depressed children. To test this hypothesis, prepubertal children meeting research diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (n = 33) and carefully screened healthy control children (n = 15) were enrolled in a 4-day psychobiologic protocol that included 1 night with infusion of arecoline (0.5 mg) during the first non-REM sleep period. Although there had been no significant group differences in baseline sleep measures, results on the arecoline night revealed significantly shorter REM latency in the group of depressed children compared with the control children (mean +/- SD = 105 +/- 51 minutes vs. 140 +/- 46 minutes). The design of the protocol (with an interval break immediately preceding the arecoline night) prevented a direct estimation of arecoline effects within subjects; however, these data provide promising preliminary results regarding cholinergic REM induction tests in childhood depression.

Pharmacodynamic effects of two different hypericum extracts in healthy volunteers measured by quantitative EEG.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2007-979345	A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial (phase I) was performed to evaluate the central pharmacodynamic effects of two hypericum extracts with different contents of hyperforin (0.5% and 5.0%) but identical hypericin content. Three groups of 18 volunteers between 18 and 35 years of age participated in the trial. The volunteers receiving verum took 900 mg of the extract once a day for 8 consecutive days. The primary aim of this study was to observe the frequency bands, i.e., delta (1.25-4.5 Hz), theta (4.75-6.75 Hz), alpha-1 (7.0-9.5 Hz), alpha-2 (9.75-12.5 Hz), beta-1 (12.75-18.5 Hz), and beta-2 (18.75-35 Hz). This was the first study of its kind testing hypericum controlled on the basis of its hyperforin contents. A quantitative topographic EEG (qEEG) was performed on days 1 and 8 as an indicator of drug-induced pharmacological action. The volunteers' electrophysiological data were obtained prior to application and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours post administration. Plasma samples for evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of hyperforin were also obtained. The qEEG results of the placebo group on days 1 and 8 showed no significant changes with regard to their physiological daily rhythm. In both verum groups (0.5% and 5.0% hyperforin content), reproducible central pharmacodynamic effects were apparent in comparison to placebo, in particular with the extract containing 5.0% of hyperforin. A peak pharmacodynamic efficacy was observed between 4 and 8 hours post administration. These results were confirmed on day 8 of the trial. The extract containing 5.0% hyperforin showed a marked tendency to produce higher increases in qEEG baseline power performances than the one containing 0.5% hyperforin. These higher baseline outputs on day 8 were seen at the delta, theta, and alpha-1 frequency values. Compared to placebo there was a significant increase in qEEG power performance in the delta and beta-1 frequency values exclusively for the extract containing 5.0% hyperforin. The theta and alpha-1 frequency values showed a noticeable tendency more emphasized on day 8 than on day 1. Preclinical trials in rats have been observed with similar changes in the frequency bands mentioned above, especially in the cholinergic (delta), noradrenergic (theta) and serotonergic (alpha) neurotransmitter systems. These experimental findings suggest that hypericum extracts with a high hyperforin content have a shielding effect on the central nervous system.

Psychomotor and cognitive effects of piribedil, a dopamine agonist, in young healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1472-8206.2002.00070.x	Piribedil is a dopamine agonist acting on D2 and D3 central nervous system dopamine receptors. This drug has been administered to 12 young healthy male volunteers (age 22 +/- 2 years) according to a single center randomized, double-blind, two ways cross-over, placebo controlled trial, including a washout period of one week. Placebo and piribedil were administered by a single intravenous infusion over 2 h (3 mg). Psychomotor performance and cognitive functions were assessed through a standardized and computerized psychometric tests battery and a continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) mapping. Piribedil improved simple reaction time (P=0.02), immediate (P=0.045 and 0.004), and delayed free recall (P=0.05), dual coding test (P=0.02) and increased theta and fast beta waves on the EEG (P < 0.05 and 0.001, respectively). No deleterious effect was observed on the tests exploring attention and concentration via the other procedures. It is concluded that a single intravenous perfusion of piribedil 3 mg improves alertness and the information processing speed within the central nervous system, in healthy volunteers.

Duration of activity and mode of action of modafinil: Studies on sleep and wakefulness in humans.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881113508173	The duration of activity of modafinil was investigated in healthy male volunteers in two double-blind crossover studies. Mode of action was explored using a statistical model concerned with the relationship between total sleep duration and that of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Nocturnal sleep (23:00-07:00) followed by next-day performance (09:00-17:00) was studied in 12 subjects administered 100, 200, 300 mg modafinil and placebo, 0.5 h before bedtime. Performance overnight (19:00-08:45) followed by sleep (09:15-15:15) was studied in nine subjects administered 100, 200, 300, 400 mg modafinil, 300 mg caffeine and placebo at 22:15. Modafinil dose-dependently reduced sleep duration (nocturnal: 200 mg, p<0.05; 300 mg, p<0.001; morning: 300 and 400 mg, p<0.05) and REM sleep (nocturnal: 300 mg; morning: 400 mg; p<0.05). The statistical model revealed that reduced REM sleep was due to alerting activity, with no evidence of direct suppression of REM sleep, suggesting dopaminergic activity. Enhanced performance with modafinil during overnight work varied with dose (200 mg>100 mg; 300, 400 mg>200, 100 mg, caffeine). However, in the study of next-day performance, the enhancement was attenuated at the highest dose (300 mg) by the greater disturbance of prior sleep. These findings indicate that modafinil has a long duration of action, with alerting properties arising predominantly from dopaminergic activity.

Electroencephalogram effects of armodafinil: comparison with behavioral alertness.	DOI: 10.1002/jcph.143	Development of central nervous system-acting drugs would be enhanced by suitable biomarkers that reflect the targeted pathophysiologic brain state. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has several characteristics of an ideal biomarker and can be promptly adapted to pre-clinical and clinical testing. The aim of this study was to evaluate EEG as a measure of the wakefulness-promoting effect of armodafinil in sleep deprived healthy subjects. Armodafinil pharmacodynamics were simultaneously assessed by EEG- and behavioral-based measures including a well-established measure of alertness. Using two quantitative EEG-based measures-power spectral and event-related brain activity analyses-we observed that armodafinil mitigated the slowing of brain activity and the decrease of the event-related brain activity caused by sleep deprivation. Armodafinil-induced changes in EEG are in agreement and explain up to 73.1% of the armodafinil-induced changes in alertness. Our findings suggest that EEG can serve as a marker of the wakefulness-promoting drug effect.

Effects of modafinil on the sleep EEG depend on Val158Met genotype of COMT.	DOI: 10.1093/sleep/33.8.1027	Modafinil may promote wakefulness by increasing cerebral dopaminergic neurotransmission, which importantly depends on activity of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in prefrontal cortex. The effects of modafinil on sleep homeostasis in humans are unknown.

Orexin 2 receptor-selective agonist danavorexton (TAK-925) promotes wakefulness in non-human primates and healthy individuals.	DOI: 10.1111/jsr.13878	The orexin 2 receptor-selective agonist danavorexton (TAK-925) has been shown to produce wake-promoting effects in wild-type mice, narcolepsy-model mice, and individuals with narcolepsy type 1 and type 2. Here, we report wake-promoting effects of danavorexton in non-human primates and healthy men during their sleep phase. Electroencephalogram analyses revealed that subcutaneous administration of danavorexton significantly increased wakefulness in common marmosets (p < 0.05 at 0.1 mg kg-1 , and p < 0.001 at 1 mg kg-1 and 10 mg kg-1 ) and cynomolgus monkeys (p ≤ 0.05 at 1 mg kg-1 and 3 mg kg-1 ). In a phase 1b crossover, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled study in sleep-deprived healthy participants (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03522506), modafinil 300 mg (used to demonstrate assay sensitivity) and continuous infusion of danavorexton 44 mg and danavorexton 112 mg showed statistically superior wake-promoting effects to placebo (n = 18). Measured using the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, mean (standard deviation) sleep latencies during infusion of danavorexton 44 mg, danavorexton 112 mg and placebo were 21.4 (8.9), 31.8 (3.2) and 9.2 (6.4) min, respectively. Least-squares mean difference from placebo in average sleep latency was 16.8 min with danavorexton 44 mg and 30.2 min with danavorexton 112 mg (both p < 0.001). Karolinska Sleepiness Scale scores were statistically significantly lower (indicating decreased sleepiness) for participants receiving danavorexton than for those receiving placebo during infusion (danavorexton 44 mg, p = 0.010; danavorexton 112 mg, p < 0.001). Together, these results indicate that an orexin 2 receptor agonist increases wakefulness in non-human primates and healthy individuals during their sleep phase.

Modafinil augments oscillatory power in middle frequencies during rule selection.	DOI: 10.1111/psyp.12201	Control-related cognitive processes are associated with cortical oscillations and modulated by catecholamine neurotransmitters. It remains unclear how catecholamine systems modulate control-related oscillations. We tested modafinil effects on rule-related 4-30 Hz oscillations, with double-blind, placebo-controlled (within-subjects) testing of 22 healthy adults, using EEG during cognitive control task performance. EEG data underwent time-frequency decomposition with Morlet wavelets to determine power of 4-30 Hz oscillations. Modafinil enhanced oscillatory power associated with high-control rule selection in theta, alpha, and beta ranges, with a frontotemporal topography and minimal effects during rule maintenance. Augmentation of catecholamine signaling enhances middle-frequency cortical oscillatory power associated with rule selection, which may subserve diverse subcomponent processes in proactive cognitive control.

The functional Val158Met polymorphism of COMT predicts interindividual differences in brain alpha oscillations in young men.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1427-09.2009	Individual patterns of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in wakefulness and sleep are among the most heritable traits in humans, yet distinct genetic and neurochemical mechanisms underlying EEG phenotypes are largely unknown. A functional polymorphism in the gene encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme playing an important role in cortical dopamine metabolism, causes a common substitution of methionine (Met) for valine (Val) at codon 158 of COMT protein. Val allele homozygotes exhibit higher COMT activity and lower dopaminergic signaling in prefrontal cortex than Met/Met homozygotes. Evidence suggests that this polymorphism affects executive functions in healthy individuals. We hypothesized that it also modulates functional aspects of EEG in wakefulness and sleep. EEG recordings were conducted twice on separate occasions in 10 Val/Val and 12 Met/Met allele carriers (all men) in wakefulness, and in baseline and recovery sleep before and after 40 h prolonged waking. During sleep deprivation, subjects received placebo and modafinil in randomized, cross-over manner. We show that the Val158Met polymorphism predicts stable and frequency-specific, interindividual variation in brain alpha oscillations. Alpha peak frequency in wakefulness was 1.4 Hz slower in Val/Val genotype than in Met/Met genotype. Moreover, Val/Val allele carriers exhibited less 11-13 Hz activity than Met/Met homozygotes in wakefulness, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep. This difference was resistant against the effects of sleep deprivation and modafinil. The data demonstrate that mechanisms involving COMT contribute to interindividual differences in brain alpha oscillations, which are functionally related to executive performance such as counting tendency on a random number generation task in young adults.

Modafinil ameliorates the decline in pronunciation-related working memory caused by 36-h acute total sleep deprivation: An ERP study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nlm.2022.107625	We aimed to explore whether modafinil mitigates the working memory decline induced by 36 h of acute total sleep deprivation (36-h TSD). Sixteen healthy male participants were enrolled in a randomized double-blind crossover control study involving three sleep-deprivation sessions. Participants were administered 400 mg of placebo, caffeine, or modafinil during these sessions. Behavior and EEG data were recorded while participants performed pronunciation-related working memory tasks. Behavioral indicators showed that, compared with placebo, modafinil improved the accuracy of pronunciation-related working memory tasks and reduced the response time. Compared with before sleep deprivation, the amplitudes of the event-related potentials (ERPs) increased in the N2 component and decreased in the P3 component after sleep deprivation in the placebo condition. In the caffeine condition, the amplitude of the P3 component decreased, the latency of the N2 component was prolonged, and the N2 amplitude remained unchanged. In the modafinil condition, the P3 latency was shortened, and no significant difference was found in the amplitude of the N2 or P3 ERPs; no significant difference was recorded in the N2 latency. Modafinil (400 mg) effectively ameliorated the decline in pronunciation-related working memory after 36-h TSD, suggesting that it may effectively counteract cognitive decline caused by acute sleep deprivation.

Dopaminergic role in regulating neurophysiological markers of sleep homeostasis in humans.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4128-13.2014	While dopamine affects fundamental brain processes such as movement control, emotional responses, addiction, and pain, the roles for this neurotransmitter in regulating wakefulness and sleep are incompletely understood. Genetically modified animal models with reduced dopamine clearance exhibit hypersensitivity to caffeine, reduced-responsiveness to modafinil, and increased homeostatic response to prolonged wakefulness when compared with wild-type animals. Here we studied sleep-wake regulation in humans and combined pharmacogenetic and neurophysiologic methods to analyze the effects of the 3'-UTR variable-number-tandem-repeat polymorphism of the gene (DAT1, SLC6A3) encoding dopamine transporter (DAT). Previous research demonstrated that healthy homozygous 10-repeat (10R/10R) allele carriers of this genetic variant have reduced striatal DAT protein expression when compared with 9-repeat (9R) allele carriers. Objective and subjective estimates of caffeine sensitivity were higher in 10R allele homozygotes than in carriers of the 9R allele. Moreover, caffeine and modafinil affected wakefulness-induced changes in functional bands (delta, sigma, beta) of rhythmic brain activity in wakefulness and sleep in a DAT1 genotype-dependent manner. Finally, the sleep deprivation-induced increase in well established neurophysiologic markers of sleep homeostasis, including slow-wave sleep, electroencephalographic slow-wave activity (0.5-4.5 Hz), and number of low-frequency (0.5-2.0 Hz) oscillations in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, was significantly larger in the 10R/10R genotype than in the 9R allele carriers of DAT1. Together, the data suggest that the dopamine transporter contributes to homeostatic sleep-wake regulation in humans.

Interest of modafinil, a new psychostimulant, during a sixty-hour sleep deprivation experiment.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1472-8206.1995.tb00295.x	Modafinil, a new psychostimulant, was evaluated in eight healthy volunteers subjected to 60 hours of sleep deprivation. During continued wakefulness, vigilance was evaluated by self-assessment questionnaires, analogue visual scales, multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT), sleep logs, and continuous ambulatory electroencephalographic recordings (EEG). Modafinil (200 mg) or a placebo was given every 8 hours for three days; the sessions were separated by a 15 day wash out period. Results indicated a satisfactory level of vigilance, both subjective and objective, after the administration of modafinil, characterised by the quasi total absence of microsleep episodes which gradually occurred under placebo conditions. The confirmed wakening potency of modafinil makes this substance suitable for therapeutic use in patients with sleep disorders such as Gelineau's syndrome and hypersomnia.

Concordant neurophysiological signatures of cognitive control in humans and rats.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-021-00998-4	Progress towards understanding neural mechanisms in humans relevant to psychiatric conditions has been hindered by a lack of translationally-relevant cognitive tasks for laboratory animals. Accordingly, there is a critical need to develop parallel neurophysiological assessments of domains of cognition, such as cognitive control, in humans and laboratory animals. To address this, we developed a touchscreen-based cognitive (Eriksen Flanker) task in rats and used its key characteristics to construct a novel human version, with similar testing parameters and endpoints across species. We obtained continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, including local field potentials in rats, and compared electrophysiological signatures locked to stimulus onset and responses across species. We also assessed whether behavioral or physiological task effects were modulated by modafinil, which enhances aspects of cognitive function in humans. In both species, the task elicited expected flanker interference effects (reduced accuracy) during high-conflict trials. Across homologous neuroanatomical loci, stimulus-locked increases in theta power during high-conflict trials as well as error-related negative potentials were observed. These endpoints were not affected by modafinil in either species. Despite some species-specific patterns, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of a rat Flanker task as well as cross-species behavioral and neurophysiological similarities, which may enable novel insights into the neural correlates of healthy and aberrant behavior and provide mechanistic insights relevant to treatment.

Incentive motivation is associated with striatal dopamine asymmetry.	DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2007.08.001	Dopamine plays an important role in modulating incentive motivation, expressed behaviorally as approach behavior. EEG studies report association between approach behavior and asymmetric pattern of activation in anterior cortical regions (as measured by the inverse of EEG alpha power). Therefore, individual differences in incentive motivation may reflect asymmetries in dopaminergic systems. We examined this hypothesis by studying the relationship between self-reported degree of incentive motivation, and asymmetry of D2 receptor availability in healthy volunteers. Nineteen healthy participants were studied with positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]raclopride to assess the availability of dopamine D2 receptors in left and right striatum. Incentive motivation was assessed by the Achievement scale of the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire. The Achievement score was negatively correlated with the Asymmetry Index ([R-L]/[R+L]) of D2 receptor availability (r=-.721, p=.001), suggesting that greater positive incentive motivation is associated with higher receptor availability in the left relative to the right hemisphere.

The norepinephrine system and its relevance for multi-component behavior.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.10.007	The ability to execute several actions in a specific temporal order to achieve an overarching goal, a process often termed action cascading or multi-component behavior, is essential for everyday life requirements. We are only at the beginning to understand the neurobiological mechanisms important for these cognitive processes. However, it is likely that the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system may be of importance. In the current study we examine the relevance of the LC-NE system for action cascading processes using a system neurophysiological approach combining high-density EEG recordings and source localization to analyze event-related potentials (ERPs) with recordings of pupil diameter as a proximate of LC-NE system activity. N=25 healthy participants performed an action cascading stop-change paradigm. Integrating ERPs and pupil diameter using Pearson correlations, the results show that the LC-NE system is important for processes related to multi-component behavior. However, the LC-NE system does not seem to be important during the time period of response selection processes during multi-component behavior (reflected in the P3) as well as during perceptual and attentional selection (P1 and N1 ERPs). Rather, it seems that the neurophysiological processes in the fore period of a possibly upcoming imperative stimulus to initiate multi-component behavior are correlated with the LC-NE system. It seems that the LC-NE system facilitates responses to task-relevant processes and supports task-related decision and response selection processes by preparing cognitive control processes in case these are required during multi-component behavior rather than modulating these processes once they are operating.

Pharmacological REM sleep suppression paradoxically improves rather than impairs skill memory.

Neurocognitive function in dopamine-β-hydroxylase deficiency.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2011.42	Dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DβH) deficiency is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by the complete absence of norepinephrine in the peripheral and the central nervous system. DβH-deficient patients suffer from several physical symptoms, which can be treated successfully with L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine, a synthetic precursor of norepinephrine. Informal clinical observations suggest that DβH-deficient patients do not have obvious cognitive impairments, even when they are not medicated, which is remarkable given the important role of norepinephrine in normal neurocognitive function. This study provided the first systematic investigation of neurocognitive function in human DβH deficiency. We tested 5 DβH-deficient patients and 10 matched healthy control participants on a comprehensive cognitive task battery, and examined their pupil dynamics, brain structure, and the P3 component of the electroencephalogram. All participants were tested twice; the patients were tested once ON and once OFF medication. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain revealed that the patients had a smaller total brain volume than the control group, which is in line with the recent hypothesis that norepinephrine has a neurotrophic effect. In addition, the patients showed an abnormally small or absent task-evoked pupil dilation. However, we found no substantial differences in cognitive performance or P3 amplitude between the patients and the control participants, with the exception of a temporal-attention deficit in the patients OFF medication. The largely spared neurocognitive function in DβH-deficient patients suggests that other neuromodulators have taken over the function of norepinephrine in the brains of these patients.

The acute effects of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor Org 4428 on EEG sleep in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1159/000026605	Drug-induced improvement of depression may be mediated by changes in sleep physiology. In earlier studies on sleep EEG changes during treatment with antidepressants in depressed patients it could not be excluded that sleep disruptions and changes in the amount and distribution of REM sleep play a role in the changes in the sleep EEG. Therefore knowledge of the effects of antidepressants on the sleep EEG in healthy subjects with non-disturbed baseline sleep is necessary. In a three-way cross-over study in 12 healthy volunteers two single doses of Org 4428 (a highly specific noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor), 25 and 100 mg, were compared with placebo. Sleep EEGs were visually analysed and EEG power of non-REM sleep was measured. The results indicate that sole noradrenaline reuptake inhibiting activity is a potent mechanism to affect sleep polygraphic variables in an antidepressant-like way, i.e. REM sleep suppression and lengthening of REM latency. Despite the increase in the duration of non-REM sleep, i.e. stage 2, no significant changes in EEG power in the range 1-15 Hz were found. Therefore, the acute REM sleep suppression of Org 4428 did not result in a simultaneous reduction of EEG power during non-REM sleep. To date, these and earlier results indicate that most drugs with antidepressant properties affect REM sleep variables consistently, whereas their effect on both sleep polygraphic and EEG power variables in non-REM sleep is unpredictable.

Reorganization of the composition of brain oscillations and their temporal characteristics during opioid withdrawal.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881108089810	Majority of the opioid-dependence and withdrawal studies are dominated with many inconsistencies and contradictions. One of the reasons for such inconsistencies may be methodological while performing EEG analysis. To overcome methodological limitations, in the present study we examined the composition of electroencephalographic (EEG) brain oscillations in broad frequency band (0.5-30 Hz) in 13 withdrawal opioid-dependent patients and 14 healthy subjects during resting condition (closed eyes). The exact compositions of brain oscillations and their temporal behaviour were assessed by the probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns (SPs). It was reported that early withdrawal had a generalized effect: the activity in all EEG channels was affected nearly equally. EEG of withdrawal patients was characterized by (a) different dominant SP types (had unique SP types which describe beta-frequency band), (b) increased number of SP types observed in each EEG channel, (c) a larger percentage of alpha(2)-, beta- and poly-rhythmic activity, and by a smaller percentage of delta-, - and alpha(1)-rhythmic activity, (d) predominantly right-sided asymmetry and (e) longer periods of temporal stabilization for alpha- and beta-brain oscillations and by shorter periods of temporal stabilization for -activity when compared with control subjects. When taken together, these findings suggest a considerable reorganization of composition of brain oscillations, which reflects a disorganization process and an allostatic state with neuronal activation in EEG of opioid withdrawal patients.

We recorded the pupillogram and the electroencephalogram of 36 young and 39 older adults, while they were engaged in cued reaction time tasks known to elicit LC responses in monkeys. Event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed significant group differences. Older adults showed higher cortical activation during preparatory processes reflected in enhanced cue-evoked frontocentral ERPs and reduced parietal ERPs at the time of the motor response. In contrast, the amplitude of the task-related pupillary responses did not show a significant group effect. Our findings suggest that aging-related changes in cortical processing during motor preparation and execution, as documented by electroencephalogram, are not accompanied by changes in the amplitude of activation of the LC, as documented by pupillography.

Phasic, Event-Related Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation Modifies Behavioral, Pupillary, and Low-Frequency Oscillatory Power Responses.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0452-23.2023	Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been proposed to activate the locus ceruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system. However, previous studies failed to find consistent modulatory effects of taVNS on LC-NA biomarkers. Previous studies suggest that phasic taVNS may be capable of modulating LC-NA biomarkers such as pupil dilation and alpha oscillations. However, it is unclear whether these effects extend beyond pure sensory vagal nerve responses. Critically, the potential of the pupillary light reflex as an additional taVNS biomarker has not been explored so far. Here, we applied phasic active and sham taVNS in 29 subjects (16 female, 13 male) while they performed an emotional Stroop task (EST) and a passive pupil light reflex task (PLRT). We recorded pupil size and brain activity dynamics using a combined Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and pupillometry design. Our results show that phasic taVNS significantly increased pupil dilation and performance during the EST. During the PLRT, active taVNS reduced and delayed pupil constriction. In the MEG, taVNS increased frontal-midline theta and alpha power during the EST, whereas occipital alpha power was reduced during both the EST and PLRT. Our findings provide evidence that phasic taVNS systematically modulates behavioral, pupillary, and electrophysiological parameters of LC-NA activity during cognitive processing. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the pupillary light reflex can be used as a simple and effective proxy of taVNS efficacy. These findings have important implications for the development of noninvasive neuromodulation interventions for various cognitive and clinical applications.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT taVNS has gained increasing attention as a noninvasive neuromodulation technique and is widely used in clinical and nonclinical research. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of action of taVNS is not yet fully understood. By assessing physiology and behavior in a response conflict task in healthy humans, we demonstrate the first successful application of a phasic, noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation to improve cognitive control and to systematically modulate pupillary and electrophysiological markers of the noradrenergic system. Understanding the mechanisms of action of taVNS could optimize future clinical applications and lead to better treatments for mental disorders associated with noradrenergic dysfunction. In addition, we present a new taVNS-sensitive pupillary measure representing an easy-to-use biomarker for future taVNS studies.

Auricular Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation Specifically Enhances Working Memory Gate Closing Mechanism: A System Neurophysiological Study.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2004-22.2023	Everyday tasks and goal-directed behavior involve the maintenance and continuous updating of information in working memory (WM). WM gating reflects switches between these two core states. Neurobiological considerations suggest that the catecholaminergic and the GABAergic are likely involved in these dynamics. Both of these neurotransmitter systems likely underlie the effects to auricular transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (atVNS). We examine the effects of atVNS on WM gating dynamics and their underlying neurophysiological and neurobiological processes in a randomized crossover study design in healthy humans of both sexes. We show that atVNS specifically modulates WM gate closing and thus specifically modulates neural mechanisms enabling the maintenance of information in WM. WM gate opening processes were not affected. atVNS modulates WM gate closing processes through the modulation of EEG alpha band activity. This was the case for clusters of activity in the EEG signal referring to stimulus information, motor response information, and fractions of information carrying stimulus-response mapping rules during WM gate closing. EEG-beamforming shows that modulations of activity in fronto-polar, orbital, and inferior parietal regions are associated with these effects. The data suggest that these effects are not because of modulations of the catecholaminergic (noradrenaline) system as indicated by lack of modulatory effects in pupil diameter dynamics, in the inter-relation of EEG and pupil diameter dynamics and saliva markers of noradrenaline activity. Considering other findings, it appears that a central effect of atVNS during cognitive processing refers to the stabilization of information in neural circuits, putatively mediated via the GABAergic system.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Goal-directed behavior depends on how well information in short-term memory can be flexibly updated but also on how well it can be shielded from distraction. These two functions were guarded by a working memory gate. We show how an increasingly popular brain stimulation techniques specifically enhances the ability to close the working memory gate to shield information from distraction. We show what physiological and anatomic aspects underlie these effects.

On the interrelation of 1/f neural noise and norepinephrine system activity during motor response inhibition.	DOI: 10.1152/jn.00701.2018	"Several lines of evidence suggest that there is a close interrelation between the degree of noise in neural circuits and the activity of the norepinephrine (NE) system, yet the precise nexus between these aspects is far from being understood during human information processing and cognitive control in particular. We examine this nexus during response inhibition in n = 47 healthy participants. Using high-density EEG recordings, we estimate neural noise by calculating ""1/f noise"" of those data and integrate these EEG parameters with pupil diameter data as an established indirect index of NE system activity. We show that neural noise is reduced when cognitive control processes to inhibit a prepotent/automated response are exerted. These neural noise variations were confined to the theta frequency band, which has also been shown to play a central role during response inhibition and cognitive control. There were strong positive correlations between the 1/f neural noise parameter and the pupil diameter data within the first 250 ms after the Nogo stimulus presentation at centro-parietal electrode sites. No such correlations were evident during automated responding on Go trials. Source localization analyses using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography show that inferior parietal areas are activated in this time period in Nogo trials. The data suggest an interrelation of NE system activity and neural noise within early stages of information processing associated with inferior parietal areas when cognitive control processes are required. The data provide the first direct evidence for the nexus between NE system activity and the modulation of neural noise during inhibitory control in humans. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study showing that there is a nexus between norepinephrine system activity and the modulation of neural noise or scale-free neural activity during inhibitory control in humans. It does so by integrating pupil diameter data with analysis of EEG neural noise."

Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Humans Induces Pupil Dilation and Attenuates Alpha Oscillations.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1361-20.2020	Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is widely used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and depression. While the precise mechanisms mediating its long-term therapeutic effects are not fully resolved, they likely involve locus coeruleus (LC) stimulation via the nucleus of the solitary tract, which receives afferent vagal inputs. In rats, VNS elevates LC firing and forebrain noradrenaline levels, whereas LC lesions suppress VNS therapeutic efficacy. Noninvasive transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) uses electrical stimulation that targets the auricular branch of the vagus nerve at the cymba conchae of the ear. However, the extent to which tVNS mimics VNS remains unclear. Here, we investigated the short-term effects of tVNS in healthy human male volunteers (n = 24), using high-density EEG and pupillometry during visual fixation at rest. We compared short (3.4 s) trials of tVNS to sham electrical stimulation at the earlobe (far from the vagus nerve branch) to control for somatosensory stimulation. Although tVNS and sham stimulation did not differ in subjective intensity ratings, tVNS led to robust pupil dilation (peaking 4-5 s after trial onset) that was significantly higher than following sham stimulation. We further quantified, using parallel factor analysis, how tVNS modulates idle occipital alpha (8-13Hz) activity identified in each participant. We found greater attenuation of alpha oscillations by tVNS than by sham stimulation. This demonstrates that tVNS reliably induces pupillary and EEG markers of arousal beyond the effects of somatosensory stimulation, thus supporting the hypothesis that tVNS elevates noradrenaline and other arousal-promoting neuromodulatory signaling, and mimics invasive VNS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Current noninvasive brain stimulation techniques are mostly confined to modulating cortical activity, as is typical with transcranial magnetic or transcranial direct/alternating current electrical stimulation. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has been proposed to stimulate subcortical arousal-promoting nuclei, though previous studies yielded inconsistent results. Here we show that short (3.4 s) tVNS pulses in naive healthy male volunteers induced transient pupil dilation and attenuation of occipital alpha oscillations. These markers of brain arousal are in line with the established effects of invasive VNS on locus coeruleus-noradrenaline signaling, and support that tVNS mimics VNS. Therefore, tVNS can be used as a tool for studying how endogenous subcortical neuromodulatory signaling affects human cognition, including perception, attention, memory, and decision-making; and also for developing novel clinical applications.

The Presynaptic Regulation of Dopamine and Norepinephrine Synthesis Has Dissociable Effects on Different Kinds of Cognitive Conflicts.	DOI: 10.1007/s12035-019-01664-z	Goal-directed behavior requires the ability to resolve subliminally or consciously induced response conflicts, both of which may benefit from catecholamine-induced increases in gain control. We investigated the effects of presynaptic differences in dopamine and norepinephrine synthesis with the help of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) rs10770141 and the dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) rs1611115, rs6271, and rs1611122 polymorphisms. Conscious and subliminal response conflicts were induced with flanker and prime distractors in (n = 207) healthy young participants while neurophysiological data (EEG) was recorded. The results demonstrated that the increased presynaptic catecholamine synthesis associated with the TH rs10770141 TT genotype improves cognitive control in case of consciously perceived (flanker) conflicts, but not in case of subliminally processed (prime) conflicts. Only norepinephrine seemed to also modulate subliminal conflict processing, as evidenced by better performance of the DBH rs1611122 CC genotype in case of high subliminal conflict load. Better performance was linked to larger conflict-induced modulations in post-response alpha band power arising from parietal and inferior frontal regions, which likely helps to suppress the processing of distracting information. In summary, presynaptic catecholamine synthesis benefits consciously perceived conflicts by improving the suppression of distracting information following a conflict. Subliminal conflicts were modulated via the same mechanism, but only by norepinephrine.

Simultaneous EEG-fMRI reveals temporal evolution of coupling between supramodal cortical attention networks and the brainstem.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2649-13.2013	Cortical and subcortical networks have been identified that are commonly associated with attention and task engagement, along with theories regarding their functional interaction. However, a link between these systems has not yet been demonstrated in healthy humans, primarily because of data acquisition and analysis limitations. We recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI while subjects performed auditory and visual oddball tasks and used these data to investigate the BOLD correlates of single-trial EEG variability at latencies spanning the trial. We focused on variability along task-relevant dimensions in the EEG for identical stimuli and then combined auditory and visual data at the subject level to spatially and temporally localize brain regions involved in endogenous attentional modulations. Specifically, we found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) correlates strongly with both early and late EEG components, whereas brainstem, right middle frontal gyrus (rMFG), and right orbitofrontal cortex (rOFC) correlate significantly only with late components. By orthogonalizing with respect to event-related activity, we found that variability in insula and temporoparietal junction is reflected in reaction time variability, rOFC and brainstem correlate with residual EEG variability, and ACC and rMFG are significantly correlated with both. To investigate interactions between these correlates of temporally specific EEG variability, we performed dynamic causal modeling (DCM) on the fMRI data. We found strong evidence for reciprocal effective connections between the brainstem and cortical regions. Our results support the adaptive gain theory of locus ceruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) function and the proposed functional relationship between the LC-NE system, right-hemisphere ventral attention network, and P300 EEG response.

Association study of a functional MAOA-uVNTR gene polymorphism and cognitive function in healthy females.	DOI: 10.1159/000086609	Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the degradation of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine and these neurotransmitters are hypothesized to be involved in the cognitive function of humans. This study of a cohort of 191 healthy young Chinese females attempts to utilize the intelligence quotient (IQ), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and P300 event-related potentials as cognitive assessments for testing the relationship between the polymorphism with a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the upstream regulatory region (MAOA-uVNTR) and cognition. The results demonstrate that subjects bearing the 4/4-repeat genotype have a significantly higher full IQ than subjects bearing the 3/3-repeat genotype. However, there is no significant association between this MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism and the WCST and P300. Our study shows that the MAOA-uVNTR genetic polymorphism plays a role in the IQ; however, this may be a chance finding as the result was negative after using the Bonferroni adjustment. Therefore, we suggest that our study should be replicated and that the testing method, sex, disease and ethnicity should also be considered in future studies.

Quantitative electroencephalographic correlates of steroid administration in man.	DOI: 10.1159/000118985	Elevated levels of circulating corticosteroids are frequently associated with behavioral alterations in man, although the mechanisms by which corticosteroids may affect behavior are poorly understood. To evaluate possible effects of exogenous corticosteroids on brain electrophysiological functioning and the relationship of such effects to behavioral and biochemical changes, we administered prednisone (80 mg p.o. daily for 5 days) in a double-blind manner to 11 medically healthy volunteers. Quantitative electroencephalogram analysis was performed following 4 days of prednisone administration and during the preceding and ensuing placebo administration periods. Central theta wave brain electrical activity significantly increased following prednisone administration and returned to baseline following prednisone withdrawal. This effect was directly correlated with prednisone-induced increases in subjective sadness ratings and with decreases in self-rated energy and well-being. Prednisone-induced reductions in peak alpha wave activity were also directly correlated with increases in subjective sadness and Symptom Checklist-90 ratings and with decreases in self-rated 'hypomanic' symptoms. Further, prednisone-induced increases in theta activity were significantly correlated with prednisone-induced decreases in CSF levels of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity, and prednisone-induced decreases in peak alpha activity were significantly correlated with decreases in CSF levels of norepinephrine and with relative increases (or lesser decreases) in CSF levels of beta-endorphin and beta-lipotropic hormone. This preliminary report of the concomitant development of prednisone-induced changes in brain electrical activity, neurochemistry and behavior highlights areas for future exploration in the study of corticosteroid effects on behavior in man.

A polymorphism of the MAOA gene is associated with emotional brain markers and personality traits on an antisocial index.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2009.1	Association studies suggest that the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-uVNTR polymorphism confers risk for emotional disturbances associated with antisocial traits, particularly in males. Here, we assessed the low (MAOA-L) activity variant in relation to both brain function and a behavioral index of antisocial traits. From an initial sample of 290 healthy participants, 210 had low (MAOA-L) or high (MAOA-H) activity variants. Participants underwent a brief assessment of personality traits and event-related potential (ERP) recording during an emotion-processing task. Genotype differences in ERPs were localized using LORETA. The MAOA-L genotype was distinguished by elevated scores on the index of antisocial traits. These traits were related to altered ERPs elicited 120-280ms post-stimulus, particularly for negative emotion. Altered neural processing of anger in MAOA-L genotypes was localized to medial frontal, parietal, and superior temporo-occipital regions in males, but only to the superior occipital cortex in females. The MAOA low activity variant may increase susceptibility to antisocial traits through alterations to the neural systems for processing threat-related emotion, especially for males. Monoamines such as noradrenalin and serotonin may modulate these relationships, given that their metabolism varies according to MAOA variants, and that they modulate both emotional brain systems and antisocial aggression.

Reduced ERPs and theta oscillations underlie working memory deficits in Toxoplasma gondii infected seniors.	DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2016.08.002	Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most widespread infections in humans. Recent studies give evidence for memory deficits in infected older adults. To investigate working memory dysfunction in infected elderly, a double-blinded electrophysiological study was conducted. 84 persons derived from a sample of 131 healthy participants with the mean age of 70 years were assigned to two groups of 42 non-infected and 42 infected individuals. The outcome measures were behavioral performance, target and response-related ERPs, and time-frequency wavelets during performance in a n-back working-memory task. The infected individuals showed a reduced rate of detected targets and diminished P3b amplitude both in target-locked as well as response-locked data compared to the non-infected group. Time-frequency decomposition of the EEG-signals revealed lower evoked power in the theta frequency range in the target-locked as well as in the response-locked data in infected individuals. The reported effects were comparable with differences between healthy young and old adults described previously. Taking together, the reduced working-memory performance accompanied by an attenuated P3b and frontal theta activity may suggest neurotransmitter imbalance like dopamine and norepinephrine in T. gondii infected individuals. In face of a high prevalence of T. gondii infection and the increasing ratio of older population their accelerated memory decline may have substantial socioeconomic consequences.

Does induced hypertension reduce cerebral ischaemia within the traumatized human brain?	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awh268	Recent changes in published guidelines for the management of patients with severe head injury are based on data showing that aggressive maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) can worsen outcome due to extracranial complications of therapy. However, it remains unclear whether CPP augmentation could reduce cerebral ischaemia, a finding which might prompt the search for CPP augmentation protocols that avoid these extracranial complications. We studied 10 healthy volunteers and 20 patients within 6 days of closed head injury. All subjects underwent imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood volume (CBV), oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) using 15O PET. In addition, for patients, the EEG power ratio index (PRI), burst suppression ratio and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were obtained and CPP was increased from 68 +/- 4 to 90 +/- 4 mmHg using an infusion of norepinephrine and measurements were repeated. Following elevation of CPP, CBF and CBV were increased and CMRO2 and OEF were reduced (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Regions with a reduction in CMRO2 were associated with the greatest reduction in OEF (r2 = 0.3; P < 0.0001). Although CPP elevation produced a significant fall in the ischaemic brain volume (IBV) (from 15 +/- 16 to 5 +/- 4 ml; P < 0.01) and improved flow metabolism coupling, the IBV was small and clinically insignificant in the majority of these patients. However, the reduction in IBV was directly related to the baseline IBV (r2 = 0.97; P < 0.001) and patients with large baseline IBV showed substantial and clinically significant reductions. CPP augmentation increased the EEG PRI (5.0 +/- 1.5 versus 4.3 +/- 1.4, P < 0.01), implying an overall decrease in neural activity, but these changes did not correlate with the reduction in CMRO2 and there was no change in SEP cortical amplitude (N20-P27). These data provide support for recent changes in recommended CPP levels for head injury management across populations of patients with significant head injury. However, they do not provide guidance on whether the intervention may be more appropriate at earlier stages after injury, or in patients selected because of high baseline IBV. It also remains unclear whether CPP values below 65 mmHg can be safely used in this population. Clarification of the significance of a reduction in CMRO2 and neuronal electrical function will require further study.

"A Deletion Variant of the α2b-Adrenoceptor Modulates the Stress-Induced Shift from ""Cognitive"" to ""Habit"" Memory."	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3507-16.2017	"Stress induces a shift from hippocampus-based ""cognitive"" toward dorsal striatum-based ""habitual"" learning and memory. This shift is thought to have important implications for stress-related psychopathologies, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, there is large individual variability in the stress-induced bias toward habit memory, and the factors underlying this variability are completely unknown. Here we hypothesized that a functional deletion variant of the gene encoding the α2b-adrenoceptor (ADRA2B), which has been linked to emotional memory processes and increased PTSD risk, modulates the stress-induced shift from cognitive toward habit memory. In two independent experimental studies, healthy humans were genotyped for the ADRA2B deletion variant. After a stress or control manipulation, participants completed a dual-solution learning task while electroencephalographic (Study I) or fMRI measurements (Study II) were taken. Carriers compared with noncarriers of the ADRA2B deletion variant exhibited a significantly reduced bias toward habit memory after stress. fMRI results indicated that, whereas noncarriers of the ADRA2B deletion variant showed increased functional connectivity between amygdala and putamen after stress, this increase in connectivity was absent in carriers of the deletion variant, who instead showed overall enhanced connectivity between amygdala and entorhinal cortex. Our results indicate that a common genetic variation of the noradrenergic system modulates the impact of stress on the balance between cognitive and habitual memory systems, most likely via altered amygdala orchestration of these systems.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Stressful events have a powerful effect on human learning and memory. Specifically, accumulating evidence suggests that stress favors more rigid dorsal striatum-dependent habit memory, at the expense of flexible hippocampus-dependent cognitive memory. Although this shift may have important implications for understanding mental disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, little is known about the source of individual differences in the sensitivity for the stress-induced bias toward habit memory. We report here that a common genetic variation of the noradrenergic system, a known risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder, modulates the stress-induced shift from cognitive to habit memory, most likely through altered crosstalk between the hippocampus and dorsal striatum with the amygdala, a key structure in emotional memory."

Locus coeruleus activity while awake is associated with REM sleep quality in older individuals.	DOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.172008	BACKGROUNDThe locus coeruleus (LC) is the primary source of norepinephrine in the brain and regulates arousal and sleep. Animal research shows that it plays important roles in the transition between sleep and wakefulness, and between slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). It is unclear, however, whether the activity of the LC predicts sleep variability in humans.METHODSWe used 7-Tesla functional MRI, sleep electroencephalography (EEG), and a sleep questionnaire to test whether the LC activity during wakefulness was associated with sleep quality in 33 healthy younger (~22 years old; 28 women, 5 men) and 19 older (~61 years old; 14 women, 5 men) individuals.RESULTSWe found that, in older but not in younger participants, higher LC activity, as probed during an auditory attentional task, was associated with worse subjective sleep quality and with lower power over the EEG theta band during REMS. The results remained robust even when accounting for the age-related changes in the integrity of the LC.CONCLUSIONThese findings suggest that LC activity correlates with the perception of the sleep quality and an essential oscillatory mode of REMS, and we found that the LC may be an important target in the treatment of sleep- and age-related diseases.FUNDINGThis work was supported by Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FRS-FNRS, T.0242.19 & J. 0222.20), Action de Recherche Concertée - Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles (ARC SLEEPDEM 17/27-09), Fondation Recherche Alzheimer (SAO-FRA 2019/0025), ULiège, and European Regional Development Fund (Radiomed & Biomed-Hub).

Anodal tDCS affects neuromodulatory effects of the norepinephrine system on superior frontal theta activity during response inhibition.	DOI: 10.1007/s00429-019-01839-3	Medial and superior frontal theta oscillations are important for response inhibition. The norepinephrine (NE) system has been shown to modulate these oscillations possibly via gain control mechanisms, which depend on the modulation of neuron membrane potentials. Because the latter are also modulated by tDCS, the interrelation of tDCS and NE effects on superior frontal theta band activity needs investigation. We test the hypothesis that anodal tDCS affects modulatory effects of the NE system on theta band activity during inhibitory control in superior frontal regions. Using EEG beamforming, theta band activity in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) was integrated (correlated) with the pupil diameter data as an indirect index of NE activity. In a within-subject design, healthy participants completed a response inhibition task in two sessions in which they received 2 mA anodal tDCS over the vertex, or sham stimulation. There were no behavioral effects of anodal tDCS. Yet, tDCS affected correlations between SFG theta band activity time course and the pupil diameter time course. Correlations were evident after sham stimulation (r = .701; p < .004), but absent after anodal tDCS. The observed power of this dissociation was above 95%. The data suggest that anodal tDCS may eliminate neuromodulatory effects, likely of the NE system, on theta band activity during response inhibition in a structure of the response inhibition network. The NE system and tDCS seem to target similar mechanisms important for cognitive control in the prefrontal cortex. The results provide a hint why tDCS often fails to induce overt behavioral effects and shows that neurobiological systems, which may exert similar effects as tDCS on neural processes should closely be monitored in tDCS experiments.

An analytical approach to network motif detection in samples of networks with pairwise different vertex labels.	DOI: 10.1155/2012/910380	Network motifs, overrepresented small local connection patterns, are assumed to act as functional meaningful building blocks of a network and, therefore, received considerable attention for being useful for understanding design principles and functioning of networks. We present an extension of the original approach to network motif detection in single, directed networks without vertex labeling to the case of a sample of directed networks with pairwise different vertex labels. A characteristic feature of this approach to network motif detection is that subnetwork counts are derived from the whole sample and the statistical tests are adjusted accordingly to assign significance to the counts. The associated computations are efficient since no simulations of random networks are involved. The motifs obtained by this approach also comprise the vertex labeling and its associated information and are characteristic of the sample. Finally, we apply this approach to describe the intricate topology of a sample of vertex-labeled networks which originate from a previous EEG study, where the processing of painful intracutaneous electrical stimuli and directed interactions within the neuromatrix of pain in patients with major depression and healthy controls was investigated. We demonstrate that the presented approach yields characteristic patterns of directed interactions while preserving their important topological information and omitting less relevant interactions.

The effects of venlafaxine on cognitive functions and quantitative EEG in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2008-1076724	Antidepressants that selectively block serotonin uptake may cause unwanted effects on cognitive functions such as impairment of vigilance and memory. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over trial was performed to examine the effects of venlafaxine, a selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI), on cognitive functions and quantitative EEG (qEEG) in humans. 12 healthy male subjects aged 23-32 years (26+/-3 years mean+/-sd) orally received 37.5 mg venlafaxine b.i.d. for 7 days and subsequently 75 mg b.i.d. for another 7 days. After a 14-day wash-out phase, placebo was administered to the subjects for 14 days under randomized double-blind cross-over conditions. Venlafaxine did not influence cognitive functions such as choice reaction, memory, psychomotor performance and subjective mood. Placebo resulted in an increase in slow alpha power (p<0.05) whereas venlafaxine had no effect on qEEG. In conclusion, multiple dosing with venlafaxine did not influence cognitive functions in healthy humans.

Effects of copper toxicity on response inhibition processes: a study in Wilson's disease.	DOI: 10.1007/s00204-015-1609-3	Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disease causing copper deposits in various tissues. Given the specificity of the underlying pathology, it is a good model to investigate the effects of copper toxicity on cognitive functions in humans. If left untreated, WD results in neurodegeneration and organ failure, but irrespective of potential brain damage, the medication might reduce cortical norepinephrine (NE) levels. In line with this, dysexecutive symptoms including increased impulsivity have been reported for WD patients, but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. We investigated inhibition and the associated neurophysiological correlates in n = 26 WD patients with mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms and matched healthy controls who completed a Go/Nogo task, while an EEG was recorded. Although the behavioral data do not show increased impulsivity in WD, the neurophysiological data show that evaluative processing of successful inhibition (as reflected by the P3 component) was strongly compromised. This was reflected by a decrease in ACC activity which was positively correlated with the severity of WD symptoms, stressing the importance of copper (toxicity) for neurocognitive functioning and impulsivity. These changes are most likely due to a combination of NE deficiency induced by WD medication as well as WD-induced brain damage. The fact that changes were still evident on a neurophysiological level suggests that neurophysiological correlates of cognitive processes and functions provide a more sensitive index of toxicity and/or treatment efficiency than purely behavioral measures.

Ultradian sleep rhythms of lateral EEG, autonomic, and cardiovascular activity are coupled in humans.	DOI: 10.3109/00207450008986490	This study compared the dynamics of multiple systems during sleep with earlier results during waking rest. Three consecutive nights of data were collected from three healthy adults for 10 variables: left and right central EEGs; the nasal cycle (NC); beat-to-beat measures of CO, SV, HR, SBP, DBP, MAP, and hemoglobin-oxygen saturation. Time series analysis detected periods at 280-300, 215-275, 165-210, 145-160, 105-140, 70-100, and 40-65 min bins with the greatest spectral power in longer periods. We found significance across subjects with all parameters at 280-300, 105-140 (except left EEG power, left minus right EEG power, and HR), 70-100, and 40-65 min. Significant periods were reported earlier during waking for the NC, pituitary hormones, catecholamines, insulin, and cardiovascular function in five bins at 220-340, 170-215, 115-145, 70-100, and 40-65 min, with 115-145, 70-100, and 40-65 min common across all variables. These results suggest that lateral EEG power during sleep has a common pacemaker (the hypothalamus), or a mutually entrained pacemaker, with the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems (ANS), and that the waking ultradians of the neuroendocrine and fuel regulatory hormones may also be coupled to lateral EEG activity. Taken together these results present a new perspective for the Basic Rest-Activity Cycle and the physiology of the ANS-central nervous system during both waking and sleep.

Acute effects of the novel antidepressant venlafaxine on cognitive event-related potentials (P300), eye blink rate and mood in young healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1097/00004850-199300830-00004	"Venlafaxine is a novel non-tricyclic antidepressant, which preclinically has demonstrated serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake inhibiting effects. In this study acute effects of single oral doses of placebo, 12.5 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg venlafaxine on event-related potentials (ERPs), eye blink rate and mood were studied in 16 healthy subjects. ERPs were investigated in an auditory odd-ball paradigm before as well as 3 h after each drug intake. In addition to 17 EEG leads, vertical and horizontal EOGs were recorded. After EOG minimization and visual artefact rejection the peak latencies of the spatial average were determined by an automatic procedure. The applied methods of data acquisition, artefact processing, objective component determination and statistical analysis were successful in describing acute effects of venlafaxine on ERPs in normals. N1 and P2 latencies were not affected. An increase in P2 amplitude in the relevant central and frontal regions was seen, reflecting some effect on automatic information processing. Stimulus evaluation time was not affected, as P300 latency remained unchanged. P300 amplitude was not affected at the relevant central and parietal region. Blink rate was not changed. By means of the adjective checklist a dose-dependent decrease of ""extroversion"" and ""high spirits"" and an increase of ""introversion"" was observed.

Electroencephalographic changes and periodontal status during short-term vitamin B-6 depletion of young, nonpregnant women.	DOI: 10.1093/ajcn/53.5.1266	As part of a larger investigation to determine the effect of animal vs. plant proteins on the vitamin B-6 requirement of young women, clinical changes during vitamin B-6 depletion were documented. Eight healthy young women were confined to a metabolic unit and fed a defined formula diet nearly devoid of vitamin B-6 (less than 0.05 mg/d). Serial electroencephalographic (EEG) tracings, peripheral nervous system tests, periodontal evaluations, and biochemical measures of vitamin B-6 status were conducted. Within 12 d on the depletion diet, two of the eight women exhibited abnormal EEG tracings. These changes were readily reversed by repletion of vitamin B-6 at the 0.5-mg/d level. Biochemical measures reflected lowered vitamin B-6 status but were not predictive of the onset of EEG changes. No detectable alterations in oral or periodontal status were found, nor did plaque flora change markedly. This study is the first report of EEG changes occurring in women undergoing vitamin B-6 depletion and the first report to document EEG changes in adults within 12 d on a vitamin B-6-depletion regimen.

Propofol blood concentration and the Bispectral Index predict suppression of learning during propofol/epidural anesthesia in volunteers.	DOI: 10.1097/00000539-199512000-00025	Propofol is often used for sedation during regional anesthesia. We tested the hypothesis that propofol blood concentration, the Bispectral Index and the 95% spectral edge frequency predict suppression of learning during propofol/epidural anesthesia in volunteers. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that the Bispectral Index is linearly related to propofol blood concentration. Fourteen healthy, male volunteers were studied on three randomly ordered days: no propofol, target propofol blood concentration 1 microgram/mL, and target propofol blood concentration 2 micrograms/mL. Each day, epidural anesthesia (approximately T11 level) was induced using 2% 2-chloroprocaine. Propofol was infused by a computer-controlled pump, and propofol concentration measured in central venous blood. We administered a Trivial Pursuit-type question task on all 3 days. The electroencephalogram was monitored continuously (Fp1, Fp2; reference, Cz; ground, mastoid). Propofol caused concentration-related impairment of learning. The propofol blood concentration suppressing learning by 50% was 0.66 +/- 0.1 microgram/mL. The Bispectral Index value when learning was suppressed by 50% was 91 +/- 1. In contrast, the 95% spectral edge frequency did not correlate well with learning. The Bispectral Index decreased linearly as propofol blood concentration increased (Bispectral Index = -7.4.[propofol] + 90; r2 = 0.47, n = 278). There was no significant correlation between the 95% spectral edge frequency and propofol concentration. In order to suppress learning, propofol blood concentrations reported to produce amnesia may be targeted. Alternatively, the Bispectral Index may be used to predict anesthetic effect during propofol sedation.

Different Spectral Analysis Methods for the Theta/Beta Ratio Calculate Different Ratios But Do Not Distinguish ADHD from Controls.	DOI: 10.1007/s10484-020-09471-2	There has been ongoing research on the ratio of theta to beta power (Theta/Beta Ratio, TBR) as an EEG-based test in the diagnosis of ADHD. Earlier studies reported significant TBR differences between patients with ADHD and controls. However, a recent meta-analysis revealed a marked decline of effect size for the difference in TBR between ADHD and controls for studies published in the past decade. Here, we test if differences in EEG processing explain the heterogeneity of findings. We analyzed EEG data from two multi-center clinical studies. Five different EEG signal processing algorithms were applied to calculate the TBR. Differences between resulting TBRs were subsequently assessed for clinical usability in the iSPOT-A dataset. Although there were significant differences in the resulting TBRs, none distinguished between children with and without ADHD, and no consistent associations with ADHD symptoms arose. Different methods for EEG signal processing result in significantly different TBRs. However, none of the methods significantly distinguished between ADHD and healthy controls in our sample. The secular effect size decline for the TBR is most likely explained by factors other than differences in EEG signal processing, e.g. fewer hours of sleep in participants and differences in inclusion criteria for healthy controls.

Resting EEG Measures of Brain Arousal in a Multisite Study of Major Depression.	DOI: 10.1177/1550059418795578	Several studies have found upregulated brain arousal during 15-minute EEG recordings at rest in depressed patients. However, studies based on shorter EEG recording intervals are lacking. Here we aimed to compare measures of brain arousal obtained from 2-minute EEGs at rest under eyes-closed condition in depressed patients and healthy controls in a multisite project-Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC). We expected that depressed patients would show stable and elevated brain arousal relative to controls. Eighty-seven depressed patients and 36 healthy controls from four research sites in the United States were included in the analyses. The Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig (VIGALL) was used for the fully automatic classification of EEG-vigilance stages (indicating arousal states) of 1-second EEG segments; VIGALL-derived measures of brain arousal were calculated. We found that depressed patients scored higher on arousal stability ( Z = -2.163, P = .015) and A stages (dominant alpha activity; P = .027) but lower on B1 stages (low-voltage non-alpha activity, P = .008) compared with healthy controls. No significant group differences were observed in Stage B2/3. In summary, we were able to demonstrate stable and elevated brain arousal during brief 2-minute recordings at rest in depressed patients. Results set the stage for examining the value of these measures for predicting clinical response to antidepressants in the entire EMBARC sample and evaluating whether an upregulated brain arousal is particularly characteristic for responders to antidepressants.

Interactive effects of an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist on mismatch negativity: Implications for schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.schres.2017.06.040	N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, including auditory processing abnormalities reflected by the mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential component. Evidence suggesting cognitive benefits from nicotine administration, together with the high rate of cigarette use in patients with schizophrenia, has stimulated interest in whether nicotine modulates NMDAR hypofunction. We examined the interactive effects of ketamine, an NMDAR antagonist that produces transient schizophrenia-like neurophysiological effects, and nicotine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, in 30 healthy volunteers to determine whether nicotine prevents or attenuates MMN abnormalities. Secondary analyses compared the profile of ketamine and schizophrenia effects on MMN using previously reported data from 24 schizophrenia patients (Hay et al. 2015). Healthy volunteers completed four test days, during which they received ketamine/placebo and nicotine/placebo in a double-blind, counterbalanced design. MMN to intensity, frequency, duration, and frequency+duration double deviant sounds was assessed each day. Ketamine decreased intensity, frequency, and double deviant MMN amplitudes, whereas nicotine increased intensity and double deviant MMN amplitudes. A ketamine×nicotine interaction indicated, however, that nicotine failed to attenuate the decrease in MMN associated with ketamine. Although the present dose of ketamine produced smaller decrements in MMN than those associated with schizophrenia, the profile of effects across deviant types did not differ between ketamine and schizophrenia. Results suggest that while ketamine and schizophrenia produce similar profiles of MMN effects across deviant types, nicotinic agonists may have limited potential to improve these putative NMDAR hypofunction-mediated impairments in schizophrenia.

Early auditory processing evoked potentials (N100) show a continuum of blunting from clinical high risk to psychosis in a pediatric sample.

EEG hemispheric asymmetries during cognitive tasks in depressed patients with high versus low trait anxiety.	DOI: 10.1177/155005941004100406	Studies of regional hemispheric asymmetries point to relatively less activity in left frontal and right posterior regions in depression. Anxiety was associated with increased right posterior activity, which may be related to arousal and, in anxious-depressed individuals, offset the posterior asymmetry typically seen in depression. These asymmetries have been indexed by resting EEG or inferred through the use of lateralized auditory and visual tasks (e.g., dichotic listening and chimeric faces). However, associations between regional EEG activity and neurocognitive function in depression or anxiety remain unclear. The present study used matched verbal (Word Finding) and spatial (Dot Localization) tasks to compare task-related alpha asymmetries in depressed patients grouped according to level of trait anxiety. EEG and behavioral performance were recorded from depressed patients with high anxiety (n = 14) or low anxiety (n = 14) and 21 age- and education-matched healthy adults during the two tasks, and alpha power was averaged within each task. As predicted, the two patient groups exhibited opposite patterns of regional hemispheric alpha asymmetry. Greater right than left central-parietal activation was seen in the high-anxiety depressed group during the spatial task, whereas greater left than right frontal-central activation was found in the low-anxiety depressed group during the verbal task. Group differences in task performance were in the expected direction but did not reach statistical significance. These results are consistent with Heller's two-dimensional model of depression and anxiety and highlight the sensitivity of task-related EEG alpha in discriminating among subgroups of depressed patients differing in trait anxiety.

Neural indices of heritable impulsivity: Impact of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism on frontal beta power during early motor preparation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2024.108826	"Studies of COMT Val158Met suggest that the neural circuitry subserving inhibitory control may be modulated by this functional polymorphism altering cortical dopamine availability, thus giving rise to heritable differences in behaviors. Using an anatomically-constrained magnetoencephalography method and stratifying the sample by COMT genotype, from a larger sample of 153 subjects, we examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of beta oscillations during motor execution and inhibition in 21 healthy Met158/Met158 (high dopamine) or 21 Val158/Val158 (low dopamine) genotype individuals during a Go/NoGo paradigm. While task performance was unaffected, Met158 homozygotes demonstrated an overall increase in beta power across regions essential for inhibitory control during early motor preparation (∼100 ms latency), suggestive of a global motor ""pause"" on behavior. This increase was especially evident on Go trials with slow response speed and was absent during inhibition failures. Such a pause could underlie the tendency of Met158 allele carriers to be more cautious and inhibited. In contrast, Val158 homozygotes exhibited a beta drop during early motor preparation, indicative of high response readiness. This decrease was associated with measures of behavioral disinhibition and consistent with greater extraversion and impulsivity observed in Val homozygotes. These results provide mechanistic insight into genetically-determined interindividual differences of inhibitory control with higher cortical dopamine associated with momentary response hesitation, and lower dopamine leading to motor impulsivity."

Premotor cortical beta synchronization and the network neuromodulation of externally paced finger tapping in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nbd.2024.106529	Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the disruption of repetitive, concurrent and sequential motor actions due to compromised timing-functions principally located in cortex-basal ganglia (BG) circuits. Increasing evidence suggests that motor impairments in untreated PD patients are linked to an excessive synchronization of cortex-BG activity at beta frequencies (13-30 Hz). Levodopa and subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) suppress pathological beta-band reverberation and improve the motor symptoms in PD. Yet a dynamic tuning of beta oscillations in BG-cortical loops is fundamental for movement-timing and synchronization, and the impact of PD therapies on sensorimotor functions relying on neural transmission in the beta frequency-range remains controversial. Here, we set out to determine the differential effects of network neuromodulation through dopaminergic medication (ON and OFF levodopa) and STN-DBS (ON-DBS, OFF-DBS) on tapping synchronization and accompanying cortical activities. To this end, we conducted a rhythmic finger-tapping study with high-density EEG-recordings in 12 PD patients before and after surgery for STN-DBS and in 12 healthy controls. STN-DBS significantly ameliorated tapping parameters as frequency, amplitude and synchrony to the given auditory rhythms. Aberrant neurophysiologic signatures of sensorimotor feedback in the beta-range were found in PD patients: their neural modulation was weaker, temporally sluggish and less distributed over the right cortex in comparison to controls. Levodopa and STN-DBS boosted the dynamics of beta-band modulation over the right hemisphere, hinting to an improved timing of movements relying on tactile feedback. The strength of the post-event beta rebound over the supplementary motor area correlated significantly with the tapping asynchrony in patients, thus indexing the sensorimotor match between the external auditory pacing signals and the performed taps. PD patients showed an excessive interhemispheric coherence in the beta-frequency range during the finger-tapping task, while under DBS-ON the cortico-cortical connectivity in the beta-band was normalized. Ultimately, therapeutic DBS significantly ameliorated the auditory-motor coupling of PD patients, enhancing the electrophysiological processing of sensorimotor feedback-information related to beta-band activity, and thus allowing a more precise cued-tapping performance.

Heartbeat-evoked neural response abnormalities in generalized anxiety disorder during peripheral adrenergic stimulation.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-024-01806-5	Hyperarousal symptoms in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are often incongruent with the observed physiological state, suggesting that abnormal processing of interoceptive signals is a characteristic feature of the disorder. To examine the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive dysfunction in GAD, we evaluated whether adrenergic modulation of cardiovascular signaling differentially affects the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), an electrophysiological marker of cardiac interoception, during concurrent electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) scanning. Intravenous infusions of the peripheral adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (0.5 and 2.0 micrograms, μg) were administered in a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled fashion to dynamically perturb the cardiovascular system while recording the associated EEG-fMRI responses. During the 0.5 μg isoproterenol infusion, the GAD group (n = 24) exhibited significantly larger changes in HEP amplitude in an opposite direction than the healthy comparison (HC) group (n = 24). In addition, the GAD group showed significantly larger absolute HEP amplitudes than the HC group during saline infusions, when cardiovascular tone did not increase. No significant group differences in HEP amplitude were identified during the 2.0 μg isoproterenol infusion. Using analyzable blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI data from participants with concurrent EEG-fMRI data (21 GAD and 21 HC), we found that the aforementioned HEP effects were uncorrelated with fMRI signals in the insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and somatosensory cortex, brain regions implicated in cardiac signal processing in prior fMRI studies. These findings provide additional evidence of dysfunctional cardiac interoception in GAD and identify neural processes at the electrophysiological level that may be independent from blood oxygen level-dependent responses during peripheral adrenergic stimulation.

Abnormally low sensorimotor α band nonlinearity serves as an effective EEG biomarker of Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1152/jn.00272.2023	Biomarkers obtained from the neurophysiological signals of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have objective value in assessing their motor condition for effective diagnosis, monitoring, and clinical intervention. Prominent cortical biomarkers of PD have typically been derived from various β band wave features. This study approached the topic from an alternative perspective and attempted to estimate a recently suggested measure representing α band nonlinear autocorrelative memory from a publicly available EEG dataset that involves 15 patients with earlier-stage PD (dopaminergic medication OFF and ON states) and 16 age-matched healthy controls. The cortical nonlinearity was elevated for the PD ON state compared with the OFF state for bilateral sensorimotor channels C3 and C4 (n = 26; P = 0.003). A similar statistical difference was also identified between PD OFF state and healthy subjects (n = 26; P = 0.049). Analysis over all channels revealed that the α band nonlinearity induced upon medication was constrained to sensorimotor regions. The α nonlinearity measure was compared with a well-accepted cortical biomarker of β-γ phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). They were in moderate negative correlation (r = -0.412; P = 0.036) for only healthy subjects, but not for the patients. The nonlinearity measure was found to be insusceptible to the nonstationary variations within the particular data. Our study provides further evidence that the α band nonlinearity measure can serve as a promising cortical biomarker of PD. The suggested measure can be estimated from a noninvasive low-resolution single scalp EEG channel of patients with relatively early-stage PD, who did not yet need to undergo deep brain stimulation operation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study suggests a nonlinearity measure that differentiates Parkinson's disease (PD) dopamine OFF-state scalp EEG data from those of dopamine ON-state patients and healthy subjects. Unlike typical PD cortical biomarkers based on β band activity, this metric shows elevation upon dopaminergic medication in the α band. We provide evidence supporting its potential as an early-stage promising PD biomarker that can be estimated from noninvasive EEG recordings with low resolution and SNR.

Preserved perception-action integration in adolescents after a COVID-19 infection.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-40534-6	Evidence is accumulating that the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can bring forth deficits in executive functioning via alterations in the dopaminergic system. Importantly, dopaminergic pathways have been shown to modulate how actions and perceptions are integrated within the brain. Such alterations in event file binding could thus underlie the cognitive deficits developing after a COVID-19 infection. We examined action-perception integration in a group of young people (11-19 years of age) that had been infected with COVID-19 before study participation (n = 34) and compared them to a group of uninfected healthy controls (n = 29) on the behavioral (i.e., task accuracy, reaction time) and neurophysiological (EEG) level using an established event file binding paradigm. Groups did not differ from each other regarding demographic variables or in reporting psychiatric symptoms. Overall, multiple lines of evidence (behavioral and neurophysiological) suggest that action-perception integration is preserved in adolescents who suffered from COVID-19 prior to study participation. Event file binding processes were intact in both groups on all levels. While cognitive impairments can occur following a COVID-19 infection, the study demonstrates that action-perception integration as one of the basic building blocks of cognition seems to be largely unaffected in adolescents with a rather mild course of the disease.

Effects of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation on P300 magnitudes and salivary alpha-amylase during an auditory oddball task.	DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2023.108646	Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive neurostimulation technique that is thought to modulate noradrenergic activity. Previous studies have demonstrated inconsistent effects of taVNS on noradrenergic activity, which is possibly due to insufficient statistical power, suboptimal stimulation parameter settings, and data collection procedures. In this preregistered within-subject experiment, 44 healthy participants received taVNS and sham (earlobe) stimulation during two separate experimental sessions. Stimulation intensity was individually calibrated to the maximum level below pain. During each session, participants received the stimulation continuously ten minutes before an auditory novelty oddball task till the end of the experimental session. The P3b component of the event-related potential served as a marker of phasic noradrenergic activity, whereas P3a magnitude was explored as an index of dopaminergic activity. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) was measured as an index of tonic noradrenergic activity before and at the end of the stimulation. The taVNS and sham conditions did not differ in P3a or P3b magnitudes, nor sAA secretion. These findings call into question whether taVNS, administered continuously at high, nonpainful stimulation intensities, reliably augments noradrenergic activity via the vagus nerve.

Decreased Default Mode Network Connectivity Following 24 Hours of Capsaicin-induced Pain Persists During Immediate Pain Relief and Facilitation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpain.2022.12.004	Prolonged experimental pain models can help assess cortical mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain such as resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), especially in early stages. This crossover study determined the effects of 24-hour-capsaicin-induced pain on the default mode network rsFC, a major network in the dynamic pain connectome. Electroencephalographic rsFC measured by Granger causality was acquired from 24 healthy volunteers (12 women) at baseline, 1hour, and 24hours following the application of a control or capsaicin patch on the right forearm. The control patch was received maximum 1 week before the capsaicin patch. Following 24hours, the patch was cooled and later heated to assess rsFC changes in response to pain relief and facilitation, respectively. Compared to baseline, decreased rsFC at alpha oscillations (8-10Hz) was found following 1hour and 24hours of capsaicin application for connections projecting from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and right angular gyrus (rAG) but not left angular gyrus (lAG) or posterior cingulate cortex (PCC): mPFC-PCC (1hour:P < .001, 24hours:P = .002), mPFC-rAG (1hour:P < .001, 24hours:P = .001), rAG-mPFC (1hour:P < .001, 24hours:P = .001), rAG-PCC (1hour:P < .001, 24hours:P = .004). Comparable decreased rsFC following 1hour and 24hours (P≤0.008) was found at beta oscillations, however, decreased projections from PCC were also found: PCC-rAG (P≤0.005) and PCC-lAG (P≤0.006). Pain NRS scores following 24hours (3.7±0.4) was reduced by cooling (0.3±0.1, P = .004) and increased by heating (4.8±0.6, P = .016). However, neither cooling nor heating altered rsFC. This study shows that 24hours of experimental pain induces a robust decrease in DMN connectivity that persists during pain relief or facilitation suggesting a possible shift to attentional and emotional processing in persistent pain. PERSPECTIVE: This article shows decreased DMN connectivity that might reflect possible attentional and emotional changes during acute and prolonged pain. Understanding these changes could potentially help clinicians in developing therapeutic methods that can better target these attentional and emotional processes before developing into more persistent states.

Multifocal tDCS Targeting the Motor Network Modulates Event-Related Cortical Responses During Prolonged Pain.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpain.2022.09.010	Multifocal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting several brain regions is promising for inducing cortical plasticity. It remains unknown whether multifocal tDCS aimed at the resting-state motor network (network-tDCS) can revert N2-P2 cortical responses otherwise attenuated during prolonged experimental pain. Thirty-eight healthy subjects participated in 2 sessions separated by 24 hours (Day1, Day2) of active (n = 19) or sham (n = 19) network-tDCS. Experimental pain induced by topical capsaicin was maintained for 24 hours and assessed using a numerical rating scale. Electrical detection and pain thresholds, and N2-P2 evoked potentials (electroencephalography) to noxious electrical stimulation were recorded before capsaicin-induced pain (Day1-baseline), after capsaicin application (Day1-post-cap), and after 2 sessions of network-tDCS (Day2). Capsaicin induced moderate pain at Day1-post-cap, which further increased at Day2 in both groups (P = .01). Electrical detection/pain thresholds did not change over time. N2-P2 responses were reduced on Day1-post-cap compared to Day1-baseline (P = .019). At Day2 compared with Day1-post-cap, N2-P2 responses were significantly higher in the Active network-tDCS group (P<.05), while the sham group remained inhibited. These results suggest that tDCS targeting regions associated with the motor network may modulate the late evoked brain responses to noxious peripheral stimulation otherwise initially inhibited by capsaicin-induced pain. PERSPECTIVE: This study extends the evidence of N2-P2 reduction due to capsaicin-induced pain from 30 minutes to 24 hrs. Moreover, 2 sessions of tDCS targeting the motor network in the early stage of nociceptive pain may revert the inhibition of N2-P2 associated with capsaicin-induced pain.

Altered performance monitoring in Tourette Syndrome: an MEG investigation.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-022-12156-x	The error-related negativity (ERN) is an event-related potential component indexing processes of performance monitoring during simple stimulus-response tasks: the ERN is typically enhanced for error processing and conflicting response representations. Investigations in healthy participants and different patient groups have linked the ERN to the dopamine system and to prefrontal information processing. As in patients with Tourette Syndrome (TS) both dopamine release and prefrontal information processing are impaired, we hypothesized that performance monitoring would be altered, which was investigated with magnetencephalography (MEG). We examined performance monitoring in TS patients by assessing the magnetic equivalent of the ERN (mERN). The mERN was investigated in tic-free trials of eight adult, unmedicated TS patients without clinically significant comorbidity and ten matched healthy controls while performing a Go/NoGo task in selected frontocentral channels. The analysis of the response-related amplitudes of the event-related magnetic field showed that TS patients, in contrast to controls, did not show earlier amplitude modulation (between 70 and 105 ms after response onset) depending on response type (errors or correct responses). In both groups significant mERN amplitudes in the time-window between 105 and 160 ms after response onset were detected thus pointing at only later error processing in TS patients. In TS patients, early error-related processing might be affected by an enhanced motor control triggered by a conflict between the targeted high task performance and tic suppression. TS patients seem to tend to initially process all responses as erroneous responses.

Continuous but not intermittent theta burst stimulation decreases striatal dopamine release and cortical excitability.	DOI: 10.1016/j.expneurol.2022.114106	Dopamine modulation is thought to underpin some of the therapeutic effects associated with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). However, patient studies have failed to demonstrate consistent changes in the dopamine system in vivo after a therapeutic course of rTMS. Here, we evaluated acute and chronic changes in striatal dopamine release elicited by a clinically relevant course of theta burst (TBS) or sham stimulation using [11C]raclopride in healthy non-human primates (n = 11). Subjects were scanned immediately after the first session of TBS and the day after a 3 week course of daily TBS delivery. After experiment completion, animals were euthanized, and immunofluorescence staining was carried out using antibodies targeting D2 receptors (D2R). Continuous TBS (cTBS, an inhibitory form of rTMS) over the left primary motor cortex acutely decreased dopamine release bilaterally in the putamen. However, no significant changes in dopamine receptors nor D2R immunoreactivity were noted 24 h after the last stimulation, while a decrease in cortical excitability, as measured by an increase in resting motor threshold, could still be quantified. On the opposite, intermittent TBS (iTBS, an excitatory form of rTMS) did not affect dopamine release, acutely or chronically, D2R immunoreactivity or cortical excitability. These findings suggest that the long-term therapeutic effects of TBS might be facilitated through the modulation of different neurotransmission systems beyond the dopamine system. However, given the small sample size, these results should be interpreted with caution.

Effect of Levodopa Medication on Human Brain Connectome in Parkinson's Disease-A Combined Graph Theory and EEG Study.	DOI: 10.1177/15500594221085552	Background. Levodopa-based drugs are widely used for mitigating the complications induced by Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the positive effects, several issues regarding the way that levodopa changes brain activities have remained unclear. Methods. A combined strategy using EEG data and graph theory was used for investigating how levodopa changed connectome and processing hubs of the brain during resting-state. Obtained results were subjected to ANOVA test and multiple-comparison post-hoc correction procedure. Results. Outcomes showed that graph topology was not significantly different between PD and healthy groups during the eyes-closed condition, while in the eyes-open condition, statistically significant differences were found. The main effect of levodopa medication was observed for gamma-band activity in which levodopa changed the brain connectome toward a star-like topology. Considering the beta subband of EEG data, graph leaf number increased following levodopa medication in PD patients. Enhanced brain connectivity in the gamma band and reduced beta band connections in the basal ganglia were also observed after levodopa medication. Furthermore, source localization using dipole fitting showed that levodopa suppressed the activity of collateral trigone. Conclusion. Our combined EEG and graph analysis showed that levodopa medication changed the brain connectome, especially in the high-frequency range of brain electrical activities (beta and gamma).

Modulation of dopamine tone induces frequency shifts in cortico-basal ganglia beta oscillations.	DOI: 10.1038/s41467-021-27375-5	Βeta oscillatory activity (human: 13-35 Hz; primate: 8-24 Hz) is pervasive within the cortex and basal ganglia. Studies in Parkinson's disease patients and animal models suggest that beta-power increases with dopamine depletion. However, the exact relationship between oscillatory power, frequency and dopamine tone remains unclear. We recorded neural activity in the cortex and basal ganglia of healthy non-human primates while acutely and chronically up- and down-modulating dopamine levels. We assessed changes in beta oscillations in patients with Parkinson's following acute and chronic changes in dopamine tone. Here we show beta oscillation frequency is strongly coupled with dopamine tone in both monkeys and humans. Power, coherence between single-units and local field potentials (LFP), spike-LFP phase-locking, and phase-amplitude coupling are not systematically regulated by dopamine levels. These results demonstrate that beta frequency is a key property of pathological oscillations in cortical and basal ganglia networks.

Null effects of levodopa on reward- and error-based motor adaptation, savings, and anterograde interference.	DOI: 10.1152/jn.00696.2020	Dopamine signaling is thought to mediate reward-based learning. We tested for a role of dopamine in motor adaptation by administering the dopamine precursor levodopa to healthy participants in two experiments involving reaching movements. Levodopa has been shown to impair reward-based learning in cognitive tasks. Thus, we hypothesized that levodopa would selectively impair aspects of motor adaptation that depend on the reinforcement of rewarding actions. In the first experiment, participants performed two separate tasks in which adaptation was driven either by visual error-based feedback of the hand position or binary reward feedback. We used EEG to measure event-related potentials evoked by task feedback. We hypothesized that levodopa would specifically diminish adaptation and the neural responses to feedback in the reward learning task. However, levodopa did not affect motor adaptation in either task nor did it diminish event-related potentials elicited by reward outcomes. In the second experiment, participants learned to compensate for mechanical force field perturbations applied to the hand during reaching. Previous exposure to a particular force field can result in savings during subsequent adaptation to the same force field or interference during adaptation to an opposite force field. We hypothesized that levodopa would diminish savings and anterograde interference, as previous work suggests that these phenomena result from a reinforcement learning process. However, we found no reliable effects of levodopa. These results suggest that reward-based motor adaptation, savings, and interference may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms that have been shown to be disrupted by levodopa during various cognitive tasks.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Motor adaptation relies on multiple processes including reinforcement of successful actions. Cognitive reinforcement learning is impaired by levodopa-induced disruption of dopamine function. We administered levodopa to healthy adults who participated in multiple motor adaptation tasks. We found no effects of levodopa on any component of motor adaptation. This suggests that motor adaptation may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms as cognitive forms or reinforcement learning that have been shown to be impaired by levodopa.

Effect of levodopa on electroencephalographic biomarkers of the parkinsonian state.	DOI: 10.1152/jn.00141.2019	The objective of this study was to evaluate proposed electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD) and test their correlation with motor impairment in a new, well-characterized cohort of PD patients and controls. Sixty-four-channel EEG was recorded from 14 patients with rigid-akinetic PD with minimal tremor and from 14 age-matched healthy controls at rest and during voluntary movement. Patients were tested off and on medication during a single session. Recordings were analyzed for phase-amplitude coupling over sensorimotor cortex and for pairwise coherence from all electrode pairs in the recording montage (distributed coherence). Phase-amplitude coupling and distributed coherence were found to be elevated Off compared with On levodopa, and their reduction was correlated with motor improvement. In the Off medication state, phase-amplitude coupling was greater in sensorimotor contacts contralateral to the most affected body part and reduced by voluntary movement. We conclude that phase-amplitude coupling and distributed coherence are cortical biomarkers of the parkinsonian state that are detectable noninvasively and may be useful as objective aids for management of dopaminergic therapy. Several analytic methods may be used for noninvasive measurement of abnormal brain synchronization in PD. Calculation of phase-amplitude coupling requires only a single electrode over motor cortex. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Several EEG biomarkers of the parkinsonian state have been proposed that are related to abnormal cortical synchronization. We report several new findings in this study: correlations of EEG markers of synchronization with specific motor signs of Parkinson's disease (PD), and demonstration that one of the EEG markers, phase-amplitude coupling, is more elevated over the more clinically affected brain hemisphere. These findings underscore the potential utility of scalp EEG for objective, noninvasive monitoring of medication state in PD.

Attenuated beta rebound to proprioceptive afferent feedback in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-39204-3	Motor symptoms are defining traits in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). A crucial component in motor function is the integration of afferent proprioceptive sensory feedback. Previous studies have indicated abnormal movement-related cortical oscillatory activity in PD, but the role of the proprioceptive afference on abnormal oscillatory activity in PD has not been elucidated. We examine the cortical oscillations in the mu/beta-band (8-30 Hz) in the processing of proprioceptive stimulation in PD patients, ON/OFF levodopa medication, as compared to that of healthy controls (HC). We used a proprioceptive stimulator that generated precisely controlled passive movements of the index finger and measured the induced cortical oscillatory responses following the proprioceptive stimulation using magnetoencephalography. Both PD patients and HC showed a typical beta-band desynchronization during the passive movement. However, the subsequent beta rebound after the passive movement that was almost absent in PD patients compared to HC. Furthermore, we found no difference in the degree of beta rebound attenuation between patients ON and OFF levodopa medication. The results demonstrate a disease-related deterioration in cortical processing of proprioceptive afference in PD.

Different effects of levodopa and subthalamic stimulation on emotional conflict in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.24341	Parkinson's disease impairs the decoding of emotional stimuli reflecting alterations of the limbic cortico-subcortical network. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the behavioral and electrophysiological effects of both levodopa and subthalamic stimulation on emotional processing in Parkinson's disease. Operated patients (n =16) and matched healthy subjects performed an emotional Stroop task, in which the emotion expressed by a face must be recognized while ignoring an emotional distractive word and that includes a neutral control sub-task. Patients were tested in the four possible treatment conditions (off stim/off med; on stim/off med; off stim/on med; and on stim/on med). High-resolution electroencephalography was recorded while performing the task. Patients made significantly more mistakes in facial emotion recognition than healthy subjects (p < .005). Untreated patients performed worse in the emotional trials than in the control sub-task (p < .05). Fearful faces induced significantly slower reaction times than happy faces in patients (p = .0002), but not in the healthy subjects. The emotional Stroop effect with levodopa was significantly higher than with subthalamic stimulation when fearful faces were assessed (p = .0243). Conversely, treatments did not modulate the Stroop effect of the control sub-task. EEG demonstrated that, compared with the untreated state, levodopa but not subthalamic stimulation significantly increases the amplitude of the event-related potential N170 (p = .002 vs. p = .1, respectively), an electrophysiological biomarker of early aspects of facial processing. The activity of the N170 cortical sources within the right fusiform gyrus was increased by levodopa (p < .05) but not by stimulation. While levodopa normalizes the recognition of emotional facial expression and early EEG markers of emotional processing, subthalamic stimulation does not. Thus, operated patients require dopaminergic medication in addition to stimulation to treat emotional symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Beta-band oscillations in the supplementary motor cortex are modulated by levodopa and associated with functional activity in the basal ganglia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nicl.2018.05.021	We investigated the effect of acute levodopa administration on movement-related cortical oscillations and movement velocity in Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients with PD on and off medication and age- and sex-matched healthy controls performed a ballistic upper limb flexion movement as fast and accurately as possible while cortical oscillations were recorded with high-density electroencephalography. Patients off medication were also studied using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a force control paradigm. Percent signal change of functional activity during the force control task was calculated for the putamen and subthalamic nucleus (STN) contralateral to the hand tested. We found that patients with PD off medication had an exaggerated movement-related beta-band (13-30 Hz) desynchronization in the supplementary motor area (SMA) compared to controls. In PD, spectral power in the beta-band was correlated with movement velocity. Following an acute dose of levodopa, we observed that the beta-band desynchronization in the SMA was reduced in PD, and was associated with increased movement velocity and increased voltage of agonist muscle activity. Further, using fMRI we found that the functional activity in the putamen and STN in the off medication state, was related to how responsive that cortical oscillations in the SMA of PD were to levodopa. Collectively, these findings provide the first direct evaluation of how movement-related cortical oscillations relate to movement velocity during the ballistic phase of movement in PD and demonstrate that functional brain activity in the basal ganglia pathways relate to the effects of dopaminergic medication on cortical neuronal oscillations during movement.

Levodopa Reduces the Phase lag Index of Parkinson's Disease Patients: A Magnetoencephalographic Study.	DOI: 10.1177/1550059418781693	Objectives. As a method of measuring the phase difference between 2 signals, the phase lag index (PLI) of the alpha and beta bands in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) was investigated by using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Methods. Eighteen PD patients were measured by MEG in the state of overnight withdrawal of levodopa and after levodopa treatment; meanwhile, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III scale was evaluated. Results. Compared with healthy controls, alpha (8-13 Hz) PLI in the frontal and parietal areas elevated in PD patients, while the elevation was reversed by the levodopa treatment. The alterations of the UPDRS III total scale (rs = 0.552, P = .013, n = 16) and the changes of akinesia scale (rs = 0.622, P = .005, n = 16) were correlated to the change of beta (13-30 Hz) PLI in the left parietal area. The change of the UPDRS total scale was negatively correlated to duration of disease (rs = 0.432, P = .047, n = 16). There was a negative correlation between the age of PD patients and the change of alpha PLI in the left frontal area (rs = 0.519, P = .020, n = 16). Conclusions. PD patients showed a higher mu PLI in the sensorimotor area relative to the healthy controls. The improvement of motor symptoms of PD patients by levodopa was correlated to the inhibition of beta PLI in the sensorimotor area.

COMT and the neurogenetic architecture of hearing loss induced tinnitus.	DOI: 10.1016/j.heares.2018.05.020	As the COMT polymorphism is especially prominent in the prefrontal cortex and has been associated with auditory gating, we hypothesize that tinnitus patients with this polymorphism have altered activity in the ventromedial prefrontal/anterior cingulate areas that modulates the tinnitus percept. To test this, we recruited a total of 40 tinnitus subjects and 20 healthy controls for an EEG study. A comparison between tinnitus subjects and healthy controls and their frequency of being Val/Val genotype or Met carriers (including Val/Met and Met/Met genotype) shows no significant effect, suggesting that the distributions for the tinnitus and healthy groups are similar. Our results show that an interaction between the amount of hearing loss and the COMT Val158Met polymorphism can increase susceptibility to the clinical manifestation of tinnitus. We further demonstrate that the parahippocampus becomes involved in tinnitus in patients with hearing loss that are Met carriers. In these patients, the parahippocampus sends more tinnitus information to the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and auditory cortex that is specifically related with increased loudness. At the same time, the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, which normally functions as a gatekeeper, is not cancelling this auditory information, ultimately leading to increased tinnitus loudness.

Fearfulness, neuroticism/anxiety, and COMT Val158Met in long-term fear conditioning and extinction.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nlm.2018.06.001	Individual differences in long-term stability of fear memories are of potential relevance for stable dispositions related to threat processing, such as neuroticism/anxiety and fearfulness. As previous research suggests a prominent role of dopamine for the retention of conditioned and extinguished fear, dopaminergic gene polymorphisms may also relate to individual differences in fear stability. While the COMT Val158Met polymorphism causes individual differences in prefrontal dopamine, its associations with human long-term fear extinction are currently unknown. Here, n = 30/29/28 healthy male Val/Val, Val/Met and Met/Met carriers, respectively, underwent a two-day differential conditioning paradigm with fear acquisition and extinction on Day 1 and a recall test on Day 2 with recordings of EEG and ECG. Fearfulness but not neuroticism/anxiety predicted fear bradycardia (i.e., heart period slowing) during Day 1 fear acquisition while it did not affect extinction or Day 2 fear recall. In contrast, COMT Val158Met significantly modulated Day 2 fear recall as evident in fear bradycardia and Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitudes while it did not affect Day 1 fear or extinction learning. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed that individual differences in fear bradycardia during Day 2 extinction recall depended on Day 1 extinction success. Importantly, this contingency was (a) modulated by COMT Val158Met and (b) significantly reduced in high vs. low neuroticism/anxiety. The present study indicates that (a) individual differences in dopaminergic genotypes may affect the long-term stability of fear memories and (b) fearfulness vs. neuroticism/anxiety might play distinct roles in initial fear reactions vs. long-term stability of fear memories, respectively.

Dopamine substitution alters effective connectivity of cortical prefrontal, premotor, and motor regions during complex bimanual finger movements in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.04.030	Bimanual coordination is impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD), affecting patients' quality of life. Besides dysfunction of the basal ganglia network, alterations of cortical oscillatory coupling, particularly between prefrontal and (pre-)motoric areas, are thought to underlie this impairment. Here, we studied 16 PD patients OFF and ON medication and age-matched healthy controls recording high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) during performance of spatially coupled and uncoupled bimanual finger movements. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for induced responses was used to infer task-induced effective connectivity within a network comprising bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), lateral premotor cortex (lPM), supplementary motor area (SMA), and primary motor cortex (M1). Performing spatially coupled movements, excitatory left-hemispheric PFC to lPM coupling was significantly stronger in controls compared to unmedicated PD patients. Levodopa-induced enhancement of this connection correlated with increased movement accuracy. During performance of spatially uncoupled movements, PD patients OFF medication exhibited inhibitory connectivity from left PFC to SMA. Levodopa intake diminished these inhibitory influences and restored excitatory PFC to lPM coupling. This restoration, however, did not improve motor function. Concluding, our results indicate that lateralization of prefrontal to premotor connectivity in PD can be augmented by levodopa substitution and is of compensatory nature up to a certain extent of complexity.

However, the mechanisms of such abnormalities are not fully understood. Here, we aimed to investigate whether kinematic abnormalities are related to cortical participation during bilateral, cyclical ankle movements, which required i) maintenance of a specific frequency and ii) bilateral coordination of the lower limbs in an anti-phasic manner. We analyzed electroencephalographic and electromyographic signals from nine men with PD and nine aged-matched healthy men while they sat and cyclically dorsi- and plantarflexed their feet. This movement was performed at a similar cadence to normal walking under two conditions: i) self-paced and ii) externally paced by a metronome. Participants with PD exhibited reduced range of motion and more variable bilateral coordination. However, participants with and without PD did not differ in the magnitude of corticomuscular coherence between the midline cortical areas and tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles. This finding suggests that either the kinematic abnormalities were related to processes outside linear corticomuscular communication or PD-related changes in neural correlates maintained corticomuscular communication but not motor performance.

Dopamine and response selection: an Acute Phenylalanine/Tyrosine Depletion study.	DOI: 10.1007/s00213-018-4846-3	The role of dopaminergic system in decision-making is well documented, and evidence suggests that it could play a significant role in response selection processes. The N-40 is a fronto-central event-related potential, generated by the supplementary motor areas (SMAs) and a physiological index of response selection processes. The aim of the present study was to determine whether infraclinical effects of dopamine depletion on response selection processes could be evidenced via alterations of the N-40. We obtained a dopamine depletion in healthy volunteers with the acute phenylalanine and tyrosine depletion (APTD) method which consists in decreasing the availability of dopamine precursors. Subjects realized a Simon task in the APTD condition and in the control condition. When the stimulus was presented on the same side as the required response, the stimulus-response association was congruent and when the stimulus was presented on the opposite side of the required response, the stimulus-response association was incongruent. The N-40 was smaller for congruent associations than for incongruent associations. Moreover, the N-40 was sensitive to the level of dopaminergic activity with a decrease in APTD condition compared to control condition. This modulation of the N-40 by dopaminergic level could not be explained by a global decrease of cerebral electrogenesis, since negativities and positivities indexing the recruitment of the primary motor cortex (anatomically adjacent to the SMA) were unaffected by APTD. The specific sensitivity of N-40 to ATPD supports the model of Keeler et al. (Neuroscience 282:156-175, 2014) according to which the dopaminergic system is involved in response selection.

Human subthalamic nucleus - Automatic auditory change detection as a basis for action selection.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2017.05.008	The subthalamic nucleus (STN) shapes motor behavior and is important for the initiation and termination of movements. Here we ask whether the STN takes aggregated sensory information into account, in order to exert this function. To this end, local field potentials (LFP) were recorded in eight patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and receiving deep-brain stimulation of the STN bilaterally. Bipolar recordings were obtained postoperatively from the externalized electrode leads. Patients were passively exposed to trains of auditory stimuli containing global deviants, local deviants or combined global/local deviants. The surface event-related potentials of the Parkinson's patients as well as those of 19 age-matched healthy controls were characterized by a mismatch negativity (MMN) that was most pronounced for the global/local double deviants and less prominent for the other deviant conditions. The left and right STN LFPs similarly were modulated by stimulus deviance starting at about 100ms post-stimulus onset. The MMN has been viewed as an index of an automatic auditory change detection system, more recently phrased in terms of predictive coding theory, which prepares the organism for attention shifts and for action. The LFP-data from the STN clearly demonstrate that the STN receives information on stimulus deviance, possibly as a means to bias the system to interrupt ongoing and to allow alternative actions.

Functional Polymorphisms in Dopaminergic Genes Modulate Neurobehavioral and Neurophysiological Consequences of Sleep Deprivation.	DOI: 10.1038/srep45982	Sleep deprivation impairs cognitive performance and reliably alters brain activation in wakefulness and sleep. Nevertheless, the molecular regulators of prolonged wakefulness remain poorly understood. Evidence from genetic, behavioral, pharmacologic and imaging studies suggest that dopaminergic signaling contributes to the behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) consequences of sleep loss, although direct human evidence thereof is missing. We tested whether dopamine neurotransmission regulate sustained attention and evolution of EEG power during prolonged wakefulness. Here, we studied the effects of functional genetic variation in the dopamine transporter (DAT1) and the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) genes, on psychomotor performance and standardized waking EEG oscillations during 40 hours of wakefulness in 64 to 82 healthy volunteers. Sleep deprivation consistently enhanced sleepiness, lapses of attention and the theta-to-alpha power ratio (TAR) in the waking EEG. Importantly, DAT1 and DRD2 genotypes distinctly modulated sleep loss-induced changes in subjective sleepiness, PVT lapses and TAR, according to inverted U-shaped relationships. Together, the data suggest that genetically determined differences in DAT1 and DRD2 expression modulate functional consequences of sleep deprivation, supporting the hypothesis that striato-thalamo-cortical dopaminergic pathways modulate the neurobehavioral and neurophysiological consequences of sleep loss in humans.

COMT and DRD2/ANKK-1 gene-gene interaction account for resetting of gamma neural oscillations to auditory stimulus-driven attention.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0172362	Attention capture by potentially relevant environmental stimuli is critical for human survival, yet it varies considerably among individuals. A large series of studies has suggested that attention capture may depend on the cognitive balance between maintenance and manipulation of mental representations and the flexible switch between goal-directed representations and potentially relevant stimuli outside the focus of attention; a balance that seems modulated by a prefrontostriatal dopamine pathway. Here, we examined inter-individual differences in the cognitive control of attention through studying the effects of two single nucleotide polymorphisms regulating dopamine at the prefrontal cortex and the striatum (i.e., COMTMet108/158Val and ANKK1/DRD2TaqIA) on stimulus-driven attention capture. Healthy adult participants (N = 40) were assigned to different groups according to the combination of the polymorphisms COMTMet108/158Val and ANKK1/DRD2TaqIA, and were instructed to perform on a well-established distraction protocol. Performance in individuals with a balance between prefrontal dopamine display and striatal receptor density was slowed down by the occurrence of unexpected distracting events, while those with a rather unbalanced dopamine activity were able maintain task performance with no time delay, yet at the expense of a slightly lower accuracy. This advantage, associated to their distinct genetic profiles, was paralleled by an electrophysiological mechanism of phase-resetting of gamma neural oscillation to the novel, distracting events. Taken together, the current results suggest that the epistatic interaction between COMTVal108/158Met and ANKK1/DRD2 TaqIa genetic polymorphisms lies at the basis of stimulus-driven attention capture.

Unravelling the effect of experimental pain on the corticomotor system using transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography.	DOI: 10.1007/s00221-017-4880-0	The interaction between pain and the motor system is well-known, with past studies showing that pain can alter corticomotor excitability and have deleterious effects on motor learning. The aim of this study was to better understand the cortical mechanisms underlying the interaction between pain and the motor system. Experimental pain was induced on 19 young and healthy participants using capsaicin cream, applied on the middle volar part of the left forearm. The effect of pain on brain activity and on the corticomotor system was assessed with electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), respectively. Compared to baseline, resting state brain activity significantly increased after capsaicin application in the central cuneus (theta frequency), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (alpha frequency), and left cuneus and right insula (beta frequency). A pain-evoked increase in the right primary motor cortex (M1) activity was also observed (beta frequency), but only among participants who showed a reduction in corticospinal output (as depicted by TMS recruitment curves). These participants further showed greater beta M1-cuneus connectivity than the other participants. These findings indicate that pain-evoked increases in M1 beta power are intimately tied to changes in the corticospinal system, and provide evidence that beta M1-cuneus connectivity is related to the corticomotor alterations induced by pain. The differential pattern of response observed in our participants suggest that the effect of pain on the motor system is variable from on individual to another; an observation that could have important clinical implications for rehabilitation professionals working with pain patients.

Dopaminergic modulation of performance monitoring in Parkinson's disease: An event-related potential study.	DOI: 10.1038/srep41222	"Monitoring one's actions is essential for goal-directed performance. In the event-related potential (ERP), errors are followed by fronto-centrally distributed negativities. These error(-related) negativity (Ne/ERN) amplitudes are often found to be attenuated in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to healthy controls (HC). Although Ne/ERN has been proposed to be related to dopaminergic neuronal activity, previous research did not find evidence for effects of dopaminergic medication on Ne/ERN amplitudes in PD. We examined 13 PD patients ""on"" and ""off"" dopaminergic medication. Their response-locked ERP amplitudes (obtained on correct [Nc/CRN] and error [Ne/ERN] trials of a flanker task) were compared to those of 13 HC who were tested twice as well, without receiving dopaminergic medication. While PD patients committed more errors than HC, error rates were not significantly modulated by dopaminergic medication. PD patients showed reduced Ne/ERN amplitudes relative to HC; however, this attenuation of response-locked ERP amplitudes was not specific to errors in this study. PD-related attenuation of response-locked ERP amplitudes was most pronounced when PD patients were on medication. These results suggest overdosing of dopaminergic pathways that are relatively spared in PD, but that are related to the generation of the Ne/ERN, notably pathways targeted on the medial prefrontal cortex."

Paradoxical facilitation after depotentiation protocol can precede dyskinesia onset in early Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1007/s00221-016-4759-5	Loss of dopamine, a key modulator of synaptic signalling, and subsequent pulsatile non-physiological levodopa replacement is believed to underlie altered neuroplasticity in Parkinson's disease (PD). Animal models suggest that maladaptive plasticity (e.g. deficient depotentiation at corticostriatal synapses) is key in the development of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), a common complication following levodopa replacement in PD. Human studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols have shown similar depotentiation deficit in patients with LID. We hypothesized that subtle depotentiation deficits should precede LID if these deficits are mechanistically linked to LID onset. Moreover, patients on pulsatile levodopa-based therapy may show these changes earlier than those treated with levodopa-sparing strategies. We recruited 22 early non-dyskinetic PD patients (<5 years since diagnosis) and 12 age-matched healthy controls. We grouped patients into those on Levodopa-Based (n = 11) and Levodopa-Sparing therapies (n = 11). Patients were selected to obtain groups matched for age and disease severity. We used a theta-burst stimulation protocol to investigate potentiation and depotentiation in a single session. We report significant depotentiation deficits in the Levodopa-Based group, compared to both Levodopa-Sparing and Healthy Control groups. Potentiation and Depotentiation responses were similar between Levodopa-Sparing and Healthy Control groups. Although differences persist after accounting for potential confounds (e.g. levodopa-equivalent dose), these results may yet be caused by differences in disease severity and cumulative levodopa-equivalent dose as discussed in the text. In conclusion, we show for the first time that paradoxical facilitation in response to depotentiation protocols can occur in PD even prior to LID onset.

Sparse pallidal connections shape synchrony in a network model of the basal ganglia.	DOI: 10.1111/ejn.13324	Neural synchrony in the basal ganglia, especially in the beta frequency band (13-30 Hz), is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and considered as antikinetic. In contrast, the healthy basal ganglia show low levels of synchrony. It is currently unknown where synchrony and oscillations arise in the parkinsonian brain and how they are transmitted through the basal ganglia, as well as what makes them dependent on dopamine. The external part of the globus pallidus has recently been identified as a hub nucleus in the basal ganglia, possessing intrinsic inhibitory connections and possibly also gap junctions. In this study, we show that in a conductance-based network model of the basal ganglia, the combination of sparse, high-conductance inhibitory synapses and sparse, low-conductance gap junctions in the external part of the globus pallidus could effectively desynchronize the whole network. However, when gap junction coupling became strong enough, the effect was impeded and activity synchronized. In particular, sustained periods of beta coherence occurred between some neuron pairs. As gap junctions can change their conductance with the dopamine level, we suggest pallidal gap junction coupling as a mechanism contributing to the development of beta synchrony in the parkinsonian basal ganglia.

Different relationships between central dopamine system and sub-processes of inhibition: Spontaneous eye blink rate relates with N2 but not P3 in a Go/Nogo task.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bandc.2016.04.003	Clinical studies show that dysfunction of the dopamine (DA) system could differently modulate N2 and P3 components in a Go/Nogo task, a classical inhibition task. However, results of previous clinical studies cannot be arbitrarily generalized to healthy adults. Thus, the present exploratory study aimed to investigate whether there are significant and variable relationships between individual differences of the DA system in normal healthy persons and N2- and P3-related sub-processes of inhibition in a Go/Nogo task. DA function was measured by spontaneous eye blink rate (EBR), which is an effective clinical and non-invasive measure and strongly related to the activity of the central dopaminergic system. A total of 28 young adults participated in this experiment. Results showed that Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3 of all participants were larger than Go-N2 and Go-P3, while Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3 were significantly related with Nogo-accuracy. Moreover, it was shown that higher EBRs were significantly correlated with larger and more negative N2 amplitudes under Go- and Nogo-conditions; however, there were no significant correlations between participants' EBRs and N2 latencies, and between EBRs and average amplitudes of P3 under the two conditions. Based on these results, we concluded that the central DA system was associated with the N2-related conflict monitoring rather than P3-related sub-process of inhibition.

Brain potentials evoked by intraepidermal electrical stimuli reflect the central sensitization of nociceptive pathways.	DOI: 10.1152/jn.00013.2016	Central sensitization (CS), the increased sensitivity of the central nervous system to somatosensory inputs, accounts for secondary hyperalgesia, a typical sign of several painful clinical conditions. Brain potentials elicited by mechanical punctate stimulation using flat-tip probes can provide neural correlates of CS, but their signal-to-noise ratio is limited by poor synchronization of the afferent nociceptive input. Additionally, mechanical punctate stimulation does not activate nociceptors exclusively. In contrast, low-intensity intraepidermal electrical stimulation (IES) allows selective activation of type II Aδ-mechano-heat nociceptors (II-AMHs) and elicits reproducible brain potentials. However, it is unclear whether hyperalgesia from IES occurs and coexists with secondary mechanical punctate hyperalgesia, and whether the magnitude of the electroencephalographic (EEG) responses evoked by IES within the hyperalgesic area is increased. To address these questions, we explored the modulation of the psychophysical and EEG responses to IES by intraepidermal injection of capsaicin in healthy human subjects. We obtained three main results. First, the intensity of the sensation elicited by IES was significantly increased in participants who developed robust mechanical punctate hyperalgesia after capsaicin injection (i.e., responders), indicating that hyperalgesia from IES coexists with punctate mechanical hyperalgesia. Second, the N2 peak magnitude of the EEG responses elicited by IES was significantly increased after the intraepidermal injection of capsaicin in responders only. Third, a receiver-operator characteristics analysis showed that the N2 peak amplitude is clearly predictive of the presence of CS. These findings suggest that the EEG responses elicited by IES reflect secondary hyperalgesia and therefore represent an objective correlate of CS.

The Roles of Dopamine and Hypocretin in Reward: A Electroencephalographic Study.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0142432	The proper functioning of the mesolimbic reward system is largely dependent on the neurotransmitter dopamine. Recent evidence suggests that the hypocretin system has significant projections to this reward system. We examined the distinct effects of reduced dopamine or reduced hypocretin levels on reward activity in patients with Parkinson's disease, dopamine deficient, as well as patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy, hypocretin depleted, and healthy controls. Participants performed a simple game-like task while high-density electroencephalography was recorded. Topography and timing of event-related potentials for both reward cue, and reward feedback was examined across the entire dataset. While response to reward cue was similar in all groups, two distinct time points were found to distinguish patients and controls for reward feedback. Around 160 ms both patient groups had reduced ERP amplitude compared to controls. Later at 250 ms, both patient groups also showed a clear event-related potential (ERP), which was absent in controls. The initial differences show that both patient groups show a similar, blunted response to reward delivery. The second potential corresponds to the classic feedback-related negativity (FRN) potential which relies on dopamine activity and reflects reward prediction-error signaling. In particular the mismatch between predicted reward and reward subsequently received was significantly higher in PD compared to NC, independent of reward magnitude and valence. The intermediate FRN response in NC highlights the contribution of hypocretin in reward processing, yet also shows that this is not as detrimental to the reward system as in Parkinson's. Furthermore, the inability to generate accurate predictions in NC may explain why hypocretin deficiency mediates cataplexy triggered by both positive and negative emotions.

Predictive timing functions of cortical beta oscillations are impaired in Parkinson's disease and influenced by L-DOPA and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nicl.2015.09.013	Cortex-basal ganglia circuits participate in motor timing and temporal perception, and are important for the dynamic configuration of sensorimotor networks in response to exogenous demands. In Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) induces motor performance benefits. Hitherto, little is known concerning contributions of the basal ganglia to sensory facilitation and cortical responses to RAS in PD. Therefore, we conducted an EEG study in 12 PD patients before and after surgery for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and in 12 age-matched controls. Here we investigated the effects of levodopa and STN-DBS on resting-state EEG and on the cortical-response profile to slow and fast RAS in a passive-listening paradigm focusing on beta-band oscillations, which are important for auditory-motor coupling. The beta-modulation profile to RAS in healthy participants was characterized by local peaks preceding and following auditory stimuli. In PD patients RAS failed to induce pre-stimulus beta increases. The absence of pre-stimulus beta-band modulation may contribute to impaired rhythm perception in PD. Moreover, post-stimulus beta-band responses were highly abnormal during fast RAS in PD patients. Treatment with levodopa and STN-DBS reinstated a post-stimulus beta-modulation profile similar to controls, while STN-DBS reduced beta-band power in the resting-state. The treatment-sensitivity of beta oscillations suggests that STN-DBS may specifically improve timekeeping functions of cortical beta oscillations during fast auditory pacing.

Characterizing pinprick-evoked brain potentials before and after experimentally induced secondary hyperalgesia.	DOI: 10.1152/jn.00444.2015	"Secondary hyperalgesia is believed to be a key feature of ""central sensitization"" and is characterized by enhanced pain to mechanical nociceptive stimuli. The aim of the present study was to characterize, using EEG, the effects of pinprick stimulation intensity on the magnitude of pinprick-elicited brain potentials [event-related potentials (ERPs)] before and after secondary hyperalgesia induced by intradermal capsaicin in humans. Pinprick-elicited ERPs and pinprick-evoked pain ratings were recorded in 19 healthy volunteers, with mechanical pinprick stimuli of varying intensities (0.25-mm probe applied with a force extending between 16 and 512 mN). The recordings were performed before (T0) and 30 min after (T1) intradermal capsaicin injection. The contralateral noninjected arm served as control. ERPs elicited by stimulation of untreated skin were characterized by 1) an early-latency negative-positive complex peaking between 120 and 250 ms after stimulus onset (N120-P240) and maximal at the vertex and 2) a long-lasting positive wave peaking 400-600 ms after stimulus onset and maximal more posterior (P500), which was correlated to perceived pinprick pain. After capsaicin injection, pinprick stimuli were perceived as more intense in the area of secondary hyperalgesia and this effect was stronger for lower compared with higher stimulus intensities. In addition, there was an enhancement of the P500 elicited by stimuli of intermediate intensity, which was significant for 64 mN. The other components of the ERPs were unaffected by capsaicin. Our results suggest that the increase in P500 magnitude after capsaicin is mediated by facilitated mechanical nociceptive pathways."

COMT polymorphism modulates the resting-state EEG alpha oscillatory response to acute nicotine in male non-smokers.	DOI: 10.1111/gbb.12226	Performance improvements in cognitive tasks requiring executive functions are evident with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists, and activation of the underlying neural circuitry supporting these cognitive effects is thought to involve dopamine neurotransmission. As individual difference in response to nicotine may be related to a functional polymorphism in the gene encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that strongly influences cortical dopamine metabolism, this study examined the modulatory effects of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism on the neural response to acute nicotine as measured with resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations. In a sample of 62 healthy non-smoking adult males, a single dose (6 mg) of nicotine gum administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design was shown to affect α oscillatory activity, increasing power of upper α oscillations in frontocentral regions of Met/Met homozygotes and in parietal/occipital regions of Val/Met heterozygotes. Peak α frequency was also found to be faster with nicotine (vs. placebo) treatment in Val/Met heterozygotes, who exhibited a slower α frequency compared to Val/Val homozygotes. The data tentatively suggest that interindividual differences in brain α oscillations and their response to nicotinic agonist treatment are influenced by genetic mechanisms involving COMT.

Dopamine precursor depletion influences pain affect rather than pain sensation.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0096167	Pain is a multidimensional experience, which includes sensory, cognitive, and affective aspects. Converging lines of evidence indicate that dopaminergic neurotransmission plays an important role in human pain perception. However, the precise effects of dopamine on different aspects of pain perception remain to be elucidated. To address this question, we experimentally decreased dopaminergic neurotransmission in 22 healthy human subjects using Acute Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Depletion (APTD). During APTD and a control condition we applied brief painful laser stimuli to the hand, assessed different aspects of pain perception, and recorded electroencephalographic responses. APTD-induced decreases of cerebral dopaminergic activity did not influence sensory aspects of pain perception. In contrast, APTD yielded increases of pain unpleasantness. The increases of unpleasantness ratings positively correlated with effectiveness of APTD. Our finding of an influence of dopaminergic neurotransmission on affective but not sensory aspects of phasic pain suggests that analgesic effects of dopamine might be mediated by indirect effects on pain affect rather than by direct effects on ascending nociceptive signals. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex relationship between dopamine and pain perception, which may play a role in various clinical pain states.

Dopaminergic stimulation facilitates working memory and differentially affects prefrontal low theta oscillations.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.03.011	We used electroencephalography (EEG) together with psychopharmacological stimulation to investigate the role of dopamine in neural oscillations during working memory (WM). Following a within-subjects design, healthy humans either received the dopamine precursor L-Dopa (150 mg) or a placebo before they performed a Sternberg WM paradigm. Here, sequences of sample images had to be memorized for a delay of 5 s in three different load conditions (two, four or six items). On the next day, long-term memory (LTM) for the images was tested. Behaviorally, L-Dopa improved WM and LTM performance as a function of WM load. More precisely, there was a specific drug effect in the four-load condition with faster reaction times to the probe in the WM task and higher corrected hit-rates in the LTM task. During the maintenance period, there was a linear and quadratic effect of WM load on power in the high theta (5-8 Hz) and alpha (9-14 Hz) frequency range at frontal sensors. Importantly, a drug by load interaction--mimicking the behavioral results--was found only in low theta power (2-4 Hz). As such, our results indicate a specific link between prefrontal low theta oscillations, dopaminergic neuromodulation during WM and subsequent LTM performance.

Humor as a reward mechanism: event-related potentials in the healthy and diseased brain.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085978	Humor processing involves distinct processing stages including incongruity detection, emotional response, and engagement of mesolimbic reward regions. Dysfunctional reward processing and clinical symptoms in response to humor have been previously described in both hypocretin deficient narcolepsy-cataplexy (NC) and in idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD). For NC patients, humor is the strongest trigger for cataplexy, a transient loss of muscle tone, whereas dopamine-deficient PD-patients show blunted emotional responses to humor. To better understand the role of reward system and the various contributions of hypocretinergic and dopaminergic mechanisms to different stages of humor processing we examined the electrophysiological response to humorous and neutral pictures when given as reward feedback in PD, NC and healthy controls. Humor compared to neutral feedback demonstrated modulation of early ERP amplitudes likely corresponding to visual processing stages, with no group differences. At 270 ms post-feedback, conditions showed topographical and amplitudinal differences for frontal and left posterior electrodes, in that humor feedback was absent in PD patients but increased in NC patients. We suggest that this effect relates to a relatively early affective response, reminiscent of increased amygdala response reported in NC patients. Later ERP differences, corresponding to the late positive potential, revealed a lack of sustained activation in PD, likely due to altered dopamine regulation in reward structures in these patients. This research provides new insights into the temporal dynamics and underlying mechanisms of humor detection and appreciation in health and disease.

Levodopa reinstates connectivity from prefrontal to premotor cortex during externally paced movement in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.11.023	Dopamine deficiency affects functional integration of activity in distributed neural regions. It has been suggested that lack of dopamine induces disruption of neural interactions between prefrontal and premotor areas, which might underlie impairment of motor control observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study we recorded cortical activity with high-density electroencephalography in 11 patients with PD as a pathological model of dopamine deficiency, and 13 healthy control subjects. Participants performed repetitive extension-flexion movements of their right index finger, which were externally paced at a rate of 0.5 Hz. This required participants to align their movement velocity to the slow external pace. Patients were studied after at least 12-hour withdrawal of dopaminergic medication (OFF state) and after intake of the dopamine precursor levodopa (ON state) in order to examine oscillatory coupling between prefrontal and premotor areas during respectively low and high levels of dopamine. In 10 patients and 12 control participants multiple source beamformer analysis yielded task-related activation of a contralateral cortical network comprising prefrontal cortex (PFC), lateral premotor cortex (lPM), supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1). Dynamic causal modelling was used to characterize task-related oscillatory coupling between prefrontal and premotor cortical areas. Healthy participants showed task-induced coupling from PFC to SMA, which was modulated within the γ-band. In the OFF state, PD patients did not express any frequency-specific coupling between prefrontal and premotor areas. Application of levodopa reinstated task-related coupling from PFC to SMA, which was expressed as high-β-γ coupling. Additionally, strong within-frequency γ-coupling as well as cross-frequency θ-γ coupling was observed from PFC to lPM. Enhancement of this cross-frequency θ-γ coupling after application of levodopa was positively correlated with individual improvement in motor function. The results demonstrate that dopamine deficiency impairs the ability to establish oscillatory coupling between prefrontal and premotor areas during an externally paced motor task. Application of extrinsic dopamine in PD patients reinstates physiological prefrontal-premotor coupling and additionally induces within- and cross-frequency coupling from prefrontal to premotor areas, which is not expressed in healthy participants.

Serotonin transporter genotype (5-HTTLPR) and electrocortical responses indicating the sensitivity to negative emotional cues.	DOI: 10.1037/a0033997	Growing literature indicates that emotional reactivity and regulation are strongly linked to genetic modulation of serotonergic neurotransmission. However, until now, most studies have focused on the relationship between genotypic markers, in particular the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), and neural structures using MRI. The current study aimed to bridge the gap between the relevant MRI literature on the effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype and the research tradition focusing on transient lateralized changes of electrocortical activity in the prefrontal cortex using electroencephalography (EEG). Lateral shifts of EEG alpha asymmetry in response to an aversive film consisting of scenes of real injury and death were assessed in healthy participants (n = 165). To evaluate the specificity of the 5-HTTLPR effect, participants were also tested for the COMT Val158Met polymorphism which is linked to dopamine inactivation. While viewing the film, individuals homozygous for the 5-HTTLPR short allele displayed a clear lateral shift of dorsolateral frontal activity to the right, which was virtually absent in participants carrying the long allele. The heightened electrocortical response to the aversive stimulation and its direction indicates a greater propensity of s/s homozygotes to experience withdrawal oriented affect in response to negative emotion cues in the environment. Moreover, together with previous research the findings support the notion of a link between the serotonergic system and self-regulation related to avoidance motivation, and a link between the dopaminergic system and self-regulation related to approach motivation.

Dopamine replacement modulates oscillatory coupling between premotor and motor cortical areas in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1093/cercor/bht140	Efficient neural communication between premotor and motor cortical areas is critical for manual motor control. Here, we used high-density electroencephalography to study cortical connectivity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and age-matched healthy controls while they performed repetitive movements of the right index finger at maximal repetition rate. Multiple source beamformer analysis and dynamic causal modeling were used to assess oscillatory coupling between the lateral premotor cortex (lPM), supplementary motor area (SMA), and primary motor cortex (M1) in the contralateral hemisphere. Elderly healthy controls showed task-related modulation in connections from lPM to SMA and M1, mainly within the γ-band (>30 Hz). Nonmedicated PD patients also showed task-related γ-γ coupling from lPM to M1, but γ coupling from lPM to SMA was absent. Levodopa reinstated physiological γ-γ coupling from lPM to SMA and significantly strengthened coupling in the feedback connection from M1 to lPM expressed as β-β as well as θ-β coupling. Enhancement in cross-frequency θ-β coupling from M1 to lPM was correlated with levodopa-induced improvement in motor function. The results show that PD is associated with an altered neural communication between premotor and motor cortical areas, which can be modulated by dopamine replacement.

Auditory event-related potentials (P3a, P3b) and genetic variants within the dopamine and serotonin system in healthy females.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bbr.2013.04.013	The late positive components of the human event-related brain potential comprise electrocortical reflections of stimulus-driven attentional capture (the anteriorly distributed P3a) and top-down control detection of relevant events (the posteriorly distributed P3b). As of yet, the neuropharmacologic and neurogenetic origin of the P3a and P3b is not fully understood. In this study, we address the contribution of dopaminergic and serotoninergic mechanisms. Sixty healthy females completed an active auditory novelty oddball paradigm while EEG was recorded. In all subjects, genetic polymorphisms within the dopamine system (dopamine transporter [DAT1], catecholamine-O-methyltransferase val158met [COMT val158met]) and the serotonin system (serotonin transporter [5HTTLPR]) were assessed. Across genotypes, novels (relative to standards) elicited a fronto-centrally distributed P3a, and targets (relative to standards) a parieto-centrally distributed P3b. Genotypes effects were observed for both P3a (COMT, 5HTTPLR) and P3b (DAT1, COMT, 5HTTLPR) only at prefrontal electrode location (Fz). Specifically, the frontal P3a was enhanced in COMT met/met homozygotes, but not in DAT1 9R. The target-related P3b was enhanced in COMT met/met and DAT1 9R relative to its genetic counterparts, but only at frontal electrodes. This 'anteriorized' enhancement may reflect either an additional frontal component in the target-related P3 dependent on dopamine, or a more subtle shift in the neural ensemble that generates the target-related P3. Results for 5HTTLPR short allele homozygotes mimicked those in COMT met/met homozygotes. In all, the present findings suggest involvement of frontal-cortical dopaminergic and serotoninergic mechanisms in bottom-up attentional capture (COMT val158met, 5HTTLPR), with an additional top-down component sensitive to striatal signals (DAT1).

The effect of nerve compression and capsaicin on contact heat-evoked potentials related to Aδ- and C-fibers.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2012.07.049	Brief noxious heat stimuli activate Aδ- and C-fibers and allow contact heat-evoked potentials (CHEPs) to be recorded from the scalp. Under normal conditions, only late responses related to Aδ-fibers can be recorded. This study aimed to demonstrate C-fiber responses to contact heat stimuli. A preferential A-fiber compression blockade of the superficial radial nerve was applied in 22 healthy subjects. Quality and intensity of heat-evoked pain and CHEPs were examined at baseline, during nerve compression, and during nerve compression with simultaneous application of topical capsaicin (5%). During the A-fiber block, three subjects had CHEPs with latencies below 400 ms, eight subjects within 400-800 ms and six subjects (29%) later than 800 ms. Pain intensity to contact heat stimuli after compression was reduced and fewer subjects reported the heat stimuli as stinging. Following nerve compression and capsaicin application, ultralate CHEPs with latencies >800 ms could be recorded in 13 subjects (62%), pain intensity to the contact heat stimuli was increased and the warm/hot-burning pain quality became more intense. The main results of our study are the demonstration of ultralate C-fiber-related CHEPs following A-fiber blockade in 29% of healthy subjects increasing to 62% when the blockade was combined with capsaicin. After blockade of Aδ-fibers we recorded responses with latencies in the range between the latencies of Aδ- and C-fibers suggesting release of Aδ-fibers with slower conduction velocity than normally recorded with CHEPs.

Genetic polymorphisms of the dopamine and serotonin systems modulate the neurophysiological response to feedback and risk taking in healthy humans.	DOI: 10.3758/s13415-012-0108-8	Genetic differences in the dopamine and serotonin systems have been suggested as potential factors underlying interindividual variability in risk taking and in brain activation during the processing of feedback. Here, we studied the effects of dopaminergic (dopamine transporter [DAT1], catecholamine-O-methyltransferase val158met [COMT]) and serotonergic (serotonin transporter [5HTTLPR]) polymorphisms on risk taking and brain responses following feedback in 60 healthy female subjects. The subjects completed a well-established experimental gambling paradigm while an electroencephalogram was recorded. During the task, risk-taking behavior and prefrontal brain responses (feedback-related negativity [FRN]) following monetary gains and losses were assessed. FRN amplitudes were enhanced for nine-repeat-allele carriers of the DAT1 and short-allele carriers of 5HTTLPR, which are both presumably linked to less transporter activity and higher neurotransmitter levels. Moreover, nine-repeat DAT1 carriers displayed a trend toward increased risk taking in general, whereas 5HTTLPR short-allele carriers showed decreased risk taking following gains. COMT val158met genotype was unrelated to FRN amplitude and average risk taking. However, COMT met/met carriers showed a pronounced feedback P3 amplitude independent of valence, and a gradual increase in risk taking during the gambling task. In sum, the present findings underline the importance of genetic variability in the dopamine and serotonin systems regarding the neurophysiology of feedback processing.

COMT Val158Met genotype and the common basis of error and conflict monitoring.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2012.02.054	The present study investigated the possibility that different aspects of performance monitoring share a common dopaminergic foundation. For this purpose we analyzed the influence of the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism on electrophysiological markers of conflict and error monitoring, respectively. An EEG was recorded while 65 healthy subjects completed a response-conflict evoking task. In the event-related potential (ERP), both the conflict-N400 as well as the error-related negativity (ERN) were diminished in homozygous carriers of the Met allele. Moreover, the shared variance of both deflections was substantially explained by the COMT Val(158)Met genotype. These findings suggest that the relation between error- and conflict-related processes in the medial frontal cortex is mediated by a common molecular mechanism, namely the individual magnitude of phasic dopaminergic transmission.

The effects of catechol-O-methyl-transferase polymorphism Val158Met on functional connectivity in healthy young females: a resting EEG study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.073	The catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) gene has been linked to a wide spectrum of human phenotypes, including cognition, affective response, pain sensitivity, anxiety and psychosis. This study examined the modulatory effects of COMT Val158Met on neural interactions, indicated by connectivity strengths. Blood samples and resting state eyes-closed EEG signals were collected in 254 healthy young females. The COMT Val158Met polymorphism was decoded into 3 groups: Val/Val, Val/Met and Met/Met. The values of mutual information of 20 frontal-related channel pairs across delta, theta, alpha and beta frequencies were analyzed based on the time-frequency mutual information method. Our one-way ANOVA analyses revealed that the significant connection-frequency pairs were relatively left lateralized (P<0.01) and included F7-T3 and F7-C3 at delta frequency, and F3-F4, F7-T3, F7-C3, F7-P3, F3-C3, F3-F7 and F4-F8 at theta frequency. The F-test at F7-T3 and F7-C3 theta surpassed the statistical threshold of P<0.003 (after Bonferroni correction). For all the above connection-frequency pairs, there was a dose-dependent trend in the connectivity strengths of the alleles as follows: Val/Val>Val/Met>Met/Met. Our analyses complemented previous literature regarding neural modulation by the COMT Val158Met polymorphism. The implication to the pathogenesis in schizophrenia was also discussed. Further studies are needed to clarify whether there is gender difference on this gene-brain interaction.

COMT Val108/158Met genotype modulates human sensory gating.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.031	The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(108/158)Met polymorphism of the dopamine system is essential for prefrontal cortex processing capacity and efficiency. In addition, dopaminergic neurotransmission is also associated with the sensory gating phenomenon protecting the cerebral cortex from information overload. It is however unclear if COMT genotype as a predictor of prefrontal efficiency modulates sensory gating on the level of the auditory cortex, i.e. the gating of the auditory evoked P50 and N100 components.

Association study of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene Val158Met polymorphism with auditory P300 in Chinese Han patients with schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psychres.2008.07.008	Several studies have reported associations between catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene Val158Met polymorphism and P300 event-related potentials in schizophrenic patients. But there has been no research to study the association between the P300 component and the Val158Met polymorphism in Chinese Han schizophrenia patients. Therefore, the present article was aimed at investigating the relationship of the Val158Met polymorphism with P300 in Chinese schizophrenic patients. The Val158Met polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 287 schizophrenia patients and 84 healthy control subjects. P300 recordings were obtained in a subsample. A significant difference was not observed between the patients and control subjects in the genotype distributions and allele frequencies. P300 amplitude in schizophrenia patients was significantly lower than that of controls. The P300 latency in schizophrenia patients was also significantly longer than that of controls. The P300 latency of Met homozygotes was significantly shorter than that of Val/Met and of Val/Val carriers at Cz and Pz. The latency of Val/Met carriers was significantly shorter than that of Val/Val carriers at Pz. The results did not suggest an association between the polymorphism in the COMT gene and susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population. However, the COMT Val158Met polymorphism might be a susceptibility variant for P300 abnormality in Chinese Han schizophrenia.

Resting posterior versus frontal delta/theta EEG activity is associated with extraversion and the COMT VAL(158)MET polymorphism.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2010.04.071	Recent studies suggest that resting posterior versus frontal EEG delta/theta activity (delta/theta Pz-Fz) is both sensitive to pharmacological manipulations of neural dopamine and associated with the agency facet of extraversion (i.e., a motivational disposition comprising enthusiasm, energy, assertiveness, achievement striving and social dominance). These observations suggest that posterior versus frontal resting EEG delta/theta activity may represent a useful marker for investigating the molecular genetic basis of extraversion. The present study aimed to test the novel hypothesis of an association between delta/theta Pz-Fz and a functional polymorphism of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT VAL(158)MET) involved in dopamine catabolism. This was conducted in a large EEG data set from the Brain Resource International Database (BRID; resting EEG from N=1093 healthy individuals, 382 of which also genotyped for COMT VAL(158)MET). In summary, we (1) showed for the first time that the VAL allele is associated with increased delta/theta Pz-Fz; (2) replicated the association between extraversion and delta/theta Pz-Fz in a large, heterogeneous sample including both genders; and (3) documented that the VAL allele of the COMT VAL(158)MET is associated with increased extraversion scores, as previously reported for an overlapping BRID sample. This coherent pattern of findings adds further support to the suggestion that the posterior-anterior distribution of resting EEG slow wave activity in the delta/theta range represents a useful tool for probing the dopaminergic basis of extraversion.

Effects of nicotine on the amplitude and gating of the auditory P50 and its influence by dopamine D2 receptor gene polymorphism.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.11.053	Evidence of normalized auditory P50 suppression with acute nicotine in schizophrenia has supported the contention that elevated smoking rates in this disorder may be an attempt to correct a nicotinic receptor pathophysiology that may underly impaired sensory gating in these patients. There is very little information regarding the neurochemical or genetic pathways through which nicotine regulates P50 amplitude and its suppression in human studies. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design with 24 non-smokers, this study examined the influence of TaqIA dopamine D2 receptor gene polymorphisms on P50 and its inhibition during nicotine gum (6 mg) administration. Within a paired click (S(1)-S(2)) paradigm, placebo treated A1(+) and A1(-) allele groups differed with respect to P50 amplitude and gating. While nicotine (relative to placebo) attenuated S(1) P50 amplitude in A1(+) allele carriers, in the A1(-) carriers it increased S(2) P50 amplitude and increased P50 gating as indexed by an augmented gating difference wave (GDW). These findings suggest that nicotine exerts mixed gating properties in healthy nicotine naive volunteers and that dopamine functions to alter both P50 and its gating as well as their response to acute nicotine agonist treatment.

Response inhibition subprocesses and dopaminergic pathways: basal ganglia disease effects.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.09.023	Response inhibition is a component of executive functions, which can be divided into distinct subprocesses by means of event-related potentials (ERPs). These subprocesses are (pre)-motor inhibition and inhibition monitoring, which are probably reflected by the Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3, respectively. Here we ask, if these subprocesses may depend on distinct basal ganglia subsystems. We examined response inhibition processes in an extended sample of young and elderly subjects, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington' disease (HD). This combination of groups also allow us to study whether, and to what degree, pathological basal ganglia changes and healthy aging have similar and/or different effects on these processes. We show that subprocesses of response inhibition are differentially modulated by distinct basal ganglia circuits. Processes related to (pre)-motor inhibition appear to be modulated by the nigrostriatal system, and are sensitive to aging and age-related basal ganglia diseases (i.e. PD). Parkinson's disease induces additive effects of aging and pathology. In contrast, inhibition monitoring is most likely modulated by the mesocortico-limbic dopamine system. These processes are equally affected in healthy aging and both basal ganglia diseases (i.e. PD, HD).

Acute dopamine depletion with branched chain amino acids decreases auditory top-down event-related potentials in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1016/j.schres.2009.03.023	Cerebral dopamine homeostasis has been implicated in a wide range of cognitive processes and is of great pathophysiological importance in schizophrenia. A novel approach to study cognitive effects of dopamine is to deplete its cerebral levels with branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) that acutely lower dopamine precursor amino acid availability. Here, we studied the effects of acute dopamine depletion on early and late attentive cortical processing. Auditory event-related potential (ERP) components N2 and P3 were investigated using high-density electroencephalography in 22 healthy male subjects after receiving BCAAs or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Total free serum prolactin was also determined as a surrogate marker of cerebral dopamine depletion. Acute dopamine depletion increased free plasma prolactin and significantly reduced prefrontal ERP components N2 and P3. Subcomponent analysis of N2 revealed a significant attenuation of early attentive N2b over prefrontal scalp sites. As a proof of concept, these results strongly suggest that BCAAs are acting on basic information processing. Dopaminergic neurotransmission seems to be involved in auditory top-down processing as indexed by prefrontal N2 and P3 reductions during dopamine depletion. In healthy subjects, intact early cortical top-down processing can be acutely dysregulated by ingestion of BCAAs. We discuss the potential impact of these findings on schizophrenia research.

Comparison of visual evoked-related potentials in healthy young adults of different catechol-O-methyltransferase genotypes in a continuous 3-back task.	DOI: 10.1097/wnr.0b013e328317f3b1	We further support the notion that the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphism may play a role in cognitive function. A continuous visual 3-back numerical working memory task was performed for an hour among 21 patients with different COMT genotypes. P300 visual event-related potentials evoked from the 3-back task were first utilized to observe the relationship between this COMT polymorphism and cortical physiology. The results showed that Val/Met heterozygous individuals show poorer performance, lower P300 amplitude, and higher P300 latency than those bearing the Val/Val homozygote on the task. This visual 3-back paradigm is a promising tool to examine continuous working memory capacity. The role of the COMT gene in dopamine catabolism makes for the influence of COMT polymorphism on P300 endophenotypes.

Proline affects brain function in 22q11DS children with the low activity COMT 158 allele.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2008.132	The association between the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) and psychiatric disorders, particularly psychosis, suggests a causal relationship between 22q11DS genes and abnormal brain function. The genes catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) and proline dehydrogenase both reside within the commonly deleted region of 22q11.2. COMT activity and proline levels may therefore be altered in 22q11DS individuals. Associations of both COMT(158) genotype and elevated serum proline levels with abnormal brain function have been reported. Fifty-six 22q11DS children and 75 healthy controls were assessed on physiological measures of brain function, including prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle, P50 auditory sensory gating and smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM). COMT(158) genotype and plasma proline levels were determined in the 22q11DS children. We hypothesized an interaction between the COMT(158) genotype and proline, predicting the strongest negative effect of high proline on brain function to occur in 22q11DS children who are carriers of the COMT(met) allele. Of the three physiological measures, only SPEM and PPI were abnormal in the patient sample. With regard to the SPEM performance, there was a significant interaction between the COMT(158) genotype and proline level with significantly decreased SPEM performance in children with high plasma proline levels and the low activity COMT(met) allele. A similar interaction effect was not observed with regard to PPI. These findings are consistent with a model in which elevated proline negatively affects brain function by an increase in dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. 22q11DS patients with low dopamine catabolic capacity are therefore especially vulnerable to this functional disruption.

Enhanced gamma-band activity in ADHD patients lacks correlation with memory performance found in healthy children.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2008.06.023	Previous electrophysiological as well as imaging research has contributed to the understanding of impairments in attention, executive functions, and memory in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, there is a lack of studies investigating ADHD related differences in the gamma range of human electroencephalogram (EEG), although gamma activity is strongly associated with cognitive processes impaired in ADHD patients and is also modulated by dopamine polymorphisms linked with ADHD. To close this gap, the present study compared gamma activity in ADHD children with that of healthy controls and correlated it with memory performance. EEG was recorded from 13 ADHD patients as well as 13 healthy control subjects during the encoding phase of a visual memory paradigm. In a subsequent recognition test, participants had to judge pictures as being old or new. Analysis of evoked gamma-band responses (GBRs) during stimulus encoding revealed a strong task-related enhancement for ADHD patients in parieto-occipital areas. Interestingly, this augmentation was not associated with recognition performance, whereas healthy subjects exhibited a strong positive correlation between evoked gamma activity during stimulus encoding and subsequent recognition performance. We interpret this finding as evidence of enhanced excitation levels and unspecific activation of processing resources in ADHD patients. Furthermore, enhanced GBRs in ADHD could also indicate a decrease of neuronal signal-to-noise ratio, partially caused by the genetic variations within the dopaminergic pathway of ADHD patients. The involved genetic polymorphisms have been shown to modulate evoked GBRs, which therefore could be a possible marker of impaired neurotransmission in ADHD.

Effects of remote cutaneous pain on trigeminal laser-evoked potentials in migraine patients.

Twelve outpatients suffering from migraine without aura were compared with 10 healthy controls. The LEPs were recorded by 6 scalp electrodes, stimulating the dorsum of the right hand and the right supraorbital zone in basal condition, during the application of 3% capsaicin on the dorsum of the left hand and after capsaicin removal. In normal subjects, the laser pain and the N2-P2 vertex complex obtained by the hand and face stimulation were significantly reduced during remote capsaicin application, with respect to pre-and post-capsaicin conditions, while in migraine LEPs and laser pain were not significantly modified during remote painful stimulation. In migraine a defective brainstem inhibiting control may coexist with cognitive factors of focalised attention to facial pain, less sensitive to distraction by a second pain.

Effects of 50 Hz electromagnetic fields on electroencephalographic alpha activity, dental pain threshold and cardiovascular parameters in humans.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2005.02.072	Recent studies indicate that exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF MFs) influences human electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha activity and pain perception. In the present study we analyse the effect on electrical EEG activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and on nociception in 40 healthy male volunteers after 90-min exposure of the head to 50 Hz ELF MFs at a flux density of 40 or 80 microT in a double-blind randomized sham-controlled study. Since cardiovascular regulation is functionally related to pain modulation, we also measured blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) during treatment. Alpha activity after 80 microT magnetic treatment almost doubled compared to sham treatment. Pain threshold after 40 microT magnetic treatment was significantly lower than after sham treatment. No effects were found for BP and HR. We suggest that these results may be explained by a modulation of sensory gating processes through the opioidergic system, that in turn is influenced by magnetic exposure.

Analgesic effects of low-dose intravenous orphenadrine in the state of capsaicin hyperalgesia. A randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study using laser somatosensory evoked potentials obtained from capsaicin-irritated skin in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1055/s-0031-1297020	The present investigation aimed to elucidate the analgesic efficacy of 30 mg of intravenous orphenadrine citrate (CAS 4682-36-4) in a human pain model. Eighteen healthy female and male subjects were enrolled and received single infusions of 30 mg orphenadrine citrate and matching placebo in two periods which were separated by a 1 week washout period. The study was designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, cross-over trial. The intended neurogenic inflammation and hyperalgesia were induced by topical, occlusive application of 1% capsaicin solution (INCI: Capsicum frutescens, containing capsaicinoides from Capsicum annuum annuum, CAS 84603-55-4) for 30 min on defined skin areas of the back. The pain response to CO2 laser pulses applied to the capsaicin pre-treated skin was measured by event related Vertex-EEG recordings. This technique allowed studying the influence of orphenadrine citrate on the (central) P2-component and the (peripheral) Ni-component of the pain response (LSEP). Both, orphenadrine citrate and placebo were given as intravenous infusions over 60 min. Orphenadrine citrate exerted a significant reduction in central and peripheral components of the pain response when compared to placebo. The effect on the central component was highly significant and more pronounced than the peripheral effect of the drug. The analgesic effect developed fast, was already present during infusion, was ongoing, and exceeded the observational period of 4 h after start of infusion. In summary, orphenadrine citrate was able to exert an analgesic/anti-hyperalgesic effect in a low-dose paradigm (30 mg dose) which was predominantly due to central/spinal mechanisms in this capsaicin model with laser somatosensory evoked potentials.

Inhibitory effect of capsaicin evoked trigeminal pain on warmth sensation and warmth evoked potentials.	DOI: 10.1007/s00221-004-1983-1	The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of tonic pain evoked by topical application of capsaicin on the somatosensory sensation of warmth. The warmth pathways were studied in ten healthy subjects by recording the scalp potentials evoked by non-painful warm laser stimuli delivered on both the right and left perioral region (warmth C-fiber related laser-evoked potentials (C-LEPs)). Tonic pain was induced by topical capsaicin application above the lateral part of the right upper lip. The area of primary and secondary hyperalgesia were mapped. C-LEPs were obtained from 31 scalp electrodes before, during, and after capsaicin application. C-LEPs from the right perioral region were evoked by laser stimuli delivered to the area of secondary hyperalgesia during capsaicin application and on both the areas of primary and secondary hyperalgesia after capsaicin removal. While the lateralized N1/P1 component (around 185 ms of latency) was not affected by the capsaicin, the amplitudes of the later vertex C-LEPs (around 260 and 410 ms of latency for the N2a and P2 potentials, respectively) evoked from the secondary hyperalgesic area on the right side and from a symmetrical non-hyperalgesic area on the left perioral region were significantly decreased during capsaicin application and after capsaicin removal, as compared with the baseline recordings. At the same times, the rating of the laser-evoked warmth sensation was reduced significantly. This inhibitory effect can occur at brainstem level and is possibly due to: 1) trigemino-cortico-trigeminal circuits, similar to those mediating the classical diffuse noxious inhibitory control, or 2) an increased background activity of the capsaicin-insensitive A-fibers, which mediate the secondary hyperalgesia. Probably due to a peripheral inhibitory mechanism, neither reliable C-LEP components nor warmth sensation were evoked by laser pulses delivered to the primary hyperalgesic area. This is the first neurophysiological evidence in humans of an inhibitory effect of pain on warmth sensation.

Subthalamic nucleus stimulation modulates motor cortex oscillatory activity in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awh053	In Parkinson's disease, impaired motor preparation has been related to an increased latency in the appearance of movement-related desynchronization (MRD) throughout the contralateral primary sensorimotor (PSM) cortex. Internal globus pallidus (GPi) stimulation improved movement desynchronization over the PSM cortex during movement execution but failed to improve impaired motor preparation. PET studies indicate that subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation partly reverses the abnormal premotor pattern of brain activation during movement. By monitoring MRD, we aimed to assess changes in premotor and PSM cortex oscillatory activity induced by bilateral STN stimulation and to compare these changes with those induced by l-dopa. Ten Parkinson's disease patients and a group of healthy, age-matched controls performed self-paced wrist flexions in each of four conditions: without either stimulation or l-dopa (the 'off' condition), with stimulation and without l-dopa (On Stim), with l-dopa and without stimulation ('on drug'), and with both stimulation and l-dopa (On Both). Compared with the Off condition, in both the On Stim and the On Drug condition the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III score decreased by about 60% and in the On Both condition it decreased by 80%. The desynchronization latency over central regions contralateral to movement and the movement desynchronization over bilateral central regions were significantly increased by stimulation and by l-dopa, with a maximal effect when the two were associated. Furthermore, desynchronization latency significantly decreased over bilateral frontocentral regions in the three treatment conditions compared with the Off condition. In Parkinson's disease, STN stimulation may induce a change in abnormal cortical oscillatory activity patterns (similar to that produced by l-dopa) by decreasing the abnormal spreading of desynchronization over frontocentral regions and increasing PSM cortex activity during movement preparation and execution, with a correlated improvement in bradykinesia. Parkinsonians under treatment displayed a desynchronization pattern close to that seen in healthy, age-matched controls, although central latencies remained shorter. The study indicates that it is possible to influence cortical reactivity related to the planning and execution of voluntary movement through the basal ganglia, and furthermore that the oscillatory activity of the PSM cortex (in addition to that of premotor areas) could be of major importance in the control of movement-associated, neural activity in Parkinson's disease.

Selective alterations of the first NREM sleep cycle in humans by a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist (NNC-687).	DOI: 10.1016/s0022-3956(03)00007-4	This paper details the first study of the effects of dopamine D1 receptor antagonism on the regulation of human sleep EEG (electroencephalogram). The investigational drug NNC-687 (NNC 01-0687/CEE 03-310) was administered to 20 healthy young men in doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg in a double blinded, placebo controlled, crossover design. In rats, dopamine D1 receptor antagonism can produce large increases in the amounts of both rapid eye-movement (REM) and non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep. In this study, drug effects were most prominent in the first NREM period. D1 antagonism markedly reduced the peak-amplitude of delta EEG waves but increased their instantaneous frequency as well as enhancing the total number, incidence, and burst-duration of sleep spindles. The length of the first NREM period was increased up to 47% over baseline. Despite these large increases in NREM sleep time, the amount of delta EEG power accumulated over the first NREM period was conserved at baseline levels. We note that the sleep-EEG profile of D1 antagonism is very similar to that of GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor modulators and suggest that D1 antagonism may alter the properties of the neuronal networks which generate delta and spindle, and K-complex EEG waveforms through the upstream modulation of GABAA receptor activity.

Defective cortical drive to muscle in Parkinson's disease and its improvement with levodopa.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awf042	We recorded whole-scalp magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals simultaneously with surface electromyographic (EMG) activity from eight patients with Parkinson's disease after withdrawal and reinstatement of treatment with levodopa. Variations were seen in the coherence between the forearm extensor EMG and the MEG signal originating near or in the hand region of the primary motor cortex. As a group, the parkinsonian patients withdrawn from levodopa showed a reduction in the coherence at 15-30 Hz and 35-60 Hz, and a further three untreated patients had abnormally strong MEG-EMG coherence at 5-12 Hz compared with when medicated or with eight healthy age-matched control subjects. We conclude that the basal ganglia have a specific effect on the temporal organization of motor cortical activity during voluntary tonic contraction. Abnormalities in this aspect of basal ganglia function may directly contribute to bradykinesia and weakness in Parkinson's disease.

Topographic effects of tonic cutaneous nociceptive stimulation on human electroencephalograph.	DOI: 10.1016/s0304-3940(01)01802-x	To examine the specific effects of cutaneous pain on electroencephalographic (EEG) activities, tonic painful and non-painful sensations in left forearm were induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin 100 microg/20microl and the same volume of vehicle, respectively, in 15 healthy males. The EEG data acquired in five experimental conditions: (i) baseline A; (ii) non-painful vehicle injection; (iii) baseline B; (iv) painful capsaicin injection and (v) waning pain, were analyzed and compared with analysis of variance. Only the painful capsaicin injection evoked significant decreases of theta, alpha-1 and alpha-2 powers over the centro-parieto-occipital regions compared with baseline B. No significant difference in EEG activation between the non-painful vehicle injection and painful capsaicin injection was found. This implicates that the observed topographic EEG activation is not specific for pain but probably related to the cutaneous stimulation.

Dopaminergic influences on the P300 abnormality in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1016/s0022-510x(98)00102-6	This study was designed to evaluate the contribution of central dopaminergic mechanisms to the P300 event-related potential (P300) abnormality in Parkinson's disease. We measured the P300 in 37 non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (19 de novo and 18 levodopa-treated) and 15 age-matched healthy volunteers. The P300 measurement was repeated in 14 de novo patients, after 6-12 months levodopa therapy. The severity of parkinsonian symptom was assessed using the UPDRS-motor scale. De novo patients showed prolonged P300 latency compared with levodopa-treated patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The levodopa therapy for 6-12 months significantly shortened the P300 latency and reduced the UPDRS-motor examination score in de novo patients. However, the percent changes in the P300 latency were not correlated with those in the UPDRS-motor examination score. These results indicate that the central dopaminergic mechanisms apart from those responsible for motor symptoms, may contribute to the P300 abnormality in Parkinson's disease.

Central effects of repeated administration of atenolol and captopril in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00195911	The central effects of atenolol (50 mg tds) and captopril (50 mg tds) ingested for a period of seven days were studied in ten healthy volunteers. A placebo and two active control drugs, methyldopa (250 mg tds) and oxazepam (10 mg), were included in the design. Oxazepam was ingested on the seventh day only, with a placebo being taken on the preceding six days. On the seventh day, central effects of the drugs were tested at 10.00-11.00 h (session 1), immediately before the subjects' last dose of each drug and at 2.5-3.5 h after the final dose of each drug (1330-1430 h, session 2). Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. Subjects assessed their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analogue scales. Recordings of the EEG and body sway were carried out. Neither atenolol nor captopril altered performance at any of the skills tested. There were no effects on subjectively assessed alertness or mood with captopril, while atenolol significantly increased wakefulness in session 2 and when the two sessions were meaned.

Dopaminergic pharmacological manipulations in normal humans confirm the specificity of the visual (PERG-VEP) and cognitive (P300) electrophysiological alterations in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1016/b978-0-444-81352-7.50026-1	Retinal and occipital visual evoked potentials and event-related potentials (P300) have been recorded in normal human subjects before and after the administration of the dopaminergic receptor antagonist, haloperidol, and/or the dopaminergic precursor L-DOPA. The data show that either retinal or occipital visual potentials and P300 are delayed by haloperidol. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that haloperidol in healthy subjects mimicks the electrophysiological abnormalities observed in Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, L-DOPA does not generally modify these latencies in normals, while it is known to decrease the same parameters in parkinsonian patients. This is in accord with the involvement of a specific mechanism in the recovery observed in parkinsonian patients after L-DOPA therapy. Our data confirm that the alterations of visual and cognitive potentials observed in Parkinson's disease are closely related to the impairment of dopaminergic transmission.

Effects of indeloxazine hydrochloride on sleep in normal humans.		The effects of 40 mg of indeloxazine hydrochloride, a cerebral metabolic enhancer, on sleep were investigated in 6 healthy male students. Polygraphic recordings were made for 8 consecutive nights on each subject. An inert placebo was given on the first 3 nights and on the 7th and 8th nights, and 40 mg of indeloxazine was administered on the 4th, 5th and 6th nights. Drug and placebo were administered orally at 21:30 h, and the recording of polysomnograms started at 22:00 h and ended at 8:00 h the next morning. The polysomnograms were evaluated by computerized automatic analysis using the interval histogram method. Indeloxazine prolonged both sleep latency and REM latency, and increased stage 1 sleep, but decreased stages 3, 4 and REM sleep. A significant increase of REM sleep was observed on the 7th and 8th recovery nights. No obvious changes were shown in the subjective assessments after administration of the drug. These results suggest that the effects of indeloxazine on sleep are similar to those of the tricyclic antidepressants. Furthermore, polysomnographic examinations might be useful in evaluating the pharmacological properties of cerebral metabolic enhancers.

Relationship between advanced glycated end products and maternal cognition in gestational diabetes: a case control study.	DOI: 10.1080/14767058.2021.1937111	Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a form of glucose intolerance which manifests during pregnancy. There is lack of literature regarding the study of cognitive functions in GDM. Recent evidences suggests an increase in accumulation of serum Advanced glycated end products (AGE'S) during GDM. Accumulation of AGE's in brain can induce changes in permeability of blood brain barrier and creates oxidative stress and inflammation that can alter cognitive functions. In this study we hypothesize that diagnosis of GDM in pregnancy is related to lower cognitive scores which is correlated to increased serum AGE's level.

Errors elicit frontoparietal theta-gamma coupling that is modulated by endogenous estradiol levels.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2024.112299	Cognitive control-related error monitoring is intimately involved in behavioral adaptation, learning, and individual differences in a variety of psychological traits and disorders. Accumulating evidence suggests that a focus on women's health and ovarian hormones is critical to the study of such cognitive brain functions. Here we sought to identify a novel index of error monitoring using a time-frequency based phase amplitude coupling (t-f PAC) measure and examine its modulation by endogenous levels of estradiol in females. Forty-three healthy, naturally cycling young adult females completed a flanker task while continuous electroencephalogram was recorded on four occasions across the menstrual cycle. Results revealed significant error-related t-f PAC between theta phase generated in fronto-central areas and gamma amplitude generated in parietal-occipital areas. Moreover, this error-related theta-gamma coupling was enhanced by endogenous levels of estradiol both within females across the cycle as well as between females with higher levels of average circulating estradiol. While the role of frontal midline theta in error processing is well documented, this paper extends the extant literature by illustrating that error monitoring involves the coordination between multiple distributed systems with the slow midline theta activity modulating the power of gamma-band oscillatory activity in parietal regions. They further show enhancement of inter-regional coupling by endogenous estradiol levels, consistent with research indicating modulation of cognitive control neural functions by the endocrine system in females. Together, this work identifies a novel neurophysiological marker of cognitive control-related error monitoring in females that has implications for neuroscience and women's health.

Hormonal status effects on the electrophysiological correlates of performance monitoring in women.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2022.106006	Fluctuations in ovarian hormones are thought to play a role in the increased prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders in women. Error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) are two putative electrophysiological biomarkers for these internalizing disorders. We investigated whether female hormonal status, specifically menstrual cycle phase and oral contraceptive (OC) use, impact ERN and Pe. Additionally, we examined whether the relationship between the ERN and negative affect (NA) was moderated by hormonal status and tested whether the ERN mediated the relation between ovarian hormones and NA. Participants were healthy, pre-menopausal women who were naturally cycling (NC) or using OCs. Using a counterbalanced within-subject design, all participants performed a speeded-choice reaction-time task twice while undergoing electroencephalography measurements. NC women (N = 42) performed this task during the early follicular and midluteal phase (when estrogen and progesterone are both low and both high, respectively), while OC users (N = 42) performed the task during active OC use and during their pill-free week. Estradiol and progesterone levels were assessed in saliva. Comparing the two cycle phases within NC women revealed no differences in the (Δ)ERN, (Δ)Pe or NA. We did observe a negative relation between phase-related changes in the ΔERN and changes in NA. Mediation analysis additionally showed that phase-related changes in estradiol were indirectly and negatively related to NA through a reduction of ΔERN amplitudes. When comparing active OC users with NC women, we observed increased ΔPe- but not (Δ)ERN amplitudes in the former group. No evidence was found for moderating effects of menstrual cycle phase or OC use on the relation between the ERN and NA. These findings suggest that hormonal status may impact the neural correlates of performance monitoring and error sensitivity, and that this could be a potential mechanism through which ovarian hormones influence mood.

Implicit motor imagery performance and cortical activity throughout the menstrual cycle.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-022-25766-2	Studies show that female motor and visuospatial skills are modulated by the menstrual cycle. Implicit motor imagery, meaning the involuntary imagination of movements during a task, involves kinesthetic, visual, and spatial aspects of the corresponding action and can be investigated by using the hand laterality judgment task (HLJT). In this study we aimed to investigate whether implicit motor imagery performance and cortical activity are altered throughout the menstrual cycle, as demonstrated by motor skills in females. Thus, 31 healthy women underwent HLJT during the menstrual, follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles. Right-handed participants had to recognize the laterality (right or left) of hands presented in different views (palm or back) and orientations on a computer screen. Test performance and EEG event-related potentials were analyzed. Participants performed better in the test in the follicular and luteal phases when compared to the menstrual phase, and the accuracy of the test was positively correlated with estradiol levels in the follicular phase. The difference between medial and lateral hand orientations for rotation-related negativity was significant in the medial and left parieto-occipital regions only in the follicular phase. These findings suggest positive modulating action of estradiol in performing implicit motor imagery.

Ovarian Cycle Stages Modulate Alzheimer-Related Cognitive and Brain Network Alterations in Female Mice.	DOI: 10.1523/ENEURO.0132-17.2018	Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins several decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, at a time when women may still undergo reproductive cycling. Whether ovarian functions alter substrates of AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that ovarian cycle stages significantly modulate AD-related alterations in neural network patterns, cognitive impairments, and pathogenic protein production in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of AD. Female hAPP mice spent more time in estrogen-dominant cycle stages and these ovarian stages worsened AD-related network dysfunction and cognitive impairments. In contrast, progesterone-dominant stages and gonadectomy attenuated these AD-related deficits. Further studies revealed a direct role for estradiol in stimulating neural network excitability and susceptibility to seizures in hAPP mice and increasing amyloid beta levels. Understanding dynamic effects of the ovarian cycle on the female nervous system in disease, including AD, is of critical importance and may differ from effects on a healthy brain. The pattern of ovarian cycle effects on disease-related networks, cognition, and pathogenic protein expression may be relevant to young women at risk for AD.

Neural plasticity is modified over the human menstrual cycle: Combined insight from sensory evoked potential LTP and repetition suppression.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nlm.2018.08.016	In healthy women, fluctuations in hormones including progesterone and oestradiol lead to functional changes in the brain over the course of each menstrual cycle. Though considerable attention has been directed towards understanding changes in human cognition over the menstrual cycle, changes in underlying processes such as neural plasticity have largely only been studied in animals. In this study we explored predictive coding and repetition suppression via the roving mismatch negativity paradigm as a model of short-term plasticity (Garrido, Kilner, Kiebel, et al., 2009), and Hebbian learning via visual sensory long-term potentiation (LTP) as a model of long-term plasticity (Teyler et al., 2005). Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in 20 females during their early follicular and mid-luteal phases. Event-related potential (ERP) analyses were complemented with dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to characterise changes in the underlying neural architecture. More sustained variability in the ERP response to a change in tone during the luteal phase are interpreted as a delayed habituation of the P3a component in the luteal relative to the follicular phase. The additional increased forward connection strength over tone repetitions compared to the follicular phase suggests that, in this phase, females may be less efficient when processing deviations from predicted sensory input (error). In contrast, there appears to be no reliable change in sensory LTP. This suggests that predictive coding, but not Hebbian plasticity is modified in the mid-luteal compared to the follicular phase, at least at the days of the menstrual cycle tested. This finding implicates the human menstrual cycle in complex changes in neural plasticity and provides further evidence for the importance of considering the menstrual cycle when including females in electrophysiological research.

Variations in resting frontal alpha asymmetry between high- and low-neuroticism females across the menstrual cycle.	DOI: 10.1111/psyp.12301	Resting frontal alpha asymmetry measures the relative activation intensity across the left and right frontal regions that represent emotional experience. Here, the focus is on levels of alpha asymmetry between high- and low-neuroticism females across the menstrual cycle. Resting alpha asymmetry in healthy females who scored high or low on neuroticism was assessed during the menstrual phase, the late follicular phase, and the midlate luteal phase. High-neuroticism females exhibited lower relative left prefrontal activity than did low-neuroticism females during the midlate luteal phase, as indexed by alpha1 and alphaTotal asymmetry scores at the prefrontal electrode positions (FP1/2 ). EEG results demonstrate that the resting frontal alpha asymmetry of high- and low-neuroticism females was moderated by the menstrual cycle, and high-neuroticism females should pay particular attention to their emotional experience during the midlate luteal phase.

40 Hz auditory steady-state response in females: When is it better to entrain?	DOI: 10.55782/ane-2014-1975	Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are widely applied to test brain's ability to follow external stimulation in neuropsychiatric disorders. It is known that ASSRs are related to GABAergic transmission. Female sex steroid homones - both estrogens and progesterone - affect functioning of GABAergic system. However, it is not known how these hormones affect brain's ability to entrain. This study was designed to test the ability to synchronize to 40 Hz stimulation during different phases of the menstrual cycle. Twenty-eight healthy females participated in the research during one of the menstrual cycle phases: (1) early follicular; (2) late follicular; (3) and mid-luteal. Auditory 40 Hz trains of 500 ms were delivered binaurally and EEG was recorded. Time-frequency analysis of the data was performed and phase-locking index, evoked amplitude and total intensity measures were extracted and decomposed by non-negative multi-way factorization. Additionally, alpha power of the baseline period was calculated. Parameters of ASSR were increasing in a linear manner with increasing levels of 17β-estradiol and largest estimates of ASSR parameters were obtained in the late follicular phase, smallest - in the mid-luteal phase. Alpha power values were highest in the late follicular phase and lowest in the mid-luteal phase, pointing to lower arousal level in the late follicular phase. We speculate that increased 40 Hz ASSRs during mid-cycle might be related to the level of general arousal and specific GABA-mediated changes during the menstrual cycle. The results suggest that the ability to entrain to 40 Hz stimulation depends on the phase of menstrual cycle. This should be taken into account, particularly when ASSRs are used in clinical practice, comparing patients and healthy subjects.

Sleep and the sleep electroencephalogram across the menstrual cycle in young healthy women.	DOI: 10.1210/jcem.81.2.8636295	Cyclic changes in hormones, body temperature, and metabolic rate characterize the menstrual cycle. To investigate whether these changes are associated with changes in sleep and the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG), a total of 138 sleep episodes from 9 women with no premenstrual syndrome symptoms were recorded every second night throughout one ovulatory menstrual cycle and analyzed in relation to menstrual phase. Ovulation and menstrual cycle stage were confirmed by measurements of temperature, urinary LH, and midluteal plasma levels of estrogen and progesterone. No significant variation across the menstrual cycle was observed for subjective ratings of sleep quality and mood as well as for objective measures of total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, rapid eye movement sleep latency, and slow wave sleep. In nonrapid eye movement sleep, EEG power density in the 14.25-15.0 hertz band, which corresponds to the upper frequency range of the sleep spindles, exhibited a large variation across the menstrual cycle, with a maximum in the luteal phase. The data show that in healthy young women, sleep spindle frequency activity varies in parallel with core body temperature, whereas homeostatic sleep regulatory mechanisms, as indexed by the time course of EEG slow wave activity are not substantially affected by the menstrual cycle.

The event-related hemodynamic response obtained from fMRI showed delayed BOLD peak latency in the contralateral primary motor area suggesting a less efficient activity of the neuronal populations driving fine movements, which are specifically impaired in ULD.

DOI: 10.1007/s40263-020-00738-0	The delta opioid receptor (DOR) has been identified as a therapeutic target for migraine, with DOR agonists exhibiting low abuse potential compared with conventional µ-opioid agonists. TRV250 is a novel small molecule agonist of the DOR that is preferentially selective for G-protein signaling, with relatively little activation of the β-arrestin2 post-receptor signaling pathway. This selectivity provides reduced susceptibility to proconvulsant activity seen with non-selective DOR agonists. TRV250 significantly reduced nitroglycerin-evoked hyperalgesia in rodents, indicating a potential utility in acute migraine without the risk of seizure activity or abuse potential.

Nitroglycerin sensitises in healthy subjects CNS structures involved in migraine pathophysiology: evidence from a study of nociceptive blink reflexes and visual evoked potentials.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pain.2009.04.018	Nitroglycerin (NTG), a NO donor, induces an attack in migraine patients approximately 4-6 h after administration. The causative mechanisms are not known, but the long delay leaves room for a central effect, such as a change in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission of various CNS areas involved in pain and behaviour including trigeminal nucleus caudalis and monoaminergic brain stem nuclei. To explore the central action of NTG, we have studied its effects on amplitude and habituation of the nociceptive blink reflex (nBR) and the visual evoked potential (VEP) before, 1 h and 4 h after administration of NTG (1.2 mg sublingual) or placebo (vehicle sublingual) in two groups of 10 healthy volunteers. We found a significant decrease in nBR pain and reflex thresholds both 1 and 4 h post-NTG. At the 4 h time point R2 latency was shorter (p=0.04) and R2 response area increased (p<0.01) after NTG but not after placebo. Habituation tended to become more pronounced after both NTG and placebo administration. There was a significant amplitude increase in the 5th VEP block (p=0.03) at 1h after NTG and in the 1st block (p=0.04) at 4 h. VEP habituation was replaced by potentiation at both delays after NTG; the change in habituation slope was significant at 1h (p=0.02). There were no significant VEP changes in subjects who received sublingual placebo. In conclusion, we found that in healthy subjects sublingual NTG, but not its vehicle, induces changes in a trigeminal nociceptive reflex and an evoked cortical response which are comparable to those found immediately before and during an attack of migraine. These changes could be relevant for the attack-triggering effect of NTG in migraineurs.

Temporal codes of visual working memory in the human cerebral cortex: Brain rhythms associated with high memory capacity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117294	Visual working memory (vWM) is an important ability required for various cognitive tasks although its neural underpinnings remain unclear. While many studies have focused on theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma (> 30 Hz) rhythms as a substrate of vWM, here we show that temporal signals embedded in alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands can be a good predictor of vWM capacity. Neural activity of healthy human participants was recorded with magnetoencephalography when they performed a classical vWM task (change detection). We analyzed changes in inter-peak intervals (IPIs) of oscillatory signals along with an increase in WM load (a number of to-be-memorized items, 1-6). Results showed a load-dependent reduction of IPIs in the parietal and frontal regions, indicating that alpha/beta rhythms became faster when multiple items were stored in vWM. Furthermore, this reduction in IPIs was positively correlated with individual vWM capacity, especially in the frontal cortex. Those results indicate that vWM is represented as a change in oscillation frequency in the human cerebral cortex.

Characterization of the CNS effects of naftidrofuryl (Praxilène) by quantitative EEG and functional MRI: a study in healthy elderly subjects.	DOI: 10.1159/000073634	In the present study, we investigated the effects of a single and a repeated (5 days) administration of naftidrofuryl, a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor inhibitor having neuroprotective properties, on functional brain physiology in male healthy elderly subjects, using quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twelve subjects aged 60 +/- 3.8 years completed the quantitative EEG study, where the effects of 400 and 600 mg were assessed, and 12 other subjects (aged 56 +/- 4.7 years) completed the fMRI study, where the effect of 400 mg was assessed on the brain activation induced by the continuous performance test (CPT). Naftidrofuryl induced a transient reduction in alpha activity followed by a specific synchronisation of the 9.5- to 11-Hz EEG activity most pronounced after repeated administration. Such regimen also increased the CPT-induced brain activation visualized by way of fMRI. The results of the present study can be interpreted at the functional level that naftidrofuryl induced an improved level of vigilance or an increased capacity of alertness in healthy elderly subjects.

Cardiac and CNS toxicity of levobupivacaine: strengths of evidence for advantage over bupivacaine.	DOI: 10.2165/00002018-200225030-00002	Bupivacaine is currently the most widely used long-acting local anaesthetic. Its uses include surgery and obstetrics; however, it has been associated with potentially fatal cardiotoxicity, particularly when given intravascularly by accident. Levobupivacaine, a single enantiomer of bupivacaine, has recently been introduced as a new long-acting local anaesthetic with a potentially reduced toxicity compared with bupivacaine. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have compared levobupivacaine with bupivacaine and in most but not all studies there is evidence that levobupivacaine is less toxic. Advantages for levobupivacaine are seen on cardiac sodium and potassium channels, on isolated animal hearts and in whole animals, anaesthetised or awake. In particular the intravascular dose of levobupivacaine required to cause lethality in animals is consistently higher compared with bupivacaine. In awake sheep, for example, almost 78% more levobupivacaine was required to cause death. In contrast, in anaesthetised dogs no differences were seen in the incidence of spontaneous or electrical stimulation- induced ventricular tachycardia and fibrillations among animals exposed to levobupivacaine or bupivacaine. The reversibility of levobupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity has also been assessed. Some data point to an advantage of levobupivacaine over bupivacaine but this potential advantage was not confirmed in a recent study in anaesthetised dogs. Three clinical studies have been conducted using surrogate markers of both cardiac and CNS toxicity. In these studies levobupivacaine or bupivacaine were given by intravascular injection to healthy volunteers. Levobupivacaine was found to cause smaller changes in indices of cardiac contractility and the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and also to have less depressant effect on the electroencephalogram. Assuming that levobupivacaine has the same local anaesthetic potency as bupivacaine, then, all things being equal, it is difficult to argue that levobupivacaine should not displace bupivacaine as the long-acting local anaesthetic of choice. It would appear, however, that levobupivacaine has not yet significantly displaced bupivacaine from the markets in which it is sold. This may be due to a lack of perceived safety benefit and/or consideration of the additional costs that are associated with switching to levobupivacaine, which is approximately 57% more expensive than bupivacaine. If the price of levobupivacaine were closer to bupivacaine then the argument to switch to levobupivacaine would undoubtedly be much stronger. With the continued clinical use of levobupivacaine the database available to make comparisons will increase and this may allow cost-benefit arguments to be made more forcefully for levobupivacaine in the future.

Psychotropic profile of S 17092, a prolyl endopeptidase inhibitor, using quantitative EEG in young healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1159/000107070	The central activity of S 17092, a prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) inhibitor, was investigated by quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) in 48 young healthy men participating in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. S 17092 (100, 200, 400 or 600 mg) and placebo were administered once daily for 10 days in a rising multiple-dose scheme. EEG recordings were performed before and repeatedly from 0.5 to 24 h after dose on day 1 and day 10. PEP activity in plasma was also measured for the same periods. S 17092 appeared as a potent inhibitor of PEP activity at all doses, after both single and repeated administrations. EEG changes after acute doses were slight and of short duration, mainly characterized by increased relative alpha 1 power, suggesting a vigilance-promoting EEG profile. After repeated doses and more strikingly after a superimposed dose, increases in relative alpha 1 power were still present with additional increase in relative delta power and decreases in absolute fast alpha, fast beta, theta powers and total power at all doses. These EEG findings suggest that S 17092 might possess some mood-stabilizing potential in addition to its cognition-enhancing properties.

Predictive value of pharmaco-electroencephalography in early human-pharmacological evaluations of psychoactive drugs. First example: savoxepine.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2007-1014469	The present paper forms the first part of a contribution to a comprehensive critical evaluation of the use of pharmaco-electroencephalography (pharmaco-EEG) as an instrument in the evaluation of pharmacodynamic effects of psychoactive drugs in man and further prediction of therapeutic effects by utilizing partial effects in a clinical pharmacological model situation. The basic principles and the methodological approaches are described first, prior to discussing the possibilities and limitations of the pharmaco-EEG in postulating hypotheses about therapeutic efficacy of psychoactive drugs in man. The discussion rests upon the findings with three selected new psychoactive drugs (savoxepine, levoprotiline and maroxepine), presented in this (Part I) and subsequent (Part II and III) reports. In this report results obtained with savoxepine, a novel tetracyclic compound, are described. Convergent evidence for antipsychotic potential of this drug has emerged from preclinical and pharmaco-EEG studies, subsequently corroborated by the first open trials in patients suffering from acute episodes of schizophrenia. In the pharmaco-EEG study a single dose of 0.5 mg savoxepine was tested in 15 healthy subjects with comparison to chlorpromazine (75 mg) and placebo. The experimental design was a threefold cross-over uncompleted block design with three consecutive trial days one week apart. Pharmaco-EEG was recorded under a high situational level of vigilance before 3 h and 6 h after drug administration. The recording was performed by means of 12 electrodes placed in the frontal, central, parietal and occipital regions. EEG-maps were constructed after power spectral analysis of absolute power changes in predetermined frequency bands within the range 0.5 to 30.0 Hz. The findings indicated EEG effects of savoxepine similar to those of chlorpromazine. In the tested dosage, however, savoxepine showed higher potency, later maximum (6 h) of the effect and lower sedative potential. Clinical trials performed in two centres and in, altogether, 28 acutely psychotic patients indicated antipsychotic activity of the drug in a low range of doses (on average, 0.1 to 0.9 mg/d). Even though the antipsychotic efficacy of savoxepine remains to be confirmed in controlled studies, the results favour the hypothesis that pharmaco-EEG has a value in predicting the quality of action of a new drug in man. Results also favour the complementary use of pharmaco-EEG in human pharmacology testing in order to objectively assess central effects of drugs and rationally estimate the doses for therapeutic trials.

Disrupted brain functional connectivity as early signature in cognitively healthy individuals with pathological CSF amyloid/tau.	DOI: 10.1038/s42003-024-06673-w	Alterations in functional connectivity (FC) have been observed in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with elevated amyloid (Aβ) and tau. However, it is not yet known whether directed FC is already influenced by Aβ and tau load in cognitively healthy (CH) individuals. A 21-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was used from 46 CHs classified based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ tau ratio: pathological (CH-PAT) or normal (CH-NAT). Directed FC was estimated with Partial Directed Coherence in frontal, temporal, parietal, central, and occipital regions. We also examined the correlations between directed FC and various functional metrics, including neuropsychology, cognitive reserve, MRI volumetrics, and heart rate variability between both groups. Compared to CH-NATs, the CH-PATs showed decreased FC from the temporal regions, indicating a loss of relative functional importance of the temporal regions. In addition, frontal regions showed enhanced FC in the CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs, suggesting neural compensation for the damage caused by the pathology. Moreover, CH-PATs showed greater FC in the frontal and occipital regions than CH-NATs. Our findings provide a useful and non-invasive method for EEG-based analysis to identify alterations in brain connectivity in CHs with a pathological versus normal CSF Aβ/tau.

Practice makes imperfect: stronger implicit interference with practice in individuals at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.	DOI: 10.1007/s11357-023-00953-9	Early screening to determine patient risk of developing Alzheimer's will allow better interventions and planning but necessitates accessible methods such as behavioral biomarkers. Previously, we showed that cognitively healthy older individuals whose cerebrospinal fluid amyloid/tau ratio indicates high risk of cognitive decline experienced implicit interference during a high-effort task, signaling early changes in attention. To further investigate attention's effect on implicit interference, we analyzed two experiments completed sequentially by the same high- and low-risk individuals. We hypothesized that if attention modulates interference, practice would affect the influence of implicit distractors. Indeed, while both groups experienced a strong practice effect, the association between practice and interference effects diverged between groups: stronger practice effects correlated with more implicit interference in high-risk participants, but less interference in low-risk individuals. Furthermore, low-risk individuals showed a positive correlation between implicit interference and EEG low-range alpha event-related desynchronization when switching from high- to low-load tasks. This suggests that lower attention on the task was correlated with stronger interference, a typical phenomenon in the younger population. These results demonstrate how attention impacts implicit interference and highlight early differences in perception between high- and low-risk individuals.

Alpha desynchronization during Stroop test unmasks cognitively healthy individuals with abnormal CSF Amyloid/Tau.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2021.11.009	Synaptic dysfunctions precede cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease by decades, affect executive functions, and can be detected by quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). We used quantitative electroencephalography combined with Stroop testing to identify changes of inhibitory controls in cognitively healthy individuals with an abnormal versus normal ratio of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid/total-tau. We studied two groups of participants (60-94 years) with either normal (CH-NAT or controls, n = 20) or abnormal (CH-PAT, n = 21) CSF amyloid/tau ratio. We compared: alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD), alpha spectral entropy (SE), and their relationships with estimated cognitive reserve. CH-PATs had more negative occipital alpha ERD, and higher frontal and occipital alpha SE during low load congruent trials, indicating hyperactivity. CH-PATs demonstrated fewer frontal SE changes with higher load, incongruent Stroop testing. Correlations of alpha ERD with estimated cognitive reserve were significant in CH-PATs but not in CH-NATs. These results suggested compensatory hyperactivity in CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs. We did not find differences in alpha ERD comparisons with individual CSF amyloid(A), p-tau(T), total-tau(N) biomarkers.

Early brainstem [18F]THK5351 uptake is linked to cortical hyperexcitability in healthy aging.	DOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.142514	BACKGROUNDNeuronal hyperexcitability characterizes the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In animals, early misfolded tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) protein accumulation - both central to AD neuropathology - promote cortical excitability and neuronal network dysfunction. In healthy humans, misfolded tau and Aβ aggregates are first detected, respectively, in the brainstem and frontomedial and temporobasal cortices, decades prior to the onset of AD cognitive symptoms. Whether cortical excitability is related to early brainstem tau - and its associated neuroinflammation - and cortical Aβ aggregations remains unknown.METHODSWe probed frontal cortex excitability, using transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography, in a sample of 64 healthy late-middle-aged individuals (50-69 years; 45 women and 19 men). We assessed whole-brain [18F]THK5351 PET uptake as a proxy measure of tau/neuroinflammation, and we assessed whole-brain Aβ burden with [18F]Flutemetamol or [18F]Florbetapir radiotracers.RESULTSWe found that higher [18F]THK5351 uptake in a brainstem monoaminergic compartment was associated with increased cortical excitability (r = 0.29, P = 0.02). By contrast, [18F]THK5351 PET signal in the hippocampal formation, although strongly correlated with brainstem signal in whole-brain voxel-based quantification analyses (P value corrected for family-wise error [PFWE-corrected] < 0.001), was not significantly associated with cortical excitability (r = 0.14, P = 0.25). Importantly, no significant association was found between early Aβ cortical deposits and cortical excitability (r = -0.20, P = 0.11).CONCLUSIONThese findings reveal potential brain substrates for increased cortical excitability in preclinical AD and may constitute functional in vivo correlates of early brainstem tau accumulation and neuroinflammation in humans.TRIAL REGISTRATIONEudraCT 2016-001436-35.FUNDINGF.R.S.-FNRS Belgium, Wallonie-Bruxelles International, ULiège, Fondation Simone et Pierre Clerdent, European Regional Development Fund.

Alpha desynchronization during simple working memory unmasks pathological aging in cognitively healthy individuals.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0208517	Our aim is to explore if cognitive challenge combined with objective physiology can reveal abnormal frontal alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD), in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to investigate brain activities during N-back working memory (WM) processing at two different load conditions (N = 0 or 2) in an aging cohort. We studied 60-100 year old participants, with normal cognition, and who fits one of two subgroups from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins: cognitively healthy (CH) with normal amyloid/tau ratio (CH-NAT, n = 10) or pathological amyloid/tau ratio (CH-PAT, n = 14). We recorded behavioral performances, and analyzed alpha power and alpha spectral entropy (SE) at three occasions: during the resting state, and at event-related desynchronization (ERD) [250 ~ 750 ms] during 0-back and 2-back. During 0-back WM testing, the behavioral performance was similar between the two groups, however, qEEG notably differentiated CH-PATs from CH-NATs on the simple, 0-back testing: Alpha ERD decreased from baseline only in the parietal region in CH-NATs, while it decreased in all brain regions in CH-PATs. Alpha SE did not change in CH-NATs, but was increased from baseline in the CH-PATs in frontal and left lateral regions (p<0.01), and was higher in the frontal region (p<0.01) of CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs. The alpha ERD and SE analyses suggest there is frontal lobe dysfunction during WM processing in the CH-PAT stage. Additional power and correlations with behavioral performance were also explored. This study provide pilot information to further evaluate whether this biomarker has clinical significance.

Slow wave sleep disruption increases cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β levels.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awx148	See Mander et al. (doi:10.1093/awx174) for a scientific commentary on this article.Sleep deprivation increases amyloid-β, suggesting that chronically disrupted sleep may promote amyloid plaques and other downstream Alzheimer's disease pathologies including tauopathy or inflammation. To date, studies have not examined which aspect of sleep modulates amyloid-β or other Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. Seventeen healthy adults (age 35-65 years) without sleep disorders underwent 5-14 days of actigraphy, followed by slow wave activity disruption during polysomnogram, and cerebrospinal fluid collection the following morning for measurement of amyloid-β, tau, total protein, YKL-40, and hypocretin. Data were compared to an identical protocol, with a sham condition during polysomnogram. Specific disruption of slow wave activity correlated with an increase in amyloid-β40 (r = 0.610, P = 0.009). This effect was specific for slow wave activity, and not for sleep duration or efficiency. This effect was also specific to amyloid-β, and not total protein, tau, YKL-40, or hypocretin. Additionally, worse home sleep quality, as measured by sleep efficiency by actigraphy in the six nights preceding lumbar punctures, was associated with higher tau (r = 0.543, P = 0.045). Slow wave activity disruption increases amyloid-β levels acutely, and poorer sleep quality over several days increases tau. These effects are specific to neuronally-derived proteins, which suggests they are likely driven by changes in neuronal activity during disrupted sleep.

Physical exercise protects against Alzheimer's disease in 3xTg-AD mice.	DOI: 10.3233/JAD-2011-101635	Physical exercise is considered to exert a positive neurophysiological effect that helps to maintain normal brain activity in the elderly. Expectations that it could help to fight Alzheimer's disease (AD) were recently raised. This study analyzed the effects of different patterns of physical exercise on the 3xTg-AD mouse. Male and female 3xTg-AD mice at an early pathological stage (4-month-old) have had free access to a running wheel for 1 month, whereas mice at a moderate pathological stage(7-month-old) have had access either during 1 or 6 months. The non-transgenic mouse strain was used as a control. Parallel animal groups were housed in conventional conditions. Cognitive loss and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)-like behaviors were present in the 3xTg-AD mice along with alteration in synaptic function and ong-term potentiation impairment in vivo. Brain tissue showed AD-pathology and oxidative-related changes. Disturbances were more severe at the older age tested. Oxidative stress was higher in males but other changes were similar or higher in females. Exercise treatment ameliorated cognitive deterioration and BPSD-like behaviors such as anxiety and the startle response. Synaptic changes were partially protected by exercise. Oxidative stress was reduced. The best neuroprotection was generally obtained after 6 months of exercise in 7-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. Improved sensorimotor function and brain tissue antioxidant defence were induced in both 3xTg-AD and NonTg mice. Therefore, the benefits of aerobic physical exercise on synapse, redox homeostasis, and general brain function demonstrated in the 3xTg-AD mouse further support the value of this healthy life-style against neurodegeneration.

EEG slowing and cerebrospinal fluid tau levels in patients with cognitive decline.	DOI: 10.1097/00001756-199801050-00032	We explored the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels as indirect markers of tau-related pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and EEG slowing, a typical neurophysiological finding in the disease. A positive correlation between CSF tau levels and ratio of alpha/delta global field power was found in 14 AD patients (r = 0.65, p = 0.01). This relationship was better approximated by polynomial fit of 2nd degree (p = 0.002). A subgroup of AD patients (n = 7) with higher tau levels and shorter duration of illness showed a strong relationship between CSF tau levels and alpha/theta (r = 0.83, p = 0.02), and alpha/delta (r = 0.87, p = 0.01) ratios of the global field power. There were no significant correlations between EEG slowing and CSF tau levels in 12 patients with mild cognitive dysfunction or in 14 healthy control subjects. That a strong inverse linear correlation exists in AD patients with higher levels of tau and shorter duration of illness may imply that with longer illness duration CSF tau levels decrease due to neuronal death.

Synergistic anticholinergic and antiserotonergic effects in humans.	DOI: 10.1080/01688639508405149	Animal research suggests an important interactive role for ascending cholinergic and serotonergic systems in modulation of cerebral function. Employing a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, 11 healthy young adults were tested in each of four conditions: (1) placebo, (2) fenfluramine (a serotonin depleting agent), (3) scopolamine (a muscarinic antagonist), and (4) fenfluramine and scopolamine. P3 latency was slowed by the dual drug treatment to an extent greater than the sum of individual drug effects. EEG mean frequency was decreased by behavioral activation, and this decrease was reversed by the combined drug treatment but not by single drugs. In contrast, verbal memory, EEG alpha power, and P3 amplitude were significantly affected only by scopolamine. No drug effects were found for the N1 and P2 potentials. The results provide the first demonstration of combined anticholinergic and antiserotonergic effects in humans, and offer partial support to the concept of an interactive role of cholinergic and serotonergic systems in cerebral mechanisms.

Effect of the 5-HT(1A) partial agonist buspirone on regional brain electrical activity in man: a functional neuroimaging study using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA).	DOI: 10.1016/s0925-4927(00)00066-4	In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the effects of 20 mg buspirone - a 5-HT(1A) partial agonist - on regional electrical generators within the human brain were investigated utilizing three-dimensional EEG tomography. Nineteen-channel vigilance-controlled EEG recordings were carried out in 20 healthy subjects before and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after drug intake. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA; Key Institute for Brain-Mind Research, software: http://www.keyinst.unizh.ch) was computed from spectrally analyzed EEG data, and differences between drug- and placebo-induced changes were displayed as statistical parametric maps. Data were registered to the Talairach-Tournoux human brain atlas available as a digitized MRI (McConnell Brain Imaging Centre: http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca). At the pharmacodynamic peak (1st hour), buspirone increased theta and decreased fast alpha and beta sources. Areas of theta increase were mainly the left temporo-occipito-parietal and left prefrontal cortices, which is consistent with PET studies on buspirone-induced decreases in regional cerebral blood flow and fenfluramine-induced serotonin activation demonstrated by changes in regional cerebral glucose metabolism. In later hours (8th hour) with lower buspirone plasma levels, delta, theta, slow alpha and fast beta decreased, predominantly in the prefrontal and anterior limbic lobe. Whereas the results of the 1st hour speak for a slight CNS sedation (more in the sense of relaxation), those obtained in the 8th hour indicate activation. Thus, LORETA may provide useful and direct information on drug-induced changes in central nervous system function in man.

Quantitative assessment of the relationship between behavioral and autonomic dynamics during propofol-induced unconsciousness.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0254053	During general anesthesia, both behavioral and autonomic changes are caused by the administration of anesthetics such as propofol. Propofol produces unconsciousness by creating highly structured oscillations in brain circuits. The anesthetic also has autonomic effects due to its actions as a vasodilator and myocardial depressant. Understanding how autonomic dynamics change in relation to propofol-induced unconsciousness is an important scientific and clinical question since anesthesiologists often infer changes in level of unconsciousness from changes in autonomic dynamics. Therefore, we present a framework combining physiology-based statistical models that have been developed specifically for heart rate variability and electrodermal activity with a robust statistical tool to compare behavioral and multimodal autonomic changes before, during, and after propofol-induced unconsciousness. We tested this framework on physiological data recorded from nine healthy volunteers during computer-controlled administration of propofol. We studied how autonomic dynamics related to behavioral markers of unconsciousness: 1) overall, 2) during the transitions of loss and recovery of consciousness, and 3) before and after anesthesia as a whole. Our results show a strong relationship between behavioral state of consciousness and autonomic dynamics. All of our prediction models showed areas under the curve greater than 0.75 despite the presence of non-monotonic relationships among the variables during the transition periods. Our analysis highlighted the specific roles played by fast versus slow changes, parasympathetic vs sympathetic activity, heart rate variability vs electrodermal activity, and even pulse rate vs pulse amplitude information within electrodermal activity. Further advancement upon this work can quantify the complex and subject-specific relationship between behavioral changes and autonomic dynamics before, during, and after anesthesia. However, this work demonstrates the potential of a multimodal, physiologically-informed, statistical approach to characterize autonomic dynamics.

Differential classification of states of consciousness using envelope- and phase-based functional connectivity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118171	"The development of sophisticated computational tools to quantify changes in the brain's oscillatory dynamics across states of consciousness have included both envelope- and phase-based measures of functional connectivity (FC), but there are very few direct comparisons of these techniques using the same dataset. The goal of this study was to compare an envelope-based (i.e. Amplitude Envelope Correlation, AEC) and a phase-based (i.e. weighted Phase Lag Index, wPLI) measure of FC in their classification of states of consciousness. Nine healthy participants underwent a three-hour experimental anesthetic protocol with propofol induction and isoflurane maintenance, in which five minutes of 128-channel electroencephalography were recorded before, during, and after anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, at the following time points: Baseline; light sedation with propofol (Light Sedation); deep unconsciousness following three hours of surgical levels of anesthesia with isoflurane (Unconscious); five minutes prior to the recovery of consciousness (Pre-ROC); and three hours following the recovery of consciousness (Recovery). Support vector machine classification was applied to the source-localized EEG in the alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency band in order to investigate the ability of AEC and wPLI (separately and together) to discriminate i) the four states from Baseline; ii) Unconscious (""deep"" unconsciousness) vs. Pre-ROC (""light"" unconsciousness); and iii) responsiveness (Baseline, Light Sedation, Recovery) vs. unresponsiveness (Unconscious, Pre-ROC). AEC and wPLI yielded different patterns of global connectivity across states of consciousness, with AEC showing the strongest network connectivity during the Unconscious epoch, and wPLI showing the strongest connectivity during full consciousness (i.e., Baseline and Recovery). Both measures also demonstrated differential predictive contributions across participants and used different brain regions for classification. AEC showed higher classification accuracy overall, particularly for distinguishing anesthetic-induced unconsciousness from Baseline (83.7 ± 0.8%). AEC also showed stronger classification accuracy than wPLI when distinguishing Unconscious from Pre-ROC (i.e., ""deep"" from ""light"" unconsciousness) (AEC: 66.3 ± 1.2%; wPLI: 56.2 ± 1.3%), and when distinguishing between responsiveness and unresponsiveness (AEC: 76.0 ± 1.3%; wPLI: 63.6 ± 1.8%). Classification accuracy was not improved compared to AEC when both AEC and wPLI were combined. This analysis of source-localized EEG data demonstrates that envelope- and phase-based FC provide different information about states of consciousness but that, on a group level, AEC is better able to detect relative alterations in brain FC across levels of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness compared to wPLI."

Altered Global Brain Signal during Physiologic, Pharmacologic, and Pathologic States of Unconsciousness in Humans and Rats.	DOI: 10.1097/ALN.0000000000003197	Consciousness is supported by integrated brain activity across widespread functionally segregated networks. The functional magnetic resonance imaging-derived global brain signal is a candidate marker for a conscious state, and thus the authors hypothesized that unconsciousness would be accompanied by a loss of global temporal coordination, with specific patterns of decoupling between local regions and global activity differentiating among various unconscious states.

MOTANA: study protocol to investigate motor cerebral activity during a propofol sedation.	DOI: 10.1186/s13063-019-3596-9	Accidental Accidental awareness during general anesthesia (AAGA) occurs in 1-2% of high-risk practice patients and is a cause of severe psychological trauma, termed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, no monitoring techniques can accurately predict or detect AAGA. Since the first reflex for a patient during AAGA is to move, a passive brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the detection of an intention of movement would be conceivable to alert the anesthetist. However, the way in which propofol (i.e., an anesthetic commonly used for the general anesthesia induction) affects motor brain activity within the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal has been poorly investigated and is not clearly understood. For this reason, a detailed study of the motor activity behavior with a step-wise increasing dose of propofol is required and would provide a proof of concept for such an innovative BCI. The main goal of this study is to highlight the occurrence of movement attempt patterns, mainly changes in oscillations called event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS), in the EEG signal over the motor cortex, in healthy subjects, without and under propofol sedation, during four different motor tasks.

Correlation of EEG spectral entropy with regional cerebral blood flow during sevoflurane and propofol anaesthesia.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2044.2005.04289.x	ENTROPY index monitoring, based on spectral entropy of the electroencephalogram, is a promising new method to measure the depth of anaesthesia. We examined the association between spectral entropy and regional cerebral blood flow in healthy subjects anaesthetised with 2%, 3% and 4% end-expiratory concentrations of sevoflurane and 7.6, 12.5 and 19.0 microg.ml(-1) plasma drug concentrations of propofol. Spectral entropy from the frequency band 0.8-32 Hz was calculated and cerebral blood flow assessed using positron emission tomography and [(15)O]-labelled water at baseline and at each anaesthesia level. Both drugs induced significant reductions in spectral entropy and cortical and global cerebral blood flow. Midfrontal-central spectral entropy was associated with individual frontal and whole brain blood flow values across all conditions, suggesting that this novel measure of anaesthetic depth can depict global changes in neuronal activity induced by the drugs. The cortical areas of the most significant associations were remarkably similar for both drugs.

Sevoflurane and propofol increase 11C-flumazenil binding to gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors in humans.	DOI: 10.1213/01.ANE.0000135409.81842.31	Based on in vitro studies and animal data, most anesthetics are supposed to act via gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors. However, this fundamental characteristic has not been extensively investigated in humans. We studied (11)C-flumazenil binding to GABA(A) receptors during sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia in the living human brain using positron emission tomography (PET). Fourteen healthy male subjects underwent 2 60-min dynamic PET studies with (11)C-labeled flumazenil, awake and during anesthesia. Anesthesia was maintained with 2% end-tidal sevoflurane (n = 7) or propofol at a target plasma concentration of 9.0 +/- 3.0 (mean +/- sd) microg/mL (n = 7). The depth of anesthesia was measured with bispectral index (BIS). Values of regional distribution volumes (DV) of (11)C-flumazenil were calculated in several brain areas using metabolite-corrected arterial plasma curves and a two-compartment model. Separate voxel-based statistical analysis using parametric DV images was performed for detailed visualization. The average BIS index was 35 +/- 6 in the sevoflurane group and 28 +/- 8 in the propofol group (P = 0.02). Sevoflurane increased the DV of (11)C-flumazenil significantly (P < 0.05) in all brain areas studied except the pons and the white matter. In the propofol group the increases were significant (P < 0.05) in the caudatus, putamen, cerebellum, thalamus and the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Furthermore, the DV increases in the frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal cortical areas and in the putamen were statistically significantly larger in the sevoflurane than in the propofol group. Our findings support the involvement of GABA(A) receptors in the mechanism of action of both anesthetics in humans.

PET quantification of muscarinic cholinergic receptors with [N-11C-methyl]-benztropine and application to studies of propofol-induced unconsciousness in healthy human volunteers.	DOI: 10.1002/syn.10292	This work evaluated kinetic analysis methods for estimation of the receptor availability of the muscarinic receptor using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with [N-(11)C-methyl]-benztropine. The study also investigated the effect of propofol on central muscarinic receptor availability during general anesthesia. Six volunteers were scanned three times, once for baseline while awake, once during unconsciousness, and once after recovery to conscious level. An irreversible two-tissue compartment model was used to estimate the [N-(11)C-methyl]-benztropine specific binding rate constant k(3), a measure of muscarinic receptor availability. Two different estimation methods were used: 1) optimization with positivity constraints on all the parameters; 2) optimization with additional constraints determined from a one-tissue compartment fit to the cerebellum. In regions with low to middle muscarinic receptor density, the k(3) values from method (2) had lower standard errors than that for method (1) and gave a higher correlation with the density of muscarinic receptors measured in human tissue by in vitro studies (r(2) of 0.98 for Method 2 and r(2) of 0.72 for Method 1). But the k(3) values determined by Method 2 had higher errors for regions with high muscarinic receptor density compared to Method 1. For both methods the mean k(3) values during unconsciousness were generally lower than those during awake for most regions evaluated. Therefore, the method with additional constraints derived from the cerebellum (Method 2) was deemed superior for regions with low to middle muscarinic receptor density, while the method with positivity constraint is the better choice in the regions with high muscarinic receptor density. Our results also suggest the existence of propofol-related reductions in muscarinic receptor availability.

Brimonidine eye drops reveal diminished sympathetic pupillary tone in comatose patients with brain injury.	DOI: 10.1007/s00701-023-05569-8	There is an urgent need for easy-to-perform bedside measures to detect residual consciousness in clinically unresponsive patients with acute brain injury. Interestingly, the sympathetic control of pupil size is thought to be lost in states of unconsciousness. We therefore hypothesized that administration of brimonidine (an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist) eye drops into one eye should produce a pharmacologic Horner's syndrome if the clinically unresponsive patient is conscious, but not if the patient is unconscious. Here, in a first step to explore this hypothesis, we investigated the potential of brimonidine eye drops to distinguish preserved sympathetic pupillary function in awake volunteers from impairment of sympathetic tone in patients in a coma.

The maternal immune activation model uncovers a role for the Arx gene in GABAergic dysfunction in schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bbi.2019.06.009	A hallmark feature of schizophrenia is altered high frequency neural oscillations, including reduced auditory-evoked gamma oscillatory power, which is underpinned by parvalbumin (PV) interneuron dysfunction. Maternal immune activation (MIA) in rodents models an environmental risk factor for schizophrenia and recapitulates these PV interneuron changes. This study sought to link reduced PV expression in the MIA model with alterations to auditory-evoked gamma oscillations and transcript expression. We further aligned transcriptional findings from the animal model with human genome sequencing data. We show that MIA, induced by the viral mimetic, poly-I:C in C57Bl/6 mice, caused in adult offspring reduced auditory-evoked gamma and theta oscillatory power paralleled by reduced PV protein levels. We then showed the Arx gene, critical to healthy neurodevelopment of PV interneurons, is reduced in the forebrain of MIA exposed mice. Finally, in a whole-genome sequenced patient cohort, we identified a novel missense mutation of ARX in a patient with schizophrenia and in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium 2 cohort, a nominal association of proximal ARX SNPs with the disorder. This suggests MIA, as a risk factor for schizophrenia, may be influencing Arx expression to induce the GABAergic dysfunction seen in schizophrenia and that the ARX gene may play a role in the prenatal origins of schizophrenia pathophysiology.

Effects of Prebiotic Yeast Mannan on Gut Health and Sleep Quality in Healthy Adults: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.	DOI: 10.3390/nu16010141	Human gut health is closely related to sleep. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of yeast mannan (YM) in improving bowel habits and sleep quality, along with metabolomics in fecal samples. A total of 40 healthy adults (age range, 22-64 years) with discomfort in defecation were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive either YM (n = 20; 1.1 g/day) or placebo (n = 20) for four weeks. Participants recorded their defecation habits throughout the test periods. Sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using an EEG device and fecal sampling were performed pre- and post-treatment. The YM group significantly increased defecation frequency and stool volumes compared to the placebo group. After 4 weeks of treatment, the non-REM sleep stage 3 (N3) duration in the YM group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group. YM ingestion significantly lengthened total time in bed (TIB) and significantly shortened N3 latency compared to placebo intake during the trial. The metabolomics analysis found a total of 20 metabolite differences between the YM and placebo groups. As a result of stepwise linear regression, changes in fecal propionate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were identified as the primary factors explaining changes in TIB and N3 latency, respectively. Our findings suggest that the prebiotic YM could be beneficial to gut health and sleep quality.

EEG changes as an indication of central nervous system involvement following cyclopentolate 1% eye drops; a randomized placebo-controlled pilot study in a pediatric population.	DOI: 10.1080/09273972.2023.2218455	To compare EEG-patterns after instillation of cyclopentolate versus placebo eye drops. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, and observational pilot study is presented. Ophthalmology outpatient clinic Dutch metropolitan hospital. Healthy 6- to 15-year-old volunteers with normal or low BMI requiring a cycloplegic refraction/retinoscopy. Randomized; 1 visit 2 drops cyclopentolate-1% and 1 visit 2 drops placebo (saline-0.9%). Single-blind: conducting researcher. Double blind: subjects, parents, clinical-neurophysiology staff, neurologist, and statistician. A 10-min baseline EEG-recording, drop-application, and follow-up to at least 45 min. Primary outcome: Detection of CNS changes, i.e. EEG-pattern changes, following two drops of cyclopentolate-1%. Secondary outcome: Determination of the extent of these pattern changes. Thirty-six cyclopentolate-1% saline-0.9% EEG registrations were made in 33 subjects;  18 males and 15 females. Three subjects were tested twice (interval 7 months). Nine out of fourteen (64%) of the 11- to 15-year-old children reported impaired memory, attention, alertness, as well as mind wandering following cyclopentolate. Drowsiness and sleep were seen in EEG-recordings of 11 subjects (33%) following cyclopentolate. We observed no drowsiness nor sleep during placebo recordings. The mean time to drowsiness was 23 min. Nine subjects arrived in stage-3 sleep but none arrived in REM-sleep. In subjects without sleep (N=24), significant changes compared to placebo-EEG were present for many leads and parameters. The main findings during awake eye-open recording were as follows: 1) a significant increase of temporal Beta-1,2 and 3-power, and 2) a significant decrease in: a) the parietal and occipital Alpha-2-power, b) the frontal Delta-1-power, c) the frontal total power, and d) the occipital and parietal activation synchrony index. The former finding reflects cyclopentolate uptake in the CNS, and the latter findings provide evidence for CNS suppression. Cyclopentolate-1% eye drops can affect the CNS and may cause altered consciousness, drowsiness, and sleep with concomitant EEG results in both young children and children in puberty. There is evidence that cyclopentolate has the potency to act as a short acting CNS depressant. Nevertheless, however, cyclopentolate-1% can safely be used in children and young adolescents.

Bretazenil modulates sleep EEG and nocturnal hormone secretion in normal men.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02246085	Preclinical data suggest that the imidazodiazepinone derivative bretazenil (Ro 16-6028) has anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties with only weak sedative effects. We examined the influence of oral administration of 1 mg bretazenil on the sleep EEG and the concomitant nocturnal secretion of cortisol, growth hormone and prolactin in ten healthy young men. After bretazenil we found a significant increase in stage 2 sleep and a significant reduction in stage 3 sleep. REM latency was prolonged. Spectral analysis of sleep-EEG power revealed a decrease in delta and in theta power and an increase in sigma power.

Effects of bretazenil vs. zolpidem and placebo on experimentally induced sleep disturbance in healthy volunteers.		The effects of bretazenil 0.25 and 0.5 mg, a partial agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, on sleep electroencephalogram (EEG), subjective sleep quality and morning psychomotor performance were compared to zolpidem 10 mg and placebo using noise as an experimental sleep disturbing factor in a single dose, double-blind, crossover study. Twelve healthy volunteers were subjected to prerecorded traffic noise with a mean sound level of 52 dB(A) during eight hours in bed. Significant effects of noise were found on sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters (rapid eye movement [REM] sleep, stage 2 sleep and number of arousals), and subjective sleep quality assessments, but not on psychomotor performance (choice reaction time, digit span memory, and symbol digit substitution). Both drugs reduced the number of shifts between sleep stages and the number of arousals and increased REM sleep latency. Only after 0.5 mg bretazenil, stage 2 sleep increased and REM sleep decreased. Both doses of bretazenil significantly affected performance in the symbol digit substitution test. Sleep quality improved under drug treatments compared to placebo. The results suggest that experimental sleep disturbance can be a valuable tool in the investigation of potential sleep promoting compounds.

Effects of hypericum extract LI 160 compared with maprotiline on resting EEG and evoked potentials in 24 volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/089198879400700112	In a randomized double-blind study, the effect of hypericum extract was compared to that of maprotiline in 24 healthy volunteers. The investigations included measurements of resting EEG as well as visual and acoustic evoked potentials. In resting EEGs, both medications revealed oppositely directed changes in the theta frequencies, and mainly similarly directed changes in alpha and beta frequencies. Measurements of evoked potentials in the theta and beta frequencies supported these results. The results indicate improved cognitive functions mainly with the treatment of hypericum extract.

Effects of hypericum extract on the sleep EEG in older volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/089198879400700111	The effects of treatment with high doses (300 mg three times daily) of hypericum extract LI 160 on sleep quality and well-being were investigated over a 4-week period. The double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted with 12 older, healthy volunteers in a cross-over design, which included a 2-week wash-out phase between both treatment phases. A hypostatic influence of the REM sleep phases, which is typical for tricyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors, could not be shown for this phytopharmacon. Instead, LI 160 induced an increase of deep sleep during the total sleeping period. This could be shown consistently in the visual analysis of the sleeping phases 3 and 4, as well as in the automatic analysis of slow-wave EEG activities. The continuity of sleep was not improved by LI 160; this was also the case for the onset of the sleep, the intermittent wake-up phases, and total sleep duration.

Brain Network Activation (BNA) reveals scopolamine-induced impairment of visual working memory.	DOI: 10.1007/s12031-014-0250-6	The overarching goal of this event-related potential (ERP) study was to examine the effects of scopolamine on the dynamics of brain network activation using a novel ERP network analysis method known as Brain Network Activation (BNA). BNA was used for extracting group-common stimulus-activated network patterns elicited to matching probe stimuli in the context of a delayed matching-to-sample task following placebo and scopolamine treatments administered to healthy participants. The BNA extracted networks revealed the existence of two pathophysiological mechanisms following scopolamine, disconnection, and compensation. Specifically, weaker frontal theta and parietal alpha coupling was accompanied with enhanced fronto-centro-parietal theta activation relative to placebo. In addition, using the characteristic BNA network of each treatment as well as corresponding literature-guided selective subnetworks as combined biomarkers managed to differentiate between individual responses to each of the treatments. Behavioral effects associated with scopolamine included delayed response time and impaired response accuracy. These results indicate that the BNA method is sensitive to the effects of scopolamine on working memory and that it may potentially enable diagnosis and treatment assessment of dysfunctions associated with cholinergic deficiency.

EEG changes following scopolamine administration in healthy subjects. Quantitative analysis during rest and photic stimulation.	DOI: 10.1159/000026588	This study examined the effects of the anticholinergic drug, scopolamine (0.25 mg) in 16 right-handed healthy volunteers. EEGs were recorded before and 60 min after intramuscular administration, and spectral analysis was performed on EEGs recorded at rest and during photic stimulation. Each subject was also evaluated by the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS; form 1 or 2) before and 90 min after drug administration. In the resting EEG, the scopolamine administration resulted in a significant increase in the absolute power on the delta band (2.0- 3.8 Hz) and in the relative power on the delta and theta-1 bands (4.0-5.8 Hz) mainly over the central and parieto-occipital regions. In contrast, scopolamine significantly decreased the relative alpha-2 band (9.2-12.8 Hz) power mainly over the frontal regions and the absolute alpha-2 band power at most of the recording sites. The analysis of stimulus data showed that scopolamine significantly decreased fundamental photic driving responses elicited by photic stimulation at 15 Hz, with significant effects confined to the occipital regions. These EEG changes occurred in association with a significant reduction in total WMS scores as well as in scores of logical and visual memory subtests. These findings suggest that, in addition to cognitive impairments, central cholinergic dysfunction can cause EEG changes under both nonstimulus and stimulus conditions.

Localization of scopolamine induced electrocortical brain activity changes, in healthy humans at rest.	DOI: 10.1002/jcph.83	To prevent the participants of parabolic flights from nausea they are optionally treated with subcutaneously injected antiemetic scopolamine. The range of side effects of this substance include reductions of the α-2 frequency band. Previous studies, however, have given no information as to which generator centers are responsible for this effect. The objective of this study therefore, is to identify the cortex area that may be responsible for this effect. Six participants were subcutaneously administered 0.7 mg of scopolamine. EEG was recorded for 10 minutes before to 20 minutes after injection. Data preprocessing followed including filtering and artifact minimization. A statistical analysis was performed with sLORETA/eLORETA software for each subject over a time window from 3 minutes before to 17-20 minutes after scopolamine injection. Results show, that in the BA7, the precuneus, on both hemispheres suffered a α-2 activity decrease in absolute power. The identified brain cortex center is an important hub with high connectivity and centrality values within the neural network. It contributes to the control of movement and to space orientation. Therefore, an activity alteration in this area can possibly explain the antiemetic effect of scopolamine and open a window to understand the origin of motion sickness.

The effects of the glycine reuptake inhibitor R213129 on the central nervous system and on scopolamine-induced impairments in psychomotor and cognitive function in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881109106942	In this study the effects of R213129, a selective glycine transporter 1 inhibitor, on central nervous system function were investigated in healthy males in the absence and presence of scopolamine. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-period crossover ascending dose study evaluating the following endpoints: body sway, saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements, pupillometry, electroencephalography, visual analogue scales for alertness, mood, calmness and psychedelic effects, adaptive tracking, finger tapping, Visual and Verbal Learning Task, Stroop test, hormone levels and pharmacokinetics. R213129 dose levels were selected based on exposure levels that blocked the GlyT1 sites >50% in preclinical experiments. Forty-three of the 45 included subjects completed the study. Scopolamine significantly affected almost every central nervous system parameter measured in this study. R213129 alone compared with placebo did not elicit pharmacodynamic changes. R213129 had some small effects on scopolamine-induced central nervous system impairments. Scopolamine-induced finger tapping impairment was further enhanced by 3 mg R213129 with 2.0 taps/10 seconds (95% CI -4.0, -0.1), electroencephalography alpha power was increased by 10 mg R213129 with respectively 12.9% (0.7, 26.6%), scopolamine-induced impairment of the Stroop test was partly reversed by 10 mg R213129 with 59 milliseconds (-110, -7). Scopolamine produced robust and consistent effects in psychomotor and cognitive function in healthy volunteers. The most logical reason for the lack of R213129 effects seems to be that the central nervous system concentrations were too low. The effects of higher doses in healthy volunteers and the clinical efficacy in patients remain to be established.

Human flash-VEP and quantitative EEG are independently affected by acute scopolamine.	DOI: 10.1016/0013-4694(93)90109-9	Scopolamine in acute intramuscular doses of 0.25-0.75 mg reduced the P2-N3 flash-VEP amplitude and, in the quantitative EEG, the 8.5-12.0 Hz power and total power in 8 healthy young male volunteers. The effects on flash-VEP and EEG total power were dose dependent and were evident 30 min and 90 min respectively after drug administration, regardless of dose. The reduction in 8.5-12.0 Hz power was limited to the 0.50 and 0.75 mg doses. No systematic effects on the pattern-VEP were observed. Possible interferences with flash- or pattern-VEP amplitude of the scopolamine-induced EEG changes were identified and removed by regression analysis and computation of VEP residuals from the regression function. The P2-N3 flash-VEP residuals proved EEG independent and showed relationships with dose and time after drug administration that were superimposable on those of the original data, with comparable significance levels at the drug/placebo and pre/postdrug statistical comparisons. The results indicate that VEP estimates of drug effects which are independent from EEG changes can be identified in human studies and allow some inference on the cholinergic specificity of the systems affecting late flash-VEP components. The statistical approach used in this study is suitable for application in VEP studies when effects of interacting factors are to be expected.

Effects of scopolamine on interhemispheric EEG coherence in healthy subjects: analysis during rest and photic stimulation.	DOI: 10.1177/155005940003100210	The present study of coherence analysis, in 16 healthy male volunteers, aged 24-31 years, showed that the administration of 0.25 mg of scopolamine significantly reduced interhemispheric coherence in the delta and beta-1 bands in the resting state. Scopolamine also caused a significant increase both in EEG coherence during PS and in PS-related coherence reactivity in the beta band. In addition, this compound significantly reduced total WMS scores. These findings suggest that, in addition to causing cognitive impairments, central cholinergic dysfunction can alter interhemispheric functional connectivity under both nonstimulus and stimulus conditions.

Age and cholinergic effects on hemodynamics and functional coherence of human hippocampus.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2005.08.011	Aging is normally associated with increased predictability of neurophysiological processes. To test the related prediction of age-related increase in the Hurst exponent, H, of functional MRI time series, and its possible cholinergic mechanisms, two groups of healthy participants (old [mean age = 65 years]; young [mean age = 22 years]; N = 11 per group) were scanned twice at rest, following placebo and a muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine 0.3 mg. Older age was associated with significant increase in H of fMRI time series in bilateral hippocampus. Similarly, scopolamine was associated with increased H in left hippocampus; and there was an age-by-drug interaction in medial temporal lobe whereby older participants specifically had increased H following scopolamine. Scopolamine also enhanced fronto-hippocampal low-frequency coherence, and this could be correlated with its effect on hippocampal H. Thus, increased persistence of hippocampal dynamics in older subjects is demonstrable by resting fMRI; scopolamine mimics these effects, especially in older subjects, implying a cholinergic mechanism for age-related change; and cholinergic effects on hippocampal dynamics are associated with enhanced functional connectivity between frontal cortex and hippocampus.

EEG machine learning for accurate detection of cholinergic intervention and Alzheimer's disease.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-06165-4	Monitoring effects of disease or therapeutic intervention on brain function is increasingly important for clinical trials, albeit hampered by inter-individual variability and subtle effects. Here, we apply complementary biomarker algorithms to electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to capture the brain's multi-faceted signature of disease or pharmacological intervention and use machine learning to improve classification performance. Using data from healthy subjects receiving scopolamine we developed an index of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (mAChR) consisting of 14 EEG biomarkers. This mAChR index yielded higher classification performance than any single EEG biomarker with cross-validated accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision ranging from 88-92%. The mAChR index also discriminated healthy elderly from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, an index optimized for AD pathophysiology provided a better classification. We conclude that integrating multiple EEG biomarkers can enhance the accuracy of identifying disease or drug interventions, which is essential for clinical trials.

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of the electroencephalogram effects of scopolamine in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/00912700122009836	"Scopolamine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist commonly used as a pharmacological model substance based on the ""cholinergic hypothesis"" of memory loss in senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. The objective of the study was to relate pharmacodynamic electroencephalogram (EEG) changes and scopolamine serum concentration using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling techniques. This was a randomized, three-way crossover, open-label study involving 10 healthy nonsmoking young male volunteers who received either scopolamine 0.5 mg as an intravenous (i.v.) infusion over 15 minutes or an intramuscular (i.m.) injection or a placebo. The pharmacodynamic EEG measure consists of the total power in delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands over frontal, central, and occipital brain areas. The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters of scopolamine after i.v. infusion were clearance (CL) 205 +/- 36.6 L/h, volume of distribution (Vd) 363 +/- 66.7 L, distribution half-life (t1/2 alpha) 2.9 +/- 0.67 min, and terminal half-life (t1/2 beta) 105.4 +/- 9.94 min (mean +/- SEM). Mean peak serum concentrations (Cmax) were 4.66 and 0.96 ng/ml after i.v. and i.m. administration, respectively (p < 0.05). The area under the serum concentration versus time curve (AUC) after i.m. administration (81.27 +/- 11.21 ng/ml/min) was significantly lower compared to the value after i.v. infusion (157.28 +/- 30.86 ng/ml/min) (mean +/- SEM, p < 0.05). Absolute bioavailability of scopolamine after i.m. injection was 57% +/- 0.08% (mean +/- SEM). After both i.v. and i.m. administration, scopolamine induced a decrease in EEG alpha power (7.50-11.25 Hz) over frontal, central, and occipital brain areas compared to placebo (p < 0.05). The individual concentration-EEG effect relationships determined after i.v. infusion of scopolamine were successfully characterized by a sigmoidal Emax model. The averaged values of the pharmacodynamic parameters were E0 = 0.58 microV2, Emax = 0.29 microV2, EC50 = 0.60 ng/ml, and gamma = 1.17. No time delay between serum concentrations and changes in alpha power was observed, indicating a rapid equilibration between serum and effect site. The results provide the first demonstration of a direct correlation between serum concentrations of scopolamine and changes in total power in alpha frequency band in healthy volunteers using PK-PD modeling techniques. As regards the effect on the EEG, 0.5 mg of scopolamine administered i.v. appears to be a suitable dose."

Utilization of a two-channel, microprocessor-based EEG device for monitoring cognitively vulnerable patients.	DOI: 10.1177/089198879000300306	Several experiments were conducted to validate the use of a two-channel microprocessor-based electroencephalographic (EEG) device for detecting changes in EEG background rhythm in the clinic or at the bedside. The reliability of background measures in healthy individuals was evaluated by obtaining EEG data on 20 control subjects on two occasions separated by at least 1 day. The sensitivity to an experimental toxic encephalopathy was evaluated using measures of EEG and the Buschke Memory Selective Reminding Test after the administration of scopolamine hydrobromide, 0.86 mg subcutaneously, to three healthy volunteers. Postdrug measures of the EEG showed significant group differences from controls at 1 and 2 hours for relative alpha and relative theta power. The drug-induced change for each individual exceeded the predicted range calculated from data on control subjects. These findings suggest the feasibility and the potential utility of this method. This approach was extended to the elderly with measures on 102 subjects (average age, 85 years) living in an institutional setting. EEG measures in the population were of acceptable reliability and were significantly correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (r = -.375 for theta and .357 for beta). Preliminary findings suggest that this method may detect metabolic encephalopathies in the elderly. The study demonstrates the potential value of this approach and suggests the need for further research.

The effects of a glycine reuptake inhibitor R231857 on the central nervous system and on scopolamine-induced impairments in cognitive and psychomotor function in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881109105573	The effects of the selective inhibitor of the glycine transporter 1, R231857, in development for schizophrenia, on the central nervous system (CNS) were investigated in healthy males in the absence and presence of scopolamine. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period crossover ascending dose study. Pharmacokinetics, body sway, saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements, pupillometry, pharmacoelectroencephalogram (EEG), Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for alertness, mood, calmness and psychedelic effects, adaptive tracking, finger tapping, Stroop test, Visual and Verbal Learning Task (VVLT) and hormone levels were assessed. R231857 was administered alone and together with scopolamine to investigate the potential reversal of anticholinergic CNS impairment by the glycine reuptake inhibitor. Forty-two of the 45 included subjects completed the study. Scopolamine significantly affected almost every CNS parameter measured in this study. R231857 alone showed some pharmacodynamic changes compared with placebo. Although these effects might be an indication that R231857 penetrated the CNS, they were not consistent or dose-related. R231857 had some small effects on scopolamine-induced CNS-impairment, which were also not clearly dependent on dose. Scopolamine proved to be an accurate, reproducible and safe model to induce CNS impairment by an anticholinergic mechanism.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of scopolamine after subcutaneous administration.	DOI: 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1998.tb04812.x	The effects of subcutaneously administered scopolamine on quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) and cognitive performance were evaluated and correlated with pharmacokinetic parameters in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of 10 healthy male volunteers. Changes in qEEG and cognition were determined for 8 hours after drug administration. Scopolamine produced dose- and time-dependent impairments of attention and memory and a time-dependent increase in delta power (1.25-4.50 Hz) and a decrease in fast alpha power (9.75-12.50 Hz) on qEEG compared with placebo. Maximum serum concentrations of scopolamine occurred 10 to 30 minutes after drug administration. Mean peak serum concentrations (free base) were 3.27, 8.99, and 18.81 ng/mL after administration of 0.4, 0.6 mg, and 0.8 mg scopolamine, respectively. Elimination half-life was approximately 220 minutes. The findings indicate temporary changes in qEEG and psychometric tests, and support the possible use of such a testing model for impaired cognitive functions such as age-related memory disturbances.

Effects of scopolamine on visual evoked potentials in aging and dementia.	DOI: 10.1016/0168-5597(91)90081-8	The unusual combination of a normal pattern reversal VEP and a delayed flash VEP has been reported in patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT). Hyoscine hydrobromide has been reported to produce a similar VEP abnormality in young, healthy subjects. In the present study, we assessed the relative sensitivity of DAT patients and healthy young, middle-aged and elderly subjects to temporary cholinergic blockade. We report VEP latency values following 3 doses of scopolamine and after a peripheral anticholinergic agent. Flash P2 latency was not significantly slower in DAT patients than in the healthy elderly. Scopolamine increased P2 latency in the young controls but did not affect any other group. The pattern reversal P100 was normal in DAT, and a significant increase in latency occurred following scopolamine administration in both the control and patient groups.

Magnesium sulphate only slightly reduces the shivering threshold in humans.	DOI: 10.1093/bja/aei105	Hypothermia may be an effective treatment for stroke or acute myocardial infarction; however, it provokes vigorous shivering, which causes potentially dangerous haemodynamic responses and prevents further hypothermia. Magnesium is an attractive anti-shivering agent because it is used for treatment of postoperative shivering and provides protection against ischaemic injury in animal models. We tested the hypothesis that magnesium reduces the threshold (triggering core temperature) and gain of shivering without substantial sedation or muscle weakness.

Quantitative analysis of EEG effects following experimental marginal magnesium and boron deprivation.		Magnesium (115 and 315 mg/d) and boron (0.23 and 3.23 mg/d) were fed in a double-blind Latin squares design to 13 healthy postmenopausal women (aged 50-78 years) living on a metabolic unit. An eight-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during the last week of each of four 6-week dietary periods. Power and coherence measures were determined for each of four EEG frequency bands: delta (1-3 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (13-18 Hz). Compared to high dietary magnesium, the low magnesium intake increased total power in the frontal regions and right temporal and parietal regions and resulted in frequency-specific increases in left occipital delta power, theta power in all but the left temporal region, alpha power in the right frontal and right temporal regions, and beta power in the frontal regions. The proportion of theta to total power in the parietal regions also increased with the low magnesium intake. While magnesium effects were observed primarily during eyes-closed conditions, effects of dietary boron on EEG power were found only during eyes-open conditions. Relative to high dietary boron, the low boron intake increased delta power in the left parietal and left occipital regions, increased the proportion of delta to total power in the frontal regions, and decreased relative right frontal theta, right frontal alpha, and left frontal beta power. Additional magnesium and boron effects were evident in the measures of EEG coherence. Thus relatively short periods of marginal magnesium and boron deprivation can affect brain function in healthy older women. The findings extend previous qualitative observations of increased CNS activity following severe magnesium deprivation and deficiency to cases of experimentally induced marginal magnesium deficiency, and verify CNS hyperexcitability by quantitative analysis of the EEG.

Serum, CSF, RBC & urinary levels of magnesium & calcium in idiopathic generalised tonic clonic seizures.		Serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urinary levels of magnesium and calcium and RBC magnesium levels were studied in 100 patients of idiopathic generalised tonic clonic seizures and 95 healthy controls matched for age and sex. There was a significant reduction in serum, CSF and RBC magnesium levels and a rise in serum and CSF calcium levels in epileptic patients. The 24 h urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium in the epileptics did not differ from controls. Post ictal (within 24 h of seizure) serum and CSF magnesium levels were significantly lower and calcium levels significantly higher as compared to inter ictal levels (4 wk after seizure). There was no correlation between serum magnesium, serum calcium and CSF calcium levels and the frequency, control or duration of fits. Low CSF magnesium levels correlated with increased frequency, poor control and longer duration of fits. Patients with status epilepticus and those in the EEG abnormalities had low CSF magnesium levels.

Predictors of chronicity in alcohol use disorder: an evoked response potential study.	DOI: 10.1080/10550887.2020.1780185	"Evoked response potentials (ERP) can reliably map key neurocognitive processes which are putatively responsible for chronic alcohol use disorder (AUD). Aim of the present study was to study P300 auditory odd ball and N400 visual semantic incongruity paradigm mapping executive functions rubric as a potential biomarker predicting chronicity in AUDs. Methodology: 60 right handed 18 to 54 years age subjects were divided into chronic ""CAD"" and non chronic alcohol dependence ""NAD"" in addition to healthy control ""HC"" (N = 30). Subjects were assessed by Addiction Severity Index (ASI), P300 auditory odd ball paradigm in midline region and visual N400 semantic incongruity task in centro-parietal region in a cross sectional design. Results: All the three groups differed significantly for P300 and N400 amplitude in all the leads with maximum attenuation seen in CAD.

Sleep and neurocognitive functioning in children with eczema.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.01.006	Sleep disruption in childhood is associated with clearly defined deficits in neurocognition and behaviour. Childhood eczema is also a potent cause of sleep disruption though it is unknown whether it too results in neurocognitive deficits. To test this hypothesis, neurocognitive (WISC-IV), parental-reported sleep quality (Sleep Disturbance Scale of Children (SDSC)) and overnight polysomnographic (PSG) data were collected in 21 children with eczema and 20 healthy controls (age range 6-16 years). Children with eczema had worse sleep quality on both PSG (notably increased nocturnal wakefulness, a higher number of stage shifts and a longer latency to REM onset) and parental report. In addition, they demonstrated significant neurocognitive deficits (especially verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning and to a lesser extent working memory) with a composite Full Scale IQ 16 points lower than controls. Parental reported sleep problems but not PSG parameters were correlated with reduced neurocognitive performance. However, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that eczema status was predictive while sleep fragmentation (parental or PSG) was not predictive of neurocognitive performance. As this is the first study to systematically examine neurocognitive functioning in children with eczema and given the finding of significant deficits it merits replication especially given the prevalence of the condition. The unanswered question is whether these cognitive deficits normalise with effective eczema treatment and if this is mediated by improvements in sleep architecture.

Cerebral electrometabolic coupling in disordered and normal states of consciousness.	DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112854	We assess cerebral integrity with cortical and subcortical FDG-PET and cortical electroencephalography (EEG) within the mesocircuit model framework in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoCs). The mesocircuit hypothesis proposes that subcortical activation facilitates cortical function. We find that the metabolic balance of subcortical mesocircuit areas is informative for diagnosis and is associated with four EEG-based power spectral density patterns, cortical metabolism, and α power in healthy controls and patients with a DoC. Last, regional electrometabolic coupling at the cortical level can be identified in the θ and α ranges, showing positive and negative relations with glucose uptake, respectively. This relation is inverted in patients with a DoC, potentially related to altered orchestration of neural activity, and may underlie suboptimal excitability states in patients with a DoC. By understanding the neurobiological basis of the pathophysiology underlying DoCs, we foresee translational value for diagnosis and treatment of patients with a DoC.

18F-FDG-PET glucose hypometabolism pattern in patients with epileptogenic hypothalamic hamartoma.	DOI: 10.1007/s11684-021-0874-1	Epileptogenic hypothalamic hamartoma is characterized by intractable gelastic seizures. A systematic analysis of the overall brain metabolic pattern in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) could facilitate the understanding of the epileptic brain network and the associated brain damage effects of HH. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated 27 patients with epileptogenic HH (8 female patients; age, 2-33 years) by using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. The correlations among tomography result, seizure type, sex, and structural magnetic resonance imaging were assessed. Whole metabolic patterns and voxel-based morphometry findings were assessed by group analysis with healthy controls. Assessment of the whole metabolic pattern in patients with HH revealed several regional metabolic reductions in the cerebrum and an overall metabolic reduction in the cerebellum. In addition, areas showing hypometabolism in the neocortex were more widely distributed ipsilaterally than contralaterally to the HH. Reductions in glucose metabolism and gray matter volume in the neocortex were predominant ipsilateral to the HH. In conclusion, the glucose hypometabolism pattern in patients with epileptogenic HH involved the neocortex, subcortical regions, and cerebellum. The characteristics of glucose hypometabolism differed across seizure type and sex. Reductions in glucose metabolism and structural changes may be based on different mechanisms, but both are likely to occur ipsilateral to the HH in the neocortex. We hypothesized that the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract and cerebro-ponto-cerebellar tract, which are responsible for intercommunication between the cerebral cortex, subcortical regions, and cerebellar regions, may be involved in a pathway related to seizure propagation, particularly gelastic seizures, in patients with HH.

Neural Responses to Heartbeats Detect Residual Signs of Consciousness during Resting State in Postcomatose Patients.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1740-20.2021	The neural monitoring of visceral inputs might play a role in first-person perspective (i.e., the unified viewpoint of subjective experience). In healthy participants, how the brain responds to heartbeats, measured as the heartbeat-evoked response (HER), correlates with perceptual, bodily, and self-consciousness. Here we show that HERs in resting-state EEG data distinguishes between postcomatose male and female human patients (n = 68, split into training and validation samples) with the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and in patients in a minimally conscious state with high accuracy (random forest classifier, 87% accuracy, 96% sensitivity, and 50% specificity in the validation sample). Random EEG segments not locked to heartbeats were useful to predict unconsciousness/consciousness, but HERs were more accurate, indicating that HERs provide specific information on consciousness. HERs also led to more accurate classification than heart rate variability. HER-based consciousness scores correlate with glucose metabolism in the default-mode network node located in the right superior temporal sulcus, as well as with the right ventral occipitotemporal cortex. These results were obtained when consciousness was inferred from brain glucose met`abolism measured with positron emission topography. HERs reflected the consciousness diagnosis based on brain metabolism better than the consciousness diagnosis based on behavior (Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, 77% validation accuracy). HERs thus seem to capture a capacity for consciousness that does not necessarily translate into intentional overt behavior. These results confirm the role of HERs in consciousness, offer new leads for future bedside testing, and highlight the importance of defining consciousness and its neural mechanisms independently from behavior.

Experimental increase of blood glucose alters resting state EEG measures of excitation-inhibition balance.	DOI: 10.1113/EP089211	What is the central question of this study? Glucose is the dominant energy source for the brain. However, little is known about how glucose metabolism impacts the coordination of network activity in the brain in healthy adults. What is the main finding and its importance? We demonstrate that both α oscillations and the aperiodic signal components of the resting EEG are modulated by experimentally elevated blood glucose concentrations. Our findings suggest that glucose increases measures associated with excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance, but that the effect on α oscillations might plateau. Understanding the relationship between glucose consumption and E:I balance is crucial to developing our understanding of how metabolism shapes human brain activity.

Evaluation of Sleep Quality in a Disaster Evacuee Environment.

Nine healthy young male subjects participated in this study. Two interventions, modeling the sleep environments of evacuation shelters (evacuation shelter trial) and car seats (car trial), were compared with sleep at home (control trial). Physiological data were measured using portable two-channel electroencephalogram and electrooculogram monitoring systems, wearable heart rate sensors, and flash glucose monitors. Wake after sleep onset (WASO) and stage shift were greater in both intervention trials than the control trial, while rapid-eye movement (REM) latency and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) 1 were longer and REM duration was shorter in the evacuation shelter trial than the control trial. Glucose dynamics and power at low frequency (LF.p) of heart rate variability were higher in the car trial than in the control trial. It was confirmed that sleep environment was important to maintain sleep, and affected glucose dynamics and heart rate variability in the experimental situation.

Brain Plasticity and Neurophysiological Correlates of Meditation in Long-Term Meditators: A 18Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography Study Based on an Innovative Methodology.	DOI: 10.1089/acm.2019.0167	Objective: Previous studies evaluating neurophysiological correlates of long-term meditation are constrained by some methodological limitations. The objective of this study was to measure changes in the regional cerebral glucose metabolism during meditation using a novel methodological approach. Design: The present study was a part of a larger, nonrandomized, single-center open-label study. Setting/location: The study was conducted at the Department of Physiology and Department of Nuclear Medicine and Positron Emission Tomography. A dedicated place was set up as a yoga room, away from the positron emission tomography (PET) scanning room in the Department of Nuclear Medicine and Positron Emission Tomography, where meditators performed meditation in a peaceful environment in a sitting posture with eyes closed. The electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded to affirm the meditation objectively. Subjects: Twenty-four sets of PET scans were obtained at 2 different occasions (baseline and postmeditation within 40 min of 18FDG [18fluorodeoxyglucose] injection) from 12 apparently healthy, male, right-handed long-term meditators practicing Preksha meditation (since >5 years, at least 5 days a week) who were recruited from a well-established meditation center in Delhi. Outcome measures: Changes in the regional cerebral glucose metabolism during meditation versus baseline. Results: Regional cluster analysis showed significantly activated well-defined areas of fronto-parieto-temporal regions of the right versus left hemisphere during meditation. Interestingly, right homolog of Broca's area and right lentiform nucleus were hyperactive during meditation in all the meditators. Conclusions: Long-term meditation might potentially enhance the explicit functions of specific parts of the right hemisphere, possibly due to neuroplastic changes in the brain. Importantly, results of the current study are encouraging and show a novel methodological approach to acquire 18FDG PET/CT (computed tomography) images. The study was registered at Clinical Trial Registry India (CTRI), CTRI/2009/091/000727.

Comparison of EEG microstates with resting state fMRI and FDG-PET measures in the default mode network via simultaneously recorded trimodal (PET/MR/EEG) data.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.24429	Simultaneous trimodal positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography (PET/MRI/EEG) resting state (rs) brain data were acquired from 10 healthy male volunteers. The rs-functional MRI (fMRI) metrics, such as regional homogeneity (ReHo), degree centrality (DC) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs), as well as 2-[18F]fluoro-2-desoxy-d-glucose (FDG)-PET standardised uptake value (SUV), were calculated and the measures were extracted from the default mode network (DMN) regions of the brain. Similarly, four microstates for each subject, showing the diverse functional states of the whole brain via topographical variations due to global field power (GFP), were estimated from artefact-corrected EEG signals. In this exploratory analysis, the GFP of microstates was nonparametrically compared to rs-fMRI metrics and FDG-PET SUV measured in the DMN of the brain. The rs-fMRI metrics (ReHO, fALFF) and FDG-PET SUV did not show any significant correlations with any of the microstates. The DC metric showed a significant positive correlation with microstate C (rs  = 0.73, p = .01). FDG-PET SUVs indicate a trend for a negative correlation with microstates A, B and C. The positive correlation of microstate C with DC metrics suggests a functional relationship between cortical hubs in the frontal and occipital lobes. The results of this study suggest further exploration of this method in a larger sample and in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this exploratory pilot study is to lay the foundation for the development of such multimodal measures to be applied as biomarkers for diagnosis, disease staging, treatment response and monitoring of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Intensifying sleep slow oscillations does not improve metabolic control in healthy men.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.08.028	Impaired sleep quality and sleep loss compromise glucose homeostasis and metabolic function, but the mechanisms linking sleep and metabolic health are largely unclear. In order to gain insight into the relevance of specific electrophysiological sleep characteristics for metabolic control, we assessed the acute effect on glucose homeostasis as well as energy intake and expenditure of enhancing slow oscillatory activity, a hallmark of slow-wave sleep, by closed-loop auditory stimulation in healthy men. Twenty-two young, normal-weight men underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), indirect calorimetry and the assessment of ad-libitum breakfast intake in the morning after nocturnal sleep with or without auditory stimulation in phase with the ongoing rhythmic occurrence of slow oscillation up-states during 210 min of slow-wave sleep in the first night-half. Stimulation vs. no stimulation strongly increased slow oscillatory activity without changing overall sleep structure, but did not alter fasting or oGTT-stimulated measures of glucose homeostasis. Food intake and energy expenditure were likewise comparable between conditions. Findings indicate that in healthy humans electrophysiological sleep quality is tuned to allow for optimal metabolic control. Future studies should investigate the potential of sleep stage-specific interventions to enhance metabolic control and well-being in patients with metabolic ailments.

The Impact of Caloric and Non-Caloric Sweeteners on Food Intake and Brain Responses to Food: A Randomized Crossover Controlled Trial in Healthy Humans.	DOI: 10.3390/nu10050615	Whether non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) consumption impacts food intake behavior in humans is still unclear. Discrepant sensory and metabolic signals are proposed to mislead brain regulatory centers, in turn promoting maladaptive food choices favoring weight gain. We aimed to assess whether ingestion of sucrose- and NNS-sweetened drinks would differently alter brain responses to food viewing and food intake. Eighteen normal-weight men were studied in a fasted condition and after consumption of a standardized meal accompanied by either a NNS-sweetened (NNS), or a sucrose-sweetened (SUC) drink, or water (WAT). Their brain responses to visual food cues were assessed by means of electroencephalography (EEG) before and 45 min after meal ingestion. Four hours after meal ingestion, spontaneous food intake was monitored during an ad libitum buffet. With WAT, meal intake led to increased neural activity in the dorsal prefrontal cortex and the insula, areas linked to cognitive control and interoception. With SUC, neural activity in the insula increased as well, but decreased in temporal regions linked to food categorization, and remained unchanged in dorsal prefrontal areas. The latter modulations were associated with a significantly lower total energy intake at buffet (mean kcal ± SEM; 791 ± 62) as compared to WAT (942 ± 71) and NNS (917 ± 70). In contrast to WAT and SUC, NNS consumption did not impact activity in the insula, but led to increased neural activity in ventrolateral prefrontal regions linked to the inhibition of reward. Total energy intake at the buffet was not significantly different between WAT and NNS. Our findings highlight the differential impact of caloric and non-caloric sweeteners on subsequent brain responses to visual food cues and energy intake. These variations may reflect an initial stage of adaptation to taste-calorie uncoupling, and could be indicative of longer-term consequences of repeated NNS consumption on food intake behavior.

Neurocognitive performances of visuospatial attention and the correlations with metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers in adults with obesity.	DOI: 10.1113/EP086624	What is the central question of this study? Obesity is linked to cognitive deficits, elevated energy metabolic indices and low-grade systemic inflammation. Do the relationships between neurocognitive performance and the biochemical markers (e.g. energy metabolic indices and inflammatory cytokines) occur independently of factors known to be associated with neurocognitive dysfunction (i.e. cardiorespiratory fitness) in young adults? What is the main finding and its importance? Young obese adults showed poorer neuropsychological performances, aberrant neural activity and higher C-reactive protein and energy metabolic indices. The higher leptin and C-reactive protein concentrations showed a significant negative association with lower P3 amplitudes. However, leptin was the sole predictive factor, implicating hyperleptinaemia in the altered neurocognitive function observed in obesity. The present study was designed to explore the neurophysiological mechanism of visuospatial attention deficits in obese adults and to examine the relationships between neurocognitive (neuropsychological and neurophysiological) performances and the biochemical markers. Thirty obese adults and 30 healthy-weight control subjects, categorized by body mass index and percentage fat as measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, provided a fasting blood sample and performed a visuospatial attention protocol with concomitant electrophysiological recording. The obese group showed slower reaction times and smaller P3 amplitudes when performing the cognitive task. Even when controlling for the covariable of cardiorespiratory fitness, the results remained. In addition, the serum concentrations of insulin, glucose, leptin and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in the obese group relative to the control group, but not those of interleukin-6, interleukin-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α. Partial correlations adjusting for cardiorespiratory fitness showed that leptin and C-reactive protein concentrations in the obese group were negatively associated with poorer neurophysiological (i.e. P3 amplitude) performance. However, the regression analysis showed that leptin was the sole predictor of P3 amplitude in the obese group. These findings indicate that the individuals with obesity exhibited neurocognitive deficits when performing the visuospatial attention task, and serum leptin concentrations could be one of the influential factors.

Multimodal Fingerprints of Resting State Networks as assessed by Simultaneous Trimodal MR-PET-EEG Imaging.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-05484-w	Simultaneous MR-PET-EEG (magnetic resonance imaging - positron emission tomography - electroencephalography), a new tool for the investigation of neuronal networks in the human brain, is presented here for the first time. It enables the assessment of molecular metabolic information with high spatial and temporal resolution in a given brain simultaneously. Here, we characterize the brain's default mode network (DMN) in healthy male subjects using multimodal fingerprinting by quantifying energy metabolism via 2- [18F]fluoro-2-desoxy-D-glucose PET (FDG-PET), the inhibition - excitation balance of neuronal activation via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), its functional connectivity via fMRI and its electrophysiological signature via EEG. The trimodal approach reveals a complementary fingerprint. Neuronal activation within the DMN as assessed with fMRI is positively correlated with the mean standard uptake value of FDG. Electrical source localization of EEG signals shows a significant difference between the dorsal DMN and sensorimotor network in the frequency range of δ, θ, α and β-1, but not with β-2 and β-3. In addition to basic neuroscience questions addressing neurovascular-metabolic coupling, this new methodology lays the foundation for individual physiological and pathological fingerprints for a wide research field addressing healthy aging, gender effects, plasticity and different psychiatric and neurological diseases.

Effect of Sugar versus Mixed Breakfast on Metabolic and Neurofunctional Responses in Healthy Individuals.	DOI: 10.1155/2017/9634585	We investigated the effects of glucose and diverse breakfasts on glucose increment and ghrelin suppression and cognitive processing of sensory information assessed by frontal P300 evoked potentials. In a randomized crossover design, 12 healthy individuals (6M/6F; BMI 22.2 ± 0.4 kg/m2; 27 ± 1.3 years, mean ± SEM) underwent 50 g OGTT (A) and 3 breakfasts (B1: milk and cereals; B2: milk, apple, and chocolate cream-filled sponge cake; B3: milk, apple, bread, and hazelnut chocolate cream) to assess plasma glucose-, insulin-, and ghrelin excursions. An electroencephalography was performed before and 100 min after consumption of each load to measure the latency of frontal P300 evoked potentials as index of cognitive performance. Breakfasts B1 and B2 exhibited significantly lower glycemic and insulinemic responses as compared to A. Breakfast B3 exhibited significantly lower glycemic, but not insulinemic response, as compared to A. Final plasma ghrelin inhibition was more pronounced, albeit not significantly, in all breakfasts with respect to A. P300 latency tended to decrease following each of the three breakfasts, but B3 was the only breakfast capable to elicit a statistically significant reduction in P300 latency with respect to A (p < 0.01), suggesting ameliorated cognitive performance. Such amelioration was correlated with the 2-hour final inhibition of plasma ghrelin concentration (r = 0.61, p = 0.01).

Central Nervous Insulin Signaling in Sleep-Associated Memory Formation and Neuroendocrine Regulation.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2015.312	The neurochemical underpinnings of sleep's contribution to the establishment and maintenance of memory traces are largely unexplored. Considering that intranasal insulin administration to the CNS improves memory functions in healthy and memory-impaired humans, we tested whether brain insulin signaling and sleep interact to enhance memory consolidation in healthy participants. We investigated the effect of intranasal insulin on sleep-associated neurophysiological and neuroendocrine parameters and memory consolidation in 16 men and 16 women (aged 18-30 years), who learned a declarative word-pair task and a procedural finger sequence tapping task in the evening before intranasal insulin (160 IU) or placebo administration and 8 h of nocturnal sleep. On the subsequent evening, they learned interfering word-pairs and a new finger sequence before retrieving the original memories. Insulin increased growth hormone concentrations in the first night-half and EEG delta power during the second 90 min of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. Insulin treatment impaired the acquisition of new contents in both the declarative and procedural memory systems on the next day, whereas retrieval of original memories was unchanged. Results indicate that sleep-associated memory consolidation is not a primary mediator of insulin's acute memory-improving effect, but that the peptide acts on mechanisms that diminish the subsequent encoding of novel information. Thus, by inhibiting processes of active forgetting during sleep, central nervous insulin might reduce the interfering influence of encoding new information.

Cerebral and blood correlates of reduced functional connectivity in mild cognitive impairment.	DOI: 10.1007/s00429-014-0930-6	Growing evidence suggests that decreased functional connectivity in cortical networks precedes clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), although our knowledge about cerebral and biological correlates of this phenomenon is limited. To shed light on this issue, we have investigated whether resting-state oscillatory connectivity patterns in healthy older (HO) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) subjects are related to anatomical grey matter (GM) and functional (2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-PET) changes of neuroelectric sources of alpha rhythms, and/or to changes in plasma amyloid-beta (Aβ) and serum lipid levels, blood markers tied to AD pathogenesis and aging-related cognitive decline. We found that aMCI subjects showed decreased levels of cortical connectivity, reduced FDG-PET intake of the precuneus, and GM atrophy of the thalamus, together with higher levels of Aβ and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) compared to HO. Interestingly, levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were positively correlated with the strength of neural-phase coupling in aMCI subjects, and increased triglycerides accompanied bilateral GM loss in the precuneus of aMCI subjects. Together, these findings provide peripheral blood correlates of reduced resting-state cortical connectivity in aMCI, supported by anatomo-functional changes in cerebral sources of alpha rhythms. This framework constitutes an integrated approach to assess functional changes in cortical networks through neuroimaging and peripheral blood markers during early stages of neurodegeneration.

Default mode network hypometabolism in epileptic encephalopathies with CSWS.	DOI: 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2014.03.014	Previous studies investigating cerebral metabolic changes associated with continuous spike-waves during sleep (CSWS) compared the metabolism of children with CSWS with that of healthy adults, precluding any assessment in brain areas showing physiologic age-related metabolic changes. Here, we investigated the metabolic and connectivity changes characterizing the acute phase of CSWS activity by comparing awake brain metabolism of children with CSWS with that of pediatric pseudo-controls. Positron emission tomography using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) was performed in 17 awake children with cryptogenic CSWS (5 girls, age: 5-11 years). Voxel-based analyses identified significant metabolic changes in CSWS patients compared with 18 pediatric pseudo-controls (12 girls, age: 6-11 years, non-CSWS focal cryptogenic epilepsy with normal FDG-PET). CSWS-induced changes in the contribution of brain areas displaying metabolic changes to the level of metabolic activity in other brain areas were investigated using pathophysiological interaction. Hypermetabolism in perisylvian regions bilaterally and hypometabolism in lateral and mesial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and parahippocampal gyri characterized the acute phase of CSWS (p<0.05 FWE). No change in thalamic metabolism was disclosed. Altered functional connectivity was found between hyper- and hypometabolic regions in CSWS patients compared with pediatric pseudo-controls. This study demonstrates hypometabolism in key nodes of the default mode network (DMN) in awake patients with CSWS, in relation with a possible phenomenon of sustained remote inhibition from the epileptic foci. This hypometabolism might account for some of the acquired cognitive or behavioral features of CSWS epileptic encephalopathies. This study failed to find any evidence of thalamic metabolic changes, which supports the primary involvement of the cortex in CSWS genesis.

Selective slow wave sleep but not rapid eye movement sleep suppression impairs morning glucose tolerance in healthy men.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.03.018	Shortened nocturnal sleep impairs morning glucose tolerance. The underlying mechanism of this effect is supposed to involve a reduced fraction of slow wave sleep (SWS). However, it remains unanswered if impaired glucose tolerance occurs due to specific SWS reduction or a general disturbance of sleep. Sixteen healthy men participated in three experimental conditions in a crossover design: SWS suppression, rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep disturbance, and regular sleep. Selective sleep stage disturbance was performed by means of an acoustic tone (532Hz) with gradually rising sound intensity. Blood concentrations of glucoregulatory parameters were measured upon an oral glucose tolerance test the next morning. Our data show that morning plasma glucose and serum insulin responses were significantly increased after selective SWS suppression. Moreover, SWS suppression reduced postprandial insulin sensitivity up to 20%, as determined by Matsuda Index. Contrastingly, disturbed REM-sleep did not affect glucose homeostasis. We conclude that specifically SWS reduction is critically involved in the impairment of glucose tolerance associated with disturbed sleep. Therefore, glucose metabolism in subjects predisposed to reduced SWS (e.g. depression, aging, obstructive sleep apnea, pharmacological treatment) should be thoroughly monitored.

Effects of daytime food intake on memory consolidation during sleep or sleep deprivation.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0040298	Sleep enhances memory consolidation. Bearing in mind that food intake produces many metabolic signals that can influence memory processing in humans (e.g., insulin), the present study addressed the question as to whether the enhancing effect of sleep on memory consolidation is affected by the amount of energy consumed during the preceding daytime. Compared to sleep, nocturnal wakefulness has been shown to impair memory consolidation in humans. Thus, a second question was to examine whether the impaired memory consolidation associated with sleep deprivation (SD) could be compensated by increased daytime energy consumption. To these aims, 14 healthy normal-weight men learned a finger tapping sequence (procedural memory) and a list of semantically associated word pairs (declarative memory). After the learning period, standardized meals were administered, equaling either ∼50% or ∼150% of the estimated daily energy expenditure. In the morning, after sleep or wakefulness, memory consolidation was tested. Plasma glucose was measured both before learning and retrieval. Polysomnographic sleep recordings were performed by electroencephalography (EEG). Independent of energy intake, subjects recalled significantly more word pairs after sleep than they did after SD. When subjects stayed awake and received an energy oversupply, the number of correctly recalled finger sequences was equal to those seen after sleep. Plasma glucose did not differ among conditions, and sleep time in the sleep conditions was not influenced by the energy intake interventions. These data indicate that the daytime energy intake level affects neither sleep's capacity to boost the consolidation of declarative and procedural memories, nor sleep's quality. However, high energy intake was followed by an improved procedural but not declarative memory consolidation under conditions of SD. This suggests that the formation of procedural memory is not only triggered by sleep but is also sensitive to the fluctuations in the energy state of the body.

Effects of intensified metabolic control on CNS function in type 2 diabetes.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.06.009	The mild cognitive decline associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has been suggested to be reversible with improved glycemic control. In order to characterise this cognitive decline and study the effects of improved glycemic control we have studied patients with T2DM (N=28) and healthy control subjects (N=21). One group of patients with diabetes (N=15) were given a 2-month treatment of intensified glycemic control, whereas the other group (N=13) maintained their regular treatment. Cognitive function in four different domains, auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and resting EEG power spectrum were studied in the two groups of patients and in healthy control subjects before and after the 2-month trial period. There were significant differences at baseline (p<0.02) between patients with T2DM and controls. Patients had lower scores in two cognitive domains: verbal fluency (p<0.01) and visuospatial ability (p<0.03). T2DM also affected ERP with a decrease in N100 amplitude (p<0.04) and an increase in P300 latency (p<0.03). Furthermore, resting EEG activity in the beta band (13-30Hz) was reduced (p<0.04). The change between 1st and 2nd investigation was significantly different in the three groups of patients/subjects (p<0.03). Patients receiving intensified treatment for glycemic control had an improvement of cognitive ability in visuospatial ability (p<0.02) and semantic memory performance (p<0.04) together with increased resting EEG activity in the alpha band (8-13Hz, p<0.02) and connectivity in the theta (4-8Hz, p<0.03) and alpha bands (p<0.03) over central and lateral regions. Furthermore, there was an increase in the connectivity in the beta band (p<0.04) over the central regions of the scalp. In conclusion, subjects with T2DM had a similar type of cognitive function impairment and EEG/ERP abnormality as previously demonstrated for subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Intensified therapy showed cognitive improvement not shown for regular treatment, suggesting that the negative effect of T2DM on cognition is reversible by means of improved glycemic control. Furthermore, there was an improvement in electro-physiological measures, suggesting increased availability of compensatory mechanisms in subjects with intensified treatment.

Electroencephalographic response to procedural pain in healthy term newborn infants.	DOI: 10.1203/PDR.0b013e3181825487	The current study aimed to characterize changes in EEG-related measures after noxious stimuli in neonates and to assess their potential utility as measures of pain and/or discomfort during neonatal intensive care. Seventy-two healthy term infants were investigated: Twenty-eight had a non-skin-breaking pin-prick on the heel, randomized to receive either oral glucose (n = 16) or water (n = 12) before the stimulus. Twenty-one infants were studied during a venous blood sample from the dorsum of the hand, 23 infants during a capillary heel stick. Behavioral pain responses were assessed with the Premature Infant Pain Profile Scale. The stimulus evoked a significant increase in higher frequency components (10-30 Hz) which also correlated to behavioral measures. The frontotemporal localization of the increased activity with frequency bands similar to electromuscular artifacts and the relation to behavioral measures confirmed that this activity corresponds to an increase in muscle tone. There was no change in frontal EEG asymmetry in any of the groups. The present results indicate that responses in cortical activity recorded by EEG are not useful for clinical assessment of infants' responses to noxious stimuli.

Slow-wave sleep and the risk of type 2 diabetes in humans.	DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0706446105	"There is convincing evidence that, in humans, discrete sleep stages are important for daytime brain function, but whether any particular sleep stage has functional significance for the rest of the body is not known. Deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS), is thought to be the most ""restorative"" sleep stage, but beneficial effects of SWS for physical well being have not been demonstrated. The initiation of SWS coincides with hormonal changes that affect glucose regulation, suggesting that SWS may be important for normal glucose tolerance. If this were so, selective suppression of SWS should adversely affect glucose homeostasis and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Here we show that, in young healthy adults, all-night selective suppression of SWS, without any change in total sleep time, results in marked decreases in insulin sensitivity without adequate compensatory increase in insulin release, leading to reduced glucose tolerance and increased diabetes risk. SWS suppression reduced delta spectral power, the dominant EEG frequency range in SWS, and left other EEG frequency bands unchanged. Importantly, the magnitude of the decrease in insulin sensitivity was strongly correlated with the magnitude of the reduction in SWS. These findings demonstrate a clear role for SWS in the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, our data suggest that reduced sleep quality with low levels of SWS, as occurs in aging and in many obese individuals, may contribute to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes."

The effects of combined caffeine and glucose drinks on attention in the human brain.	DOI: 10.1080/10284150500096994	The objective of this research was to measure the effects of energising drinks containing caffeine and glucose, upon mental activity during sustained selective attention. Non-invasive electrophysiological brain recordings were made during a behavioural study of selective attention in which participants received either energising or placebo drinks. We tested specifically whether energising drinks have significant effects upon behavioural measures of performance during a task requiring sustained visual selective attention, as well as on accompanying components of the event-related potential (ERPs) related to information processing in the brain. Forty healthy volunteers were blindly assigned to receive either the energising drink or a similar-tasting placebo drink. The behavioural task involved identifying predefined target stimulus among rapidly presented streams of peripheral visual stimuli, and making speeded motor responses to this stimulus. During task performance, accuracy, reaction times and ongoing brain activity were stored for analysis. The energising drink enhanced behavioural performance both in terms of accuracy and speed of reactions. The energising drink also had significant effects upon the event-related potentials. Effects started from the enhancement of the earliest components (Cl/P1), reflecting early visual cortical processing in the energising-drink group relative to the placebo group over the contralateral scalp. The later N1, N2 and P3 components related to decision-making and responses were also modulated by the energising drink. Energising drinks containing caffeine and glucose can enhance behavioural performance during demanding tasks requiring selective attention. The behavioural benefits are coupled to direct effects upon neural information processing.

Effects of a carbohydrate supplement upon resting brain activity.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02734278	Glucose is a major energy source for the brain, and along with several monosaccharide derivatives as components of brain gangliosides, they play important roles in neurologic function. However, there is little information available on the role of glucose and other monosaccharides on resting brain activity. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a single dose of a carbohydrate supplement containing glucose and several of its derivatives on resting brain activity in 20 healthy male college students. The supplement provided an insignificant amount of carbohydrate (3.9 g), protein (0.28 g), fat (0 g), and calories (14 kcal). The amount of glucose in the supplement was 0.5 g (1% the amount of glucose used in adult studies of cognitive functioning and memory). We hypothesized that the glyconutrient supplement would enhance brain activity associated with alertness and attention. The study design was double blind, with subjects randomly assigned to one of two orders, either carbohydrate supplement week one followed by placebo a week later, or the opposite. Electrical brain activity was monitored by 15 electrodes positioned at nine standard international 10-20 system locations, including three bilateral pairs at frontal, parietal, and occipital sites. Thirty minutes following ingestion of a placebo or carbohydrate supplement drink, EEG activity was recorded for 10-mins while subjects focused on a stationary visual target. Spectral power of resting brain activity was computed and analyzed contrasting the placebo and supplement groups. Relative to placebo, the carbohydrate supplement significantly enhanced power in three brain wave frequencies (theta, alpha, and beta) that are known to be associated with attention and arousal. Since changes were observed in the supplement but not placebo group, our study suggests that additional sugars in the glyconutritional supplement facilitate enhancement of brain electrical activity. Whether the apparent enhancement of arousal in baseline recordings is associated with improved task performance remains to be determined.

Increased activation of anterior paralimbic and executive cortex from waking to rapid eye movement sleep in depression.	DOI: 10.1001/archpsyc.61.7.695	Depression is associated with sleep disturbances, including alterations in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, that may relate to the neurobiology of the disorder. Given that REM sleep activates limbic and anterior paralimbic cortex and that depressed patients demonstrate increases in electroencephalographic sleep measures of REM, we hypothesized greater activation of these structures during waking to REM sleep in depressed patients.

Human regional cerebral glucose metabolism during non-rapid eye movement sleep in relation to waking.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awf103	Sleep is an essential human function. Although the function of sleep has generally been regarded to be restorative, recent data indicate that it also plays an important role in cognition. The neurobiology of human sleep is most effectively analysed with functional imaging, and PET studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In this study, PET was used to determine patterns of regional glucose metabolism in NREM sleep compared with waking. We hypothesized that brain structures related to waking cognitive function would show a persistence of function into the NREM sleep state. Fourteen healthy subjects (age range 21-49 years; 10 women, 4 men) underwent concurrent EEG sleep studies and [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET scans during waking and NREM sleep. Whole-brain glucose metabolism declined significantly from waking to NREM sleep. Relative decreases in regional metabolism from waking to NREM sleep occurred in wide areas of frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital association cortex, primary visual cortex, and in anterior/dorsomedial thalamus. After controlling for the whole-brain declines in absolute metabolism, relative increases in regional metabolism from waking to NREM were found bilaterally in the dorsal pontine tegmentum, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, ventral striatum, anterior cingulate cortex and extensive regions of the mesial temporal lobe, including the amygdala and hippocampus, and in the right dorsal parietal association cortex and primary somatosensory and motor cortices. The reductions in relative metabolism in NREM sleep compared with waking are consistent with prior findings from blood flow studies. The relative increases in glucose utilization in the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, ventral striatum, amygdala, hippocampus and pontine reticular formation are new observations that are in accordance with the view that NREM sleep is important to brain plasticity in homeostatic regulation and mnemonic processing.

Efficacy of a 'functional energy drink' in counteracting driver sleepiness.	DOI: 10.1016/s0031-9384(01)00669-2	"Driver sleepiness is a major cause of serious road crashes. Coffee is often used as an effective countermeasure to driver sleepiness. However, the caffeine levels in coffee are variable, whereas certain proprietary ""functional energy drinks"" (FEDs) contain known levels of caffeine (and other ingredients). We investigated the effectiveness of a well-known FED in reducing sleepiness in drivers. Twelve healthy young adults drove an instrumented car simulator between 14:00 and 17:00 h. Their sleepiness was enhanced by sleep restriction to 5 h the night before. Following a pretreatment 30-min drive and at the beginning of a 30-min break, participants were given double-blind 250-ml FED (containing sucrose, glucose, 80-mg caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone and vitamins) vs. a control drink with the same volume and same taste but without caffeine, taurine and glucuronolactone. Two hours of continuous driving ensued. Lane drifting, subjective sleepiness and the electroencephalogram (EEG) were monitored throughout. Compared with the control, the FED significantly reduced sleep-related driving incidents and subjective sleepiness for the first 90 min of the drive. There was a trend for the EEG to reflect less sleepiness during this period. It was concluded that the FED is beneficial in reducing sleepiness and sleep-related driving incidents under conditions of afternoon monotonous driving following sleep restriction the night before."

Insular cortex involvement in mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy: a positron emission tomography study.	DOI: 10.1002/ana.10087	Somesthetic and emotional symptoms that are common in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy are usually related to hippocampo-amygdalar complex involvement. Recent stereo-electroencephalographic studies have shown a relationship between such symptoms and epileptic insular discharges. To further investigate this problem, we carried out a positron emission tomography study using fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) and flumazenil (11C-FMZ) in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients. The aim of our study was to assess the existence of a cortical insular involvement in order to examine its clinical correlates and the relationship between the postoperative outcome and the insular involvement. Fluorodeoxyglucose and flumazenil-positron emission tomography studies were carried out in 18 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients. A statistical parametric mapping (SPM96) was performed to analyze the data in comparison to 18 healthy volunteers. For each set of fluorodeoxyglucose and flumazenil images a group and an individual analysis were performed. In addition, a region of interest analysis was performed to validate the results. Focusing on the metabolic abnormalities, we also investigated the role of insular cortex in the symptoms experienced by the patients and the prognostic value of insular metabolic abnormalities. Highly significant hypometabolism and BZR binding decreases were detected in the insular cortex. Results were similar using the region of interest approach. Insular involvement (mainly ipsilateral to the seizure focus) was present in 60% of the patients. Emotional symptoms correlated with hypometabolism in the anterior part of the ipsilateral insular cortex, whereas somesthetic symptoms correlated with hypometabolism in the posterior part. No relationship between postoperative outcome and ipsilateral insular hypometabolism was found. Unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with insular hypometabolism and benzodiazepine receptor loss. Our results also suggest that the anterior part of the insular cortex is involved in the emotional symptoms and the posterior insular cortex is involved in the somesthetic symptoms. Hypometabolism located in the insula did not influence postoperative outcome after anterior lobectomy.

Glucose and glucoregulatory modulation of memory scanning, event-related potentials and EEG in elderly subjects.	DOI: 10.1159/000054936	Endogenous P300b event-related potential (ERP) and behavioral performance measures, extracted during a visual memory scanning task, and spectral indices of resting electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, were assessed in 12 healthy elderly adults before and after double-blind oral administration of a placebo or glucose (50 mg) beverage. Glucoregulation was estimated by deriving a recovery index to categorize subjects as having better (BR) or poorer (PR) blood glucose recovery. Although glucoregulatory status did not impact on EEG or task performance, PR subjects exhibited reduced P300b areas relative to BR subjects prior to beverage administration. Glucose did not alter P300b or memory scanning performance but, regardless of glucoregulatory status, it increased the EEG power in the slow alpha frequency band. The study results suggest that peripheral glucoregulation can influence neuroelectric measures of cognition and that the acute ingestion of glucose can modulate central arousal processes.

Towards a neurobiology of dysfunctional arousal in depression: the relationship between beta EEG power and regional cerebral glucose metabolism during NREM sleep.	DOI: 10.1016/s0925-4927(00)00045-7	This study sought to clarify the neurobiological basis of variations in one aspect of central nervous system 'arousal' in depression by characterizing the functional neuroanatomic correlates of beta electroencephalographic (EEG) power density during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. First, nine healthy (n=9) subjects underwent concurrent EEG sleep studies and [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans during their first NREM period of sleep in order to generate hypotheses about specific brain structures that show a relationship between increased beta power and increased relative glucose metabolism. Second, brain structures identified in the healthy subjects were then used as a priori regions of interest in similar analyses from identical studies in 12 depressed subjects. Statistical parametric mapping was used to identify the relationship between beta power and relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRglu) during NREM sleep. Regions that demonstrated significant correlations between beta power and relative cerebral glucose metabolism in both the healthy and depressed subjects included the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the right lateral inferior occipital cortex. During a baseline night of sleep, depressed patients demonstrated a trend toward greater beta power in relation to a separate age- and gender-matched healthy control group. In both healthy and depressed subjects, beta power negatively correlated with subjective sleep quality. Finally, in the depressed group, there was a trend for beta power to correlate with an indirect measure of absolute whole brain metabolism during NREM sleep. This study demonstrates a similar relationship between electrophysiological arousal and glucose metabolism in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in depressed and healthy subjects. Given the increased electrophysiological arousal in some depressed patients and the known anatomical relations between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and brain activating structures, this study raises the possibility that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a significant role in mediating one aspect of dysfunctional arousal found in more severely aroused depressed patients.

Adrenocorticotropin-related modulation of the human EEG and individual variability.	DOI: 10.1016/s0304-3940(99)00078-6	During a 6-h period in resting conditions, the blood concentrations at rest of cortisol, glucose and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) varied spontaneously within physiological ranges in eight healthy male volunteers (24.5+/-1.7 years), without pulsatile changes, correlation among variables, or indications of stress response. The power of the 6.5-14.0 Hz physiological 'alpha' rhythm of the electroencephalogram (EEG) proved inverted-U correlated with the ACTH concentration (with maximum power at 12-14 pmol/l ACTH) but was independent from the extent of ACTH change or from cortisol/glucose concentrations. Two subgroups of subjects with low/high EEG power values could be separated depending on ACTH concentration, with estimated cut-off at 7-8 pmol/l. A direct ACTH modulation of brain electrophysiology or common factors (e.g. the corticotropin-releasing hormone) pacing both ACTH and EEG are suggested and may account for individual EEG differences.

Temporal lobe epilepsy: correlation of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.	DOI: 10.1002/mrm.1910370105	Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has demonstrated reduction of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the epileptogenic temporal lobe. However, the correlation of NAA reduction with cerebral metabolic abnormalities is unknown in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Proton MRS and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG/PET) were used to study 12 unilateral TLE patients with medically intractable seizures and 26 age-matched healthy volunteers. The epileptogenic temporal lobe of each patient was determined by both electroencephalography and FDG/PET. The NAA/choline-plus-creatine (NAA/(Cho+Cr)) ratio correlated significantly with the interictal glucose metabolism (r = 0.54, P < 0.01) in 12 TLE patients. The mean NAA/(Cho+Cr) ratio in the epileptogenic temporal lobe was significantly less than that in the contralateral side (P < 0.01), and less than that in normal control temporal lobes (P < 0.0001). These results suggest that quantitative MRS abnormalities reflect underlying metabolic pathology in TLE.

Topography of interictal glucose hypometabolism in unilateral mesiotemporal epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1212/wnl.46.5.1422	We mapped the regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRGlu) in 20 patients suffering from medically refractory focal epilepsy of either left or right mesiotemporal origin (mTLE) during resting wakefulness. After temporal lobectomy, histology demonstrated hippocampal sclerosis in 18 patients. Pixel-by-pixel comparisons with healthy control subjects showed significant (p < 0.001) depressions of the mean rCMRGlu ipsilateral to the epileptic focus in the mesiotemporal region, including the hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus. Additional remote rCMRGlu depressions occurred bilaterally in the fronto-orbital cortex and ipsilaterally in the posterior insula and the thalamus. Patients with left-sided mTLE had additional rCMRGlu depressions in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's region) and superior temporal gyrus at the parietotemporal junction, whereas corresponding rCMRGlu depressions were not present in patients with right mTLE. Neuropsychological testing showed impaired verbal fluency, verbal intelligence, and verbal memory in the left mTLE patients. Correlations of the specific mean rCMRGlu depressions and the neuropsychological deficits suggest that impaired language functions in patients with left mTLE could result from functional changes beyond the temporal lobe.

Monitoring set-up for selection of parameters for detection of hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02637024	Recurrent severe hypoglycaemia is often an unsolved problem in diabetic patients under intensified insulin treatment. As no reliable long-term stable blood glucose sensor has yet been developed, registration of other body function changes could help to detect severe hypoglycaemia. A measuring system is described, capable on the one hand of recording EEG, heart rate, peripheral pulse, skin temperature, respiratory movements, skin impedance and arterial blood pressure, and capable of registering plasma glucose, counter-regulatory hormones, symptoms and cognitive performance under experimental conditions during hypoglycaemia, on the other. In a clinical study involving both insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in healthy subjects and insulin-dependent diabetic patients, the practical value and the character of changes of the recorded parameters are investigated. Currently insensitivity to hypoglycaemia, impracticability, complexity or susceptibility to artefacts make use of most parameters unsuitable for hypoglycaemia prevention. It is believed, however, that future efforts could result in indirect registration of hypoglycaemia, including a qualified combination of different parameters, individual adaptation in accordance with particular responses of individual patients, together with new measuring and sensor techniques.

Quantitative topographical EEG compared to FDG PET for classification of vascular and degenerative dementia.	DOI: 10.1016/0013-4694(94)90034-5	Quantitative topographical EEG was compared with regional glucose metabolism measured by PET with respect to the sensitivity in the classification of mild to moderate dementia. In 24 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (DAT), 19 patients with vascular dementia (VD) and 15 age-matched healthy controls, global and regional EEG and PET data were analyzed. The metabolic ratio between typically affected and non-affected regions differentiated between DAT and VD (P < 0.001) as well as between DAT and normal controls (P < 0.001) even for the subgroup of mild dementia. In contrast to PET, global EEG changes were more sensitive than regional alterations for the classification into the respective groups. Relative theta power was most sensitive for the differentiation of demented patients irrespective of type of normal controls (P < 0.01), whereas OCC/FR alpha ratio (occipital divided by frontal power) separated between dementia types (P < 0.01) as well as between DAT and normals (P < 0.05). Additionally, EEG may help to grade severity especially in DAT. Combined use of EEG and PET was more discriminative and reached higher diagnostic specificity than each test individually. These results suggest that EEG and PET are complementary diagnostic procedures for the differentiation and classification of dementias.

Differences between lateral and mesial temporal metabolism interictally in epilepsy of mesial temporal origin.	DOI: 10.1212/wnl.40.9.1420	We performed interictal [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in 17 patients with well-defined unilateral anterior mesial temporal epileptogenic foci as determined by EEG procedures. Sixteen of these patients subsequently underwent surgical resection of the epileptogenic focus. We measured local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in mesial and lateral temporal structures and compared them with metabolic rates for analogous regions in 16 healthy normal volunteers and the contralateral hemisphere of the epileptic patients. We found relative hypometabolism ipsilateral to the seizure focus more frequently and to a greater degree in the lateral than in the mesial temporal cortex. Since the physiologic abnormalities involved mesial temporal structures, this observation suggests that functional pathways exist between mesial and lateral temporal cortex normally and that these pathways are altered in epilepsy of mesial temporal origin. Hypometabolism did not correlate well with histologic abnormalities in the surgical specimens.

Neurophysiological changes during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and in the recovery period following glucose infusion in type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and in normal man.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00403327	Hypoglycaemia (median venous blood glucose 1.8 mmol/l; range 1.6-2.3) was induced by an intravenous infusion of regular insulin in eight patients with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (age 28.0 +/- 7.4 years; mean +/- SD, duration 15.5 +/- 5.1 years) and in 12 age-matched healthy male control subjects. Multi-channel frequency analysis of electroencephalogram (electrophysiologic brain mapping) and recording of P300 and somatosensory evoked potentials were performed before, during and immediately after the hypoglycaemic period. The hypoglycaemia produced a significant increase in low frequency electroencephalographic activity in both groups, most pronounced over anterior regions of the brain. The electroencephalographic activity was normalised immediately after the hypoglycaemic period. The patients with diabetes showed somewhat longer P300 latencies during the initial normoglycaemic examination. Hypoglycaemia caused a marked reduction of the P300 amplitude in both groups of subjects and the amplitude was not restored immediately after normalisation of blood glucose levels. The somatosensory cortical responses were not affected by hypoglycaemia. We conclude that hypoglycaemia results in impairment in cerebral function, as measured by neurophysiological techniques, which is not immediately normalised when blood glucose is restored to normal.

Four of the older patients with DS had a history of mental deterioration, disorientation, and memory loss and were demented. Patients and control subjects had EEGs, psychometric testing, quantitative computed tomography, and positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18. A ""blinded"" reader classified the EEGs into two groups--those with normal alpha background or those with abnormal background. All the control subjects, the 13 young adult patients with DS, and the 5 older patients with DS had normal EEG backgrounds. In comparison with the age-matched patients with DS with normal alpha background, older patients with DS with decreased alpha background had dementia, fewer visuospatial skills, decreased attention span, larger third ventricles, and a global decrease in cerebral glucose utilization with parietal hypometabolism. In the young patients with DS, the EEG background did not correlate with psychometric or positron emission tomographic findings, but the third ventricles were significantly larger in those with abnormal EEG background. The young patients with DS, with or without normal EEG background, had positron emission tomographic findings similar to those of the control subjects. The mechanism underlying the abnormal EEG background may be the neuropathologic changes of Alzheimer's disease in older patients with DS and may be cerebral immaturity in younger patients with DS."

Readiness potential in different states of physical activation and after ingestion of taurine and/or caffeine containing drinks.	DOI: 10.1007/s007260170066	"To investigate the influence of taurine and caffeine containing drinks and physical stress on the cortical movement-preparation, the readiness potentials or ""Bereitschaftspotentiale"" (BPs), preceding voluntary self-placed pedalling movements, were examined after different states of exhaustion on an ergometer. 15 (13 right-handed) healthy men, aged between 22-30, participated in a randomised, cross over, double-blind, placebo controlled study. BPs were averaged out of artefact free EEG-segments from more than 90 triggered events, measured at 17 electrodes of the 10:20 system. With increasing effort the BPs were enlarged differently depending on the drink consumed. In placebo trials after exhaustive exercise premovement negative potential curves could be seen even in frontal areas. With caffeine the BPs increased after lower workload, achieving a level, which was reached in the placebo trials only after submaximal physical activation. Furthermore a significant shortening of premovement-brain-potentials in frontal and parietal regions could be seen in the caffeine trials at rest. Taurine admixture seems to inhibit this effects."

Basmisanil, a highly selective GABAA-α5 negative allosteric modulator: preclinical pharmacology and demonstration of functional target engagement in man.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-021-87307-7	GABAA-α5 subunit-containing receptors have been shown to play a key modulatory role in cognition and represent a promising drug target for cognitive dysfunction, as well as other disorders. Here we report on the preclinical and early clinical profile of a novel GABAA-α5 selective negative allosteric modulator (NAM), basmisanil, which progressed into Phase II trials for intellectual disability in Down syndrome and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Preclinical pharmacology studies showed that basmisanil is the most selective GABAA-α5 receptor NAM described so far. Basmisanil bound to recombinant human GABAA-α5 receptors with 5 nM affinity and more than 90-fold selectivity versus α1, α2, and α3 subunit-containing receptors. Moreover, basmisanil inhibited GABA-induced currents at GABAA-α5 yet had little or no effect at the other receptor subtypes. An in vivo occupancy study in rats showed dose-dependent target engagement and was utilized to establish the plasma exposure to receptor occupancy relationship. At estimated receptor occupancies between 30 and 65% basmisanil attenuated diazepam-induced spatial learning impairment in rats (Morris water maze), improved executive function in non-human primates (object retrieval), without showing anxiogenic or proconvulsant effects in rats. During the Phase I open-label studies, basmisanil showed good safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers at maximum GABAA-α5 receptor occupancy as confirmed by PET analysis with the tracer [11C]-Ro 15-4513. An exploratory EEG study provided evidence for functional activity of basmisanil in human brain. Therefore, these preclinical and early clinical studies show that basmisanil has an ideal profile to investigate potential clinical benefits of GABAA-α5 receptor negative modulation.

Hyperventilation-induced EEG changes in humans and their modulation by an anticonvulsant drug.	DOI: 10.1016/0920-1211(90)90100-a	Surface-negative DC shifts, arising from depolarization of apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells, represent excitability of cortical neuronal networks. Hyperventilation, used in epilepsy diagnosis to provoke epileptiform discharges, is thought to increase excitability of neuronal tissue; correspondingly, hyperventilation produces negative DC shifts. Extreme negative DC shifts, accompanying epileptiform EEG patterns, have been observed in epileptic patients during hyperventilation. Anticonvulsants, supposed to dampen cortical excitability, should inhibit the development of overexcitability and, hence, also of pronounced negative DC shifts. The present study examined DC shifts induced by hyperventilation in healthy human subjects under the influence of the benzodiazepine, clonazepam, which is used as anticonvulsant. In a double-blind setting, 36 male student volunteers received 4.5 mg clonazepam or the equivalent amount of placebo. DC-EEG and respiration rate were measured during 3 periods each of 3 min: baseline, hyperventilation, and recovery. Compared to baseline, hyperventilation produced a negative DC shift of an average 36 +/- 8 microV under placebo conditions. Clonazepam reduced the hyperventilation-induced negativity to 13 +/- 5 microV. Negativity suppression became weakened with increasing blood plasma levels of the drug. Respiration depth and frequency, increasing under hyperventilation, did not differ among the groups. Clonazepam treatment gave rise to beta-waves and prevented the increase in alpha and theta activity that was found in placebo subjects during the recording period; this was only true, however, for low to moderate plasma concentrations of clonazepam. Results are consistent with the notion that a hyperventilation-induced increase in neuronal excitability can be measured by cortical DC shifts. The reduction of negative shifts under anticonvulsants might indicate dampening of cortical neuronal excitability which is intended by antiepileptic drugs.

Untangling TMS-EEG responses caused by TMS versus sensory input using optimized sham control and GABAergic challenge.	DOI: 10.1113/JP283986	The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) elegantly probes the excitability and connectivity of the human brain. However, TMS-EEG signals inevitably also contain sensory-evoked responses caused by TMS-associated auditory and somatosensory inputs, constituting a substantial confounding factor. Here we applied our recently established optimized SHAM protocol (Gordon et al., Neuroimage 2021:118708) to disentangle TMS-EEG responses caused by TMS vs. sensory input. One unresolved question is whether these responses superimpose without relevant interaction, a requirement for their disaggregation by the optimized SHAM approach. We applied in 20 healthy subjects a pharmacological intervention using a single oral dose of 20 mg of diazepam, a positive modulator of GABAA receptors. Diazepam decreased the amplitudes of the P60 and P150 components specifically in the ACTIVE TMS and/or the ACTIVE TMS minus SHAM conditions but not in the SHAM condition, pointing to a response caused by TMS. In contrast, diazepam suppressed the amplitude of the N100 component indiscriminately in the ACTIVE TMS and SHAM conditions but not in the ACTIVE TMS minus SHAM condition, pointing to a response caused by sensory input. Moreover, diazepam suppressed the beta-band response observed in the motor cortex specifically after ACTIVE TMS and ACTIVE TMS minus SHAM. These findings demonstrate a lack of interaction of TMS-EEG responses caused by TMS vs. sensory input and validate optimized SHAM-controlled TMS-EEG as an appropriate approach to untangle these TMS-EEG responses. This knowledge will enable the proficient use of TMS-EEG to probe the physiology of the human cortex. KEY POINTS: Optimized SHAM disentangles TMS-EEG responses caused by TMS vs. sensory input. Diazepam differentially modulates TMS-EEG responses caused by TMS vs. sensory input. Diazepam modulation of P60 and P150 indicate TMS-EEG responses caused by TMS. Diazepam modulation of N100 indicate a TMS-EEG response caused by sensory input.

The Possible Role of Endozepines in Sleep Regulation and Biomarker of Process S of the Borbély Sleep Model.	DOI: 10.1080/07420528.2020.1849252	The well-known Two-Process Model of Sleep Regulation describes the integration of the circadian rhythm of arousal and sleep - Process C, and the homeostatic pressure to sleep - Process S. Presently, the known biological markers for Process C are melatonin and core body temperature; whereas, for Process S, there is no biological marker except that of aspects of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Endozepines are a class of endogenous compounds that act like benzodiazepines (BZ), i.e., serving as ligands for the BZ binding sites on GABAA receptors. Not much is known about the role of endozepines, in particular non-peptide endozepines, in the sleep field except very few reports about high concentrations observed in endozepine stupor, a rare phenomenon of idiopathic recurring stupor. We focused on hypoxanthine and thromboxane A2, which are considered to have endozepine function. This study aimed to examine the effect of 24 h of acute sleep deprivation on blood levels of hypoxanthine and thromboxane A2 of healthy subjects without sleep problems or disorders. The results showed a significant decrease of both compounds in the morning after sleep deprivation in comparison to the unrestricted normal sleep condition, thereby suggesting that these endozepines are secreted regularly while asleep, and, thus, are necessary for the sleep process. This study is the first to suggest a connection between specific biological markers - endozepines and Process S - in the Two-Process Model of Sleep Regulation and, furthermore, it sheds light on the possible role of endozepines in sleepiness and fatigue.

Altered transient brain dynamics in multiple sclerosis: Treatment or pathology?	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.24737	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating, neuroinflammatory, and -degenerative disease that affects the brain's neurophysiological functioning through brain atrophy, a reduced conduction velocity and decreased connectivity. Currently, little is known on how MS affects the fast temporal dynamics of activation and deactivation of the different large-scale, ongoing brain networks. In this study, we investigated whether these temporal dynamics are affected in MS patients and whether these changes are induced by the pathology or by the use of benzodiazepines (BZDs), an important symptomatic treatment that aims at reducing insomnia, spasticity and anxiety and reinforces the inhibitory effect of GABA. To this aim, we employed a novel method capable of detecting these fast dynamics in 90 MS patients and 46 healthy controls. We demonstrated a less dynamic frontal default mode network in male MS patients and a reduced activation of the same network in female MS patients, regardless of BZD usage. Additionally, BZDs strongly altered the brain's dynamics by increasing the time spent in the deactivating sensorimotor network and the activating occipital network. Furthermore, BZDs induced a decreased power in the theta band and an increased power in the beta band. The latter was strongly expressed in those states without activation of the sensorimotor network. In summary, we demonstrate gender-dependent changes to the brain dynamics in the frontal DMN and strong effects from BZDs. This study is the first to characterise the effect of multiple sclerosis and BZDs in vivo in a spatially, temporally and spectrally defined way.

Spatio-temporal dynamics of multimodal EEG-fNIRS signals in the loss and recovery of consciousness under sedation using midazolam and propofol.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0187743	On sedation motivated by the clinical needs for safety and reliability, recent studies have attempted to identify brain-specific signatures for tracking patient transition into and out of consciousness, but the differences in neurophysiological effects between 1) the sedative types and 2) the presence/absence of surgical stimulations still remain unclear. Here we used multimodal electroencephalography-functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS) measurements to observe electrical and hemodynamic responses during sedation simultaneously. Forty healthy volunteers were instructed to push the button to administer sedatives in response to auditory stimuli every 9-11 s. To generally illustrate brain activity at repetitive transition points at the loss of consciousness (LOC) and the recovery of consciousness (ROC), patient-controlled sedation was performed using two different sedatives (midazolam (MDZ) and propofol (PPF)) under two surgical conditions. Once consciousness was lost via sedatives, we observed gradually increasing EEG power at lower frequencies (<15 Hz) and decreasing power at higher frequencies (>15 Hz), as well as spatially increased EEG powers in the delta and lower alpha bands, and particularly also in the upper alpha rhythm, at the frontal and parieto-occipital areas over time. During ROC from unconsciousness, these spatio-temporal changes were reversed. Interestingly, the level of consciousness was switched on/off at significantly higher effect-site concentrations of sedatives in the brain according to the use of surgical stimuli, but the spatio-temporal EEG patterns were similar, regardless of the sedative used. We also observed sudden phase shifts in fronto-parietal connectivity at the LOC and the ROC as critical points. fNIRS measurement also revealed mild hemodynamic fluctuations. Compared with general anesthesia, our results provide insights into critical hallmarks of sedative-induced (un)consciousness, which have similar spatio-temporal EEG-fNIRS patterns regardless of the stage and the sedative used.

Advanced Analysis of Pharmaco-EEG Data in Humans.	DOI: 10.1159/000431096	Pharmaco-electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method used to assess the effects of pharmacological compounds on the central nervous system by processing the EEG signals which directly reveal the spontaneous synchronised postsynaptic neuronal activity of the cortex with high temporal resolution. The International Pharmaco-Encephalography Society (IPEG) has recently published guidelines, which were produced by a global panel of EEG experts, with the goal to increase the standardisation of pharmaco-EEG studies in human subjects and facilitate the comparability of data across laboratories, thus enabling data-pooling and meta-analyses. The recommended standard experimental procedure is to measure EEG activity under vigilance-controlled and resting conditions. The IPEG guidelines thoroughly present the technical details and therefore constitute a robust reference. The complementary aim of the present paper is to focus on practical aspects, pitfalls and precautions to be considered when processing pharmaco-EEG data by covering the following topics: (1) investigate the stability and reliability of 5-min EEG recordings under both vigilance-controlled and resting conditions; (2) assess the spontaneous time-dependent changes in spectral activity over time, and (3) apply the data-processing strategies suggested in the pharmaco-EEG guidelines and designed to optimally capture drug effects. For this purpose, the EEG data from a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial aimed at comparing the effect of diazepam (10 mg) and placebo in 16 healthy male volunteers is used to illustrate the discussion of the processing techniques and difficulties commonly faced when analysing pharmaco-EEG data.

DOI: 10.1097/WNR.0b013e328361eb19	Increased coherence imaging values, as determined by magnetoencephalography, are indicative of increased neural excitability. The purpose of this investigation was to examine coherence imaging values in patients suffering from panic disorder (PD). We also ascertained whether regions with increased coherence had higher representation in the limbic frontotemporal regions (LFTRs). The highest coherence imaging values and their locations, among 54 Brodmann areas, were determined in six PD patients and six age-matched healthy controls. Magnetoencephalography scans were acquired using 148 magnetometer channels and 32 simultaneous EEG channels. Despite the small sample size, coherence imaging values were significantly higher in PD patients. Brain regions with increased coherence were significantly more in areas typically associated with LFTRs in PD patients when compared with controls. The above data suggest that coherence values may be increased in LFTRs of patients with PD. Recent advances in epilepsy research suggest that increased coherence may reflect increased excitability in these brain regions. On the basis of the data provided here as well as in the available literature, we propose that additional research examining coherence values in LFTRs of PD patients could inform the choice of medication in this patient population, with increased coherence (i.e. increased excitability) being a biomarker for favorable responses to medications that limit excitatory transmission, such as benzodiazepines or antiseizure drugs.

Antagonistic effect of flumazenil after midazolam sedation on arterial-cardiac baroreflex.	DOI: 10.1111/aas.12035	Flumazenil is generally administered to antagonise the sedative effect of midazolam. However, although flumazenil completely antagonises the sedative effect of midazolam, a few effects remain unantagonised. Hence, it is unclear whether flumazenil restores the attenuation of the arterial-cardiac baroreflex (i.e. arterial-heart rate reflex) induced by midazolam. We investigated the antagonistic effect of flumazenil administered after midazolam on cardiac baroreflex, to reveal whether complete recovery from midazolam-induced sedation by flumazenil administration is accompanied by restoration of midazolam's attenuating effects on the cardiac baroreflex.

Intranasal midazolam: pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics assessed by quantitative EEG in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1038/clpt.2011.316	The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a highly concentrated cyclodextrin-based intranasal (i.n.) midazolam formulation containing the absorption-enhancer chitosan were studied in 12 healthy volunteers and compared with intravenous (i.v.) midazolam. The pharmacodynamic (PD) effects were assessed using quantitative electroencephalography (EEG). Maximal plasma concentrations of 63 and 110 ng/ml were reached at 8.4 and 7.6 min after 3 and 6 mg i.n. midazolam, respectively. After 5 mg i.v. and 6 and 3 mg i.n. midazolam, the times to onset of significant EEG effects in the β2 band (18-25 Hz) were 1.2, 5.5, and 6.9 min, respectively, and the times to loss of response to auditory stimuli were 3.0, 8.0, and 15.0 min, respectively. A sigmoid maximum-effect (E(max)) model indicated disequilibrium between plasma and effect-site concentrations, with equilibration half-lives of 2.1-4.8 min. The observed pharmacokinetic-PD (PK-PD) properties suggest that i.n. midazolam deserves to be evaluated as an easy and noninvasive method of administering a first benzodiazepine dose, e.g., in out-of-hospital emergency settings with no immediate i.v. access.

The quantitative electroencephalogram and the low-resolution electrical tomographic analysis in posttraumatic stress disorder.	DOI: 10.1177/1550059411428716	The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the recording of the brain electrical activity as measured on the scalp. Using mathematical algorithms, the 3-dimensional (3D) distribution of the electrical potential inside the brain can be calculated. One of the methods to calculate it is the low-resolution electrical tomographic analysis (LORETA). In this research, we seek to find the brain structures that differentiate patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from controls. Ten right-handed consenting adult male patients were recruited from a PTSD clinic. All patients fulfilled Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR]) criteria for chronic PTSD (duration >2 years.) and were on drug treatment regimens that had been stable for at least 2 months (involving only serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and benzodiazepines).The control group consisted of 10 healthy hospital staff members. All study participants underwent 19 channel EEG measurements according to current standards of practice. All artifact-free EEG strips were examined for spectral as well as LORETA analysis focusing on the theta (4-7 Hz) band which is suggested to reflect the activity of the limbic system. The theta band showed a statistically significant difference (P < .05) between the 2 groups in the right temporal lobe and in both the right and left frontal lobes. Our findings support existing research data obtained via other imaging technologies, which demonstrated structural alterations in the right temporal and frontal areas in PTSD. These results indicate that combining quantitative EEG (QEEG) and the LORETA method, among other methods, may improve the neuroanatomical resolution of EEG data analysis.

Neuroradiological and neurofunctional examinations for patients with 22q11.2 deletion.	DOI: 10.1055/s-0031-1295479	Since the neuroradiological features of patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are not well-understood, examinations using functional imaging were performed in this study. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were performed using a clinical 3-Tesla MR imager in 4 patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (2 boys and 2 girls; aged 2-6 years.) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Furthermore, interictal 123I-iomazenil (IMZ) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was examined in 2 of the 4 patients. Among the 4 patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, 2 patients showed polymicrogyria and 1 patient showed agyria. Those patients with brain malformations also showed abnormal brain artery patterns and decreased accumulation of IMZ in 123I-IMZ SPECT. Although all 4 patients showed epileptic discharges in their electroencephalograms (EEG), one patient with polymicrogyria had no seizure episodes. Decreases in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) corresponding to the areas of polymicrogyria and/or epileptic discharges in EEG were shown in all patients except for the patient with agyria. Although consistent evidence was not seen in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in this study, brain malformations and disturbances of the GABAergic nervous system would be underlying mechanisms of the neurodevelopmental abnormalities in this syndrome.

The role of GABAergic modulation in motor function related neuronal network activity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.025	At rest, the primary motor cortex (M1) exhibits spontaneous neuronal network oscillations in the beta (15-30 Hz) frequency range, mediated by inhibitory interneuron drive via GABA-A receptors. However, questions remain regarding the neuropharmacological basis of movement related oscillatory phenomena, such as movement related beta desynchronisation (MRBD), post-movement beta rebound (PMBR) and movement related gamma synchronisation (MRGS). To address this, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the movement related oscillatory changes in M1 cortex of eight healthy participants, following administration of the GABA-A modulator diazepam. Results demonstrate that, contrary to initial hypotheses, neither MRGS nor PMBR appear to be GABA-A dependent, whilst the MRBD is facilitated by increased GABAergic drive. These data demonstrate that while movement-related beta changes appear to be dependent upon spontaneous beta oscillations, they occur independently of one other. Crucially, MRBD is a GABA-A mediated process, offering a possible mechanism by which motor function may be modulated. However, in contrast, the transient increase in synchronous power observed in PMBR and MRGS appears to be generated by a non-GABA-A receptor mediated process; the elucidation of which may offer important insights into motor processes.

Drug effect on EEG connectivity assessed by linear and nonlinear couplings.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.20881	Quantitative analysis of human electroencephalogram (EEG) is a valuable method for evaluating psychopharmacological agents. Although the effects of different drug classes on EEG spectra are already known, interactions between brain locations remain unclear. In this work, cross mutual information function and appropriate surrogate data were applied to assess linear and nonlinear couplings between EEG signals. The main goal was to evaluate the pharmacological effects of alprazolam on brain connectivity during wakefulness in healthy volunteers using a cross-over, placebo-controlled design. Eighty-five pairs of EEG leads were selected for the analysis, and connectivity was evaluated inside anterior, central, and posterior zones of the scalp. Connectivity between these zones and interhemispheric connectivity were also measured. Results showed that alprazolam induced significant changes in EEG connectivity in terms of information transfer in comparison with placebo. Trends were opposite depending on the statistical characteristics: decreases in linear connectivity and increases in nonlinear couplings. These effects were generally spread over the entire scalp. Linear changes were negatively correlated, and nonlinear changes were positively correlated with drug plasma concentrations; the latter showed higher correlation coefficients. The use of both linear and nonlinear approaches revealed the importance of assessing changes in EEG connectivity as this can provide interesting information about psychopharmacological effects.

Expanded studies of the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of multidose sublingual triazolam in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1097/JCP.0b013e3181b5f45e	Previous work described the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of multidose sublingual triazolam (Halcion; Pharmacia & Upjohn Co, Kalamazoo, Mich). This laboratory study evaluated the hypothesis that incremental dosing of triazolam produces dose-dependent central nervous system depression that is profound and long lasting. Forty-nine healthy adults between the ages of 21 and 39 years, not receiving dental treatment, were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 12) or 1 of 3 triazolam groups (0.25-mg single dose, n = 12; 0.5 mg divided between 2 equal doses for 60 minutes, n = 12; or 0.75 mg divided among 3 doses for 90 minutes, n = 13). Plasma triazolam concentrations were determined. Bispectral index (BIS) and the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale were used to assess sedation. Plasma triazolam concentrations increased with time in all subjects, with Tmax and Cmax both increasing dose dependently. Compared with placebo, all dosing paradigms produced dose-dependent BIS suppression and sedation. The single dose of 0.25 mg reached its peak BIS suppression at 90 (81 +/- 7) minutes and sedation at 120 (3.6 +/- 0.5) minutes and returned to baseline before 360 minutes. In contrast, incremental dosing of 0.5 and 0.75 mg produced profound and long-lasting BIS suppression and sedation that did not plateau until either 180 or 210 minutes as measured by the BIS index (67 +/- 14 and 60 +/- 16 at 0.5 and 0.75 mg, respectively) and 150 minutes as measured by the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale (3.2 +/- 1.0 and 2.7 +/- 0.4 at 0.5 and 0.75 mg, respectively). These data more fully characterize the effects of incremental dosing with sublingual triazolam and provide additional insight for discharge safety recommendations.

Effect of flumazenil on bispectral index monitoring in unpremedicated patients.	DOI: 10.1097/ALN.0b013e31819db2c4	Flumazenil is an imidazobenzodiazepine that promptly reverses via competitive inhibition the hypnotic/sedative effects of benzodiazepines on gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. Endogenous benzodiazepine ligands (endozepines) were isolated in urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and breast milk of women who had not received benzodiazepines. The bispectral index (BIS), an electroencephalographically derived parameter widely used for monitoring the effects of anesthetic/hypnotic drugs, was shown to correlate to various conditions that could influence electroencephalography. The authors examined the hypothesis that 0.5 mg of flumazenil administered to healthy unpremedicated patients during deep surgical remifentanil/propofol anesthesia would increase the BIS value and might expedite recovery from anesthesia.

Progesterone reduces wakefulness in sleep EEG and has no effect on cognition in healthy postmenopausal women.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.05.013	Sleep is frequently impaired in postmenopausal women. Progesterone prompted benzodiazepine-like effects on sleep EEG in young normal male subjects. Aim of this study was to test if treatment with progesterone improves sleep after menopause. A randomised double blind crossover design study with 2 treatment intervals of 21 days duration separated by a 2 weeks washout was performed. An oral dose of 300 mg micronized progesterone was given each for 21 days. At the beginning and the end of the two intervals a sleep EEG was recorded and cognitive performance was assessed in 10 healthy postmenopausal women (age: 54-70 years). Progesterone treatment led to a decrease of intermittent time spent awake. During the first third of the night rapid eye movement (REM) sleep increased. The spectral analysis of the EEG resulted in no significant differences of the power spectra. Progesterone did not affect cognitive performance. In summary progesterone demonstrated a distinct sleep promoting effect by reduction of time of wake without impairing cognitive functions during daytime. As possible mechanisms of progesterone a GABA-agonistic effect and the regulation of gene expression via the progesterone receptor are discussed. Progesterone might be useful in the treatment of sleep disturbances of postmenopausal women.

"High frequency localised ""hot spots"" in temporal lobes of patients with intractable tinnitus: a quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) study."	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2007.08.034	"Tinnitus, the perception of noise in the absence of an external auditory stimulus, is common, frequently distressing and often intractable. It is associated with a number of conditions including deafness but may arise spontaneously. Brain imaging studies indicate increased neuronal excitability and decreased density of benzodiazepine receptors in temporal (auditory) cortex but the source and mechanism of such changes are unknown. Various electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities involving temporal lobe and other brain areas have been described but recordings have been limited to standard EEG wave bands up to frequencies of 22Hz. This clinical study of otherwise healthy patients with intractable unilateral tinnitus, using quantitative EEG power spectral mapping (QEEG), identified discrete localised unilateral foci of high frequency activity in the gamma range (>40-80Hz) over the auditory cortex in eight patients experiencing tinnitus during recording. These high frequency ""hot spots"" were not present in 25 subjects without tinnitus. The results suggest that further EEG investigations should include recordings in the gamma frequency range since such high frequency oscillations are believed to be necessary for perception. Identification of ""hot spots"" in tinnitus patients would provide a means for monitoring the effects of new treatments. These findings may also provide a model for exploration of more complex phenomena such as verbal and musical hallucinations."

DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2007.06.001	Cognitive dysfunctions may be a significant factor in drug-seeking behavior, reducing the efficiency of rehabilitation in opioid dependence. Neurophysiological basis of these dysfunctions is poorly understood. 21 opioid-dependent patients and 15 healthy controls with no experience of illicit drugs were studied with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Among opioid dependents 15 were benzodiazepine co-dependent. In a passive oddball paradigm, a train of 700-Hz standard tones (80%), presented to the left ear, was occasionally interrupted by infrequent deviants, which were either 600-Hz or 400-Hz pure tones or complex novel sounds. The auditory evoked potentials (AEP) and fields (AEF) were analyzed. The strength of the N1m dipoles was enhanced in patients with benzodiazepine co-dependence, but the latency of the response or the source location was not changed. A delay of mismatch negativity (MMN) response of novel tones in EEG, and delay of P3am response on the contralateral hemisphere to stimulated ear in MEG in opioid-dependent patients were observed. There were no differences in source locations or strengths of the dipoles for P1m, MMNm, and P3am determined using equivalent current dipoles. There were no group differences in EEG amplitude measures. In conclusion, our results suggest delayed pre-attentive auditory processing of novel information in opioid dependence. Benzodiazepine co-dependence modulated N1m response.

Pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of multidose sublingual triazolam in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1097/01.jcp.0000186742.07148.da	Triazolam is increasing in popularity as a premedication prescribed by dentists to help their fearful and anxious patients tolerate the potentially aversive nature of some dental procedures. Recent anecdotal reports suggest that incremental sublingual dosing of triazolam may be an effective technique for producing conscious sedation in the dental setting. Although promising, no laboratory or clinical data have been available to evaluate the efficacy or safety of this approach. This study was designed to determine the pharmacokinetics and sedative effects of incremental sublingual dosing of triazolam (total, 1.0 mg) in healthy adults. Ten healthy adult volunteers received sublingual triazolam (0.25 mg) followed by additional doses after 60 (0.50 mg) and 90 (0.25 mg) minutes. Plasma triazolam concentrations, clinical effects (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score), and processed electroencephalogram (bispectral index score) were measured intermittently for 3 hours. Plasma triazolam concentrations (mean +/- SD, 5.1 +/- 1.1 ng/mL) and drug effects (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score, 2 +/- 1; and the bispectral index score, 62 +/- 16) were greatest in all subjects at the end of the 3-hour evaluation period. Eight of the subjects had Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scores consistent with the definition of deep sedation or general anesthesia (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score, <3) at some of the later time points in the 180 minutes of data collection. In comparison, 4 of the subjects had bispectral index scores less than 60 during these later time points of data collection. Given the considerable intersubject variability in triazolam concentrations and effects, additional research is needed to assess this multidosing strategy before it can be endorsed as a useful and safe sedation technique for managing fearful and anxious patients in dental practice.

A neurophysiological study of the detrimental effects of alprazolam on human action monitoring.	DOI: 10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2005.08.009	In order to adapt their behavior to different unexpected situations, humans need to be able to monitor their performance and detect and correct errors. Benzodiazepines have long been shown to impair performance in humans, but the performance-related neurophysiological processes targeted by these drugs remain largely unknown. In the present article, we assessed the impact of alprazolam administration on relevant aspects of action monitoring, i.e., the monitoring of response conflict and the detection and correction of errors by means of neurophysiological measures. Multichannel event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded to assess the impact of the benzodiazepine alprazolam (0.25 mg and 1.00 mg) on action monitoring and motor preparation in a group of twelve healthy male volunteers who participated in a double-blind cross-over placebo-controlled clinical trial involving a letter flanker task. Error detection was evaluated using the error-related negativity (ERN); response conflict on correct trials was measured by means of the N2 amplitude difference between congruent and incongruent trials; motor preparation was assessed by means of the lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs); and post-error adjustments were assessed by measuring post-error slowing in reaction time. Alprazolam significantly reduced the amplitude of the ERN and the number of corrective responses and increased reaction time and LRP latencies. The drug had no effect on amplitude differences in the N2 component between congruent and incongruent trials or on post-error slowing. Thus, alprazolam was shown to affect brain correlates of error detection (ERN) and motor preparation (LRPs), while it did not disturb conflict monitoring on correct trials (N2) or post-error adjustments of behavior.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) shortens sleep latency but does not suppress ACTH and cortisol in depressed patients and normal controls.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.05.015	Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that neuropeptide Y (NPY) exerts functional corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) antagonistic effects. NPY activity appears to be blunted in depression. Recently, we have found in young normal male controls after repetitive administration of NPY a shortened sleep latency and a decrease of time awake and, in the second half of the night, EEG delta-power; cortisol and ACTH levels were blunted. Since during depression there is an overactivity of CRH, we tested the capacity of NPY to affect sleep endocrine activity in patients with depression compared with controls. After one night of adaptation we administered hourly IV injections of placebo (PL) during the second night and of 50 microg NPY during the third night between 22:00 and 01:00 h. Throughout the night ACTH, cortisol and prolactin levels were measured, simultaneously the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Depressed patients as well as healthy controls exhibited significant shortening of sleep onset latency (SOL) (mean+/-SD; controls: 41.9+/-48.2 min PL vs 22.1+/-17.3 min NPY; patients: 31.8+/-19.8 min PL vs 24.7+/-20.1 min NPY; P<0.06) and REM latency (controls: 79.3+/-27.5 min PL vs 69.0+/-19.4 min NPY; patients: 79.8+/-45.5 min PL vs 52.4+/-51.2 min NPY; P<0.05). Both patients and controls showed a trend to an increase of prolactin during the night. In contrast to our recent observation in young normal subjects time awake, ACTH and cortisol remained unchanged in patients and controls in response to NPY. Whereas also an adaptation effect may contribute to the shortening of SOL, this change and the prolactin elevation are in line with a CRH antagonistic and GABA(A) agonistic/benzodiazepine-like effect of NPY. The lack of effects on time awake and HPA hormones may be explained by the higher CRH activity due to age and depression in the investigated samples in comparison to our recent study in young subjects.

On the human sensorimotor-cortex beta rhythm: sources and modeling.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.02.008	Cortical oscillations in the beta band (13-35 Hz) are known to be modulated by the GABAergic agonist benzodiazepine. To investigate the mechanisms generating the approximately 20-Hz oscillations in the human cortex, we administered benzodiazepines to healthy adults and monitored cortical oscillatory activity by means of magnetoencephalography. Benzodiazepine increased the power and decreased the frequency of beta oscillations over rolandic areas. Minimum current estimates indicated the effect to take place around the hand area of the primary sensorimotor cortex. Given that previous research has identified sources of the beta rhythm in the motor cortex, our results suggest that these same motor-cortex beta sources are modulated by benzodiazepine. To explore the mechanisms underlying the increase in beta power with GABAergic inhibition, we simulated a conductance-based neuronal network comprising excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The model accounts for the increase in the beta power, the widening of the spectral peak, and the slowing down of the rhythms with benzodiazepines, implemented as an increase in GABAergic conductance. We found that an increase in IPSCs onto inhibitory neurons was more important for generating neuronal synchronization in the beta band than an increase in IPSCs onto excitatory pyramidal cells.

Age and gender effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of triazolam, a cytochrome P450 3A substrate.	DOI: 10.1016/j.clpt.2004.07.009	Sixty-one healthy men and women, aged 20 to 75 years, received single 0.25-mg doses of triazolam, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A substrate benzodiazepine, and placebo in a double-blind crossover study. Among women, age had no significant effect on area under the triazolam plasma concentration curve (AUC) (Spearman r=0.14, P=.44) or clearance (r =-0.09, P=.62). Among men, AUC increased (r=0.43, P <.02) and clearance declined (r=-0.42, P <.02) with increasing age. Gender differences in triazolam kinetics were not apparent. Compared with placebo, triazolam impaired digit-symbol substitution test performance, increased observer-rated sedation, impaired delayed recall of information learned at 1.5 hours after dosing, and increased electroencephalographic beta amplitude. Among men, mean values of relative digit-symbol substitution test decrement (P <.002) and observer-rated sedation (P <.05) were significantly greater in elderly subjects compared with young subjects. Age-dependent differences among women reached significance for observer-rated sedation (P <.02). A combination of higher plasma levels and increased intrinsic sensitivity explained the greater pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam in elderly subjects. Although the findings are consistent with reduced clearance of triazolam in elderly men, individual variability was large and was not explained by identifiable demographic or environmental factors.

Heart rate variability during sleep in patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine.	DOI: 10.1097/00004850-200411000-00002	Cardiac adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics have gained increasing interest in recent years. In the present study, heart rate variability (HRV), which is a sensitive parameter reflecting central autonomic cardiac control, was investigated during treatment with olanzapine. Ten physically healthy male patients with schizophrenia, who displayed predominantly negative symptoms, were studied in the sleep laboratory under drug-free baseline conditions and after 4 weeks of olanzapine medication. HRV was assessed during different sleep stages both in the time and frequency domains. Only slight changes in HRV were shown during treatment, and appeared to be independent of sleep stages. Spectral analysis indicated a slight shift of the sympathovagal balance in favour of the sympathetic tone, which was consistent with an elevation of heart rate in the time domain; total HRV was not altered. These changes are in accordance with olanzapine's receptor profile exerting anticholinergic and anti-adrenergic properties. In conclusion, taken together with findings from previous studies demonstrating that olanzapine does not cause clinically significant changes of the QTc interval, the present results are consistent with the known cardiac safety profile of olanzapine.

Long-term olanzapine treatment and p300 parameters in schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1159/000079112	The well-known amplitude reduction of the P300 appears to be unaffected by the treatment with classical antipsychotics in schizophrenia, whereas the effects of atypical neuroleptics on this event-related potential are less understood. The study of these changes could help in deciding whether the P300 amplitude reduction in schizophrenia is a trait or state marker of that illness and in better describing the effect of atypical antipsychotics on altered cognitive functions. We present a prospective longitudinal study of P300 amplitude and latency before and after 6 months' treatment with olanzapine in 11 patients with schizophrenia. A healthy control group (n = 30) was also studied. Overall, no significant changes, either in amplitude or in latency as measured at Pz and Fz electrodes, were found when comparing the pre- and postolanzapine conditions, despite the overall improvement in positive and negative symptoms. Nevertheless a direct specific association was observed between a P300 amplitude increase with olanzapine and the improvement in negative symptoms. These data would suggest that P300 amplitude reduction in schizophrenia may be relatively independent from clinical state and treatment, thus constituting a trait marker of schizophrenia. Our data also suggest that, in addition to this, some further changes in P300 amplitude might depend on the clinical state of the patients.

EEG abnormalities associated with antipsychotics: a comparison of quetiapine, olanzapine, haloperidol and healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1002/hup.537	In this study the effects of the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine and olanzapine, and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol on EEG patterns were retrospectively investigated in 81 patients under stable monotherapy with either drug (quetiapine: n=22, olanzapine: n=37, haloperidol: n=22). These three subgroups were compared with a control group of healthy subjects (n=30) which were matched regarding sex and age. Diagnoses of patients were schizophrenia (DSM-IV 295.xx, n=61), brief psychotic disorder (DSM-IV 298.8, n=9), schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV 295.70, n=8) and delusional disorder (DSM-IV 297.1, n=3). There were no statistically significant differences regarding demographic characteristics between the groups. Digital EEG recordings were retrieved from a database and visually assessed by two independent investigators, and one blinded regarding medication. One patient from the quetiapine group (5%), 13 olanzapine patients (35%), five of the haloperidol patients (23%) and two subjects of the control group (7%) had an abnormal EEG. Epileptiform activity was observed in four patients (11%) of the olanzapine group, and none in the others. EEG abnormalities were statistically significantly increased with dose in the olanzapine group, in contrast to patients treated with haloperidol, quetiapine or healthy subjects. In conclusion, EEG abnormalities seem to occur rarely in patients treated with quetiapine comparable to the control group, but significantly more often with haloperidol and olanzapine, possibly due to different receptor profiles of these substances. To our knowledge, this is the first electrophysiological investigation comparing the new atypical antipsychotics quetiapine, haloperidol, olanzapine with healthy subjects.

The effect of diazepam on motor cortical oscillations and corticomuscular coherence studied in man.	DOI: 10.1113/jphysiol.2002.029553	EEG recordings from sensorimotor cortex show oscillations around 10 and 20 Hz. These modulate with task performance, and are strongest during periods of steady contraction. The 20 Hz oscillations are coherent with contralateral EMG. Computer modelling suggests that oscillations arising within the cortex may be especially dependent on inhibitory systems. The benzodiazepine diazepam enhances the size of GABA(A) IPSPs; its effects are reversed by the antagonist flumazenil. We tested the effect of these drugs on spectral measures of EEG and EMG, whilst eight healthy human subjects performed a precision grip task containing both holding and movement phases. Either an auxotonic or isometric load was used. EEG changes following electrical stimulation of the contralateral median nerve were also assessed. The EEG power showed similar changes in all task/stimulation protocols used. Power around 20 Hz doubled at the highest dose of diazepam used (5 mg), and returned to control levels following flumazenil. EEG power at 10 Hz was by contrast little altered. The peak frequency of EEG power in both bands was not changed by diazepam. Corticomuscular coherence at ca 20 Hz was reduced following diazepam injection, but the magnitude of this effect was small (mean coherence during steady holding in the auxotonic task was 0.062 in control recordings, 0.051 after 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses of diazepam). These results imply that 20 Hz oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex are at least partially produced by local cortical circuits reliant on GABA(A)-mediated intracortical inhibition, whereas 10 Hz rhythms arise by a different mechanism. Rhythms generated during different tasks, or following nerve stimulation, are likely to arise from similar mechanisms. By examining the formulae used to calculate coherence, we show that if cortical oscillations are simply transmitted to the periphery, corticomuscular coherence should increase in parallel with the ratio of EEG to EMG power. The relative constancy of coherence even when the amplitude of cortical oscillations is perturbed suggests that corticomuscular coherence itself may have a functional role in motor control.

Abnormalities of grey and white matter [11C]flumazenil binding in temporal lobe epilepsy with normal MRI.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awf233	In 20% of potential surgical candidates with refractory epilepsy, current optimal MRI does not identify the cause. GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and GABA(A) receptors are expressed by most neurones. [(11)C]Flumazenil (FMZ) PET images the majority of GABA(A) receptor subtypes. We investigated abnormalities of FMZ binding in grey and white matter in 18 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and normal quantitative MRI. Parametric images of FMZ volume of distribution (FMZ-V(d)) were calculated. Twenty-one healthy controls were scanned for comparison. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM99) was used to localize significant changes in FMZ-V(d) in individual patients and between groups, specifically including the entire white matter in all subjects through explicit masking. Sixteen of 18 patients showed single or multiple abnormalities of FMZ-V(d). Six had hippocampal decreases of FMZ-V(d). Eleven patients showed increased FMZ-V(d) in the temporal lobe white matter (TLWM). Outside the mesial temporal structures, seven showed multiple areas of increase or decrease and only one a single area of decrease. In seven of the 16 patients with abnormalities, findings were concordant with EEG and clinical data, enabling further presurgical evaluation. Group findings were: (i) decreased FMZ-V(d) in the ipsilateral (Z = 3.01) and contralateral (Z = 2.56) hippocampus; (ii) increased FMZ-V(d) in the ipsilateral (Z = 3.71) and contralateral TLWM (two clusters, Z = 3.11 and 2.79); and (iii) increased FMZ-V(d) in the ipsilateral frontal lobe white matter between the superior and medial frontal gyrus (Z = 3.80) with similar changes contralaterally (Z = 4.87). No changes were found in the thalamus and basal ganglia. Region-of-interest analyses indicated an average increase in FMZ binding of 16% in the TLWM ipsilateral to the epileptic focus. PET findings were corroborated by invasive EEG or pathology in five cases. FMZ-PET, analysed by SPM with explicit masking, was sensitive in patients with normal MRI, and hippocampal abnormalities were detected in a third of these patients. Furthermore, increases in FMZ binding in TLWM, indicating microdysgenesis, were detected in the majority of these patients and may represent the structural basis of their epilepsy.

Healthy males (9) and females (9) received a single-dose (5 mg) of diazepam or placebo. EEG was recorded with eyes open (FP1, FP2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2) before and 2 h after drug administration in two counterbalanced sessions. DZ selectively increased delta and theta EEG correlation among frontal regions and decreased it between right parieto-occipital (theta) and fronto-central regions (alpha2) in addition to an increase in beta2 interhemispheric correlation in men and women. Men showed increased beta1 interhemispheric correlation, decreased alpha1 and increased beta power; women showed in addition, decreased theta and alpha2 power. theta rhythm was more sensitive to DZ in women, whereas interhemispheric correlation was more affected in men. DZ had a sexually dimorphic effect on waking EEG and a disrupting effect on coherent activity, increasing balance among frontal regions and decreasing temporal coupling between anterior-posterior regions. These sex differences might be related to differences in brain organization and activational effects of female gonadal steroids which are higher in women than in men.

Effect of a single-dose of olanzapine on sleep in healthy females and males.	DOI: 10.1097/00004850-200207000-00004	The effect of a single dose of 10 mg olanzapine on healthy volunteers of both sexes was examined using polysomnography and power spectral analysis. The structure and continuity of sleep were unaffected by olanzapine in both sexes. The increase in both actual sleep time and slow wave sleep in females correlated with the increase in theta power, while delta power was not significantly elevated, suggesting that theta power may be a sensitive indicator of changes in sleep. The changes in sleep had the same tendency in men, but they were not significant. The difference between the sexes could not be explained by differences in body mass index. Olanzapine affects sleep probably through 5-HT(2C) receptors. The receptor gene is located on the X-chromosome, inducing an allelic difference between the females and males. This difference may contribute to the different effects of olanzapine on sleep. Olanzapine seems to preserve the normal structure of sleep and increase the amount of slow-wave sleep, which might be of additional benefit in treatment of schizophrenia. The effective clinical dose may be lower for females than males.

Visual event-related potentials in cirrhotic patients without overt encephalopathy: the effects of flumazenil.	DOI: 10.1023/a:1011662411913	The P300 complex was derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG) as subjects mentally counted infrequent large checkerboard visual stimuli, presented randomly among frequent small checkerboard stimuli. Use of low contrast (10%) stimuli and four midline scalp electrodes, facilitated separation of cognitive and sensory components and enabled the P300 complex to be resolved into three distinct components--N200, P3a, and P3b. In 20 healthy adult subjects normative data were established and the P3a and P3b components were shown to depend on cognitive function. In 19 age-matched cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) the EEG and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were normal, but latencies of P3a and/or P3b were prolonged in 9. Prolonged latencies were not associated with an abnormal number connection test. Ten additional age-matched cirrhotic patients without overt HE, who were alcohol, drug, and caffeine free, were randomized to receive flumazenil (1 mg) and placebo intravenously, double-blind. After flumazenil or placebo, latencies of P3a and P3b and psychometric test results did not change significantly. These findings suggest that in cirrhotic patients without overt HE (i) impaired cognitive sensory function may occur in the absence of abnormalities of a standard psychometric test, the EEG, or VEPs, and (ii) increased latencies of P3a and P3b may constitute a component of subclinical HE, which is not mediated by increased brain levels of central benzodiazepine receptor agonist ligands.

Effect of midazolam on transfer function between beat-to-beat arterial pressure and inter-beat interval length.	DOI: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.bja.a013432	Arterial pressure (AP) and inter-beat interval (IBI) length are under autonomic nervous system control. The control mechanisms can be investigated by transfer function analysis. It is not known if this type of analysis may be helpful in monitoring depth of sedation. In an open-label, uncontrolled investigation, the effect of midazolam on the transfer function between AP and IBI, and on spectral indices of AP and heart rate (HR) variability (APV, HRV) were assessed in the absence and presence of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. We studied 11 healthy male volunteers. After an initial control period of 60 min, we studied three consecutive periods, each of 60 min duration, with progressively increasing concentrations of midazolam (0.02, 0.06, 0.14 mg kg-1 h-1). A final 60-min period during administration of flumazenil 0.004 mg kg-1 h-1 and while the agonist was still present was also studied. To confirm midazolam-induced central nervous system effects, electroencephalography was performed and Ramsay sedation scores were determined. With increasing dose of midazolam, the high frequency (0.15-0.4 Hz) component of the transfer function between AP and IBI decreased progressively (mean 26.5 (SEM 3.7), 19.2 (2.9), 12.8 (1.7), 8.4 (1.6) ms mm Hg-1). This effect was antagonized by flumazenil (21.5 (3.2) ms mm Hg-1). Other indices (e.g. HRV, APV) did not reveal such a clear response to midazolam dose and flumazenil application. Thus in healthy male volunteers, the transfer function between AP and IBI in the parasympathetically dominated high frequency range varies according to benzodiazepine agonism and antagonism. This finding has potential implications for monitoring the effects of benzodiazepines.

Comparative kinetics and response to the benzodiazepine agonists triazolam and zolpidem: evaluation of sex-dependent differences.		Eighteen healthy volunteers (10 men and 8 women) participated in a single-dose, double-blind, three-way crossover pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study. Treatment conditions were 0.25 mg of triazolam, a full-agonist benzodiazepine ligand; 10 mg of zolpidem, an imidazopyridine having relative selectivity for the type 1 benzodiazepine receptor subtype; and placebo. Weight-normalized clearance of triazolam was higher in women than in men (8.7 versus 5. 5 ml/min/kg), but the difference was not significant. In contrast, zolpidem clearance was lower in women than in men (3.5 versus 6.7 ml/min/kg, P <.06). Compared to placebo, both active medications produced significant benzodiazepine agonist-like pharmacodynamic effects: sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, impaired information recall, and increased electroencephalographic beta-amplitude. Effects of triazolam and zolpidem in general were comparable and less than 8 h in duration. There was no evidence of a substantial or consistent sex difference in pharmacodynamic effects or in the kinetic-dynamic relationship, although subtle differences could not be ruled out due to low statistical power. The complete dependence of triazolam clearance on CYP3A activity, as opposed to the mixed CYP participation in zolpidem clearance, may explain the differing sex effects on clearance of the two compounds.

Placebo-controlled sleep laboratory studies on the acute effects of zolpidem on objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality in nonorganic insomnia related to neurotic and stress-related disorder.	DOI: 10.1159/000026646	Recent investigations in our sleep outpatient clinic demonstrated that 30% of patients exhibited organic and 70% nonorganic sleep disorders, with 41% showing as an additional diagnosis neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, 31% affective disorders and 15% mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use. Thus, the aim of the study was to investigate the acute effects of the imidazopyridine zolpidem on objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality in the largest of the above-mentioned groups. In this single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study, 15 patients (9 females and 6 males aged 51.1 + 11. 3 years) diagnosed as having nonorganic insomnia (ICD-10: F 51.0) related to neurotic and stress-related disorders (F 1.1:12, F 41.2:2 and F 43.2:1) were included. Objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality measures were investigated in 3 subsequent nights in the sleep laboratory (adaptation, baseline/placebo and zolpidem 10 mg night), utilizing clinical, polysomnographic, psychometric and psychophysiological methods. The drug-free patients were matched according to age and sex with 15 normal healthy controls (age 51.2 + 11.8 years). Statistical analysis of polysomnographic variables demonstrated a significant lengthening of the total sleep period (TSP) and total sleep time (TST), an improvement in sleep efficiency and a shortening of sleep latencies after zolpidem as compared with placebo. These changes were opposite to the differences between patients and controls. Concerning sleep architecture, zolpidem increased the length of S4 and S3 + S4 as compared with placebo. Subjective sleep and awakening quality and the thymopsychic variables drive, mood, affectivity and wakefulness in the morning showed no significant changes, as a significant improvement had already occurred from the adaptation to the baseline/placebo night. Noopsychic variables (attention, concentration, attention variability, numerical memory, fine motor activity, reaction time measures) showed similar findings. Moreover, subjective sleep and awakening quality, thymopsychic and noopsychic measures during baseline/placebo recordings did not differ significantly from normative data (except for fine motor activity). Psychophysiological measures did not show any significant alterations either, except for a decrease in systolic blood pressure in the evening.

Quantitative measure of complexity of EEG signal dynamics.	DOI: 10.55782/ane-1999-1316	Since electroencephalographic (EEG) signal may be considered chaotic, Nonlinear Dynamics and Deterministic Chaos Theory may supply effective quantitative descriptors of EEG dynamics and of underlying chaos in the brain. We have used Karhunen-Loeve decomposition of the covariance matrix of the EEG signal to analyse EEG signals of 4 healthy subjects, under drug-free condition and under the influence of Diazepam. We found that what we call KL-complexity of the signal differs profoundly for the signals registered in different EEG channels, from about 5-8 for signals in frontal channels up to 40 and more in occipital ones. But no consistency in the influence of Diazepam administration on KL-complexity is observed. We also estimated the embedding dimension of the EEG signals of the same subjects, which turned to be between 7 and 11, so endorsing the presumption about existence of low-dimensional chaotic attractor. We are sure that nonlinear time series analysis can be used to investigate the dynamics underlying the generation of EEG signal. This approach does not seem practical yet, but deserves further study.

Single-dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam in elderly and young subjects.	DOI: 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1998.tb04370.x	The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic alprazolam (1 mg orally) were compared between young and elderly healthy volunteers. Eight young subjects (mean age 29.8 years) and eight elderly volunteers (mean age 68.4 years) received oral placebo and alprazolam (1.0 mg) in a randomized, double-blind, single-dose crossover study. In the elderly subjects, plasma concentrations were higher, although not significantly so, than in young volunteers 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 hours after dosage. Apparent elimination half-life, time of maximum concentration, maximum concentration, volume of distribution, and apparent clearance were similar for the two groups. In both groups, alprazolam treatment (versus placebo) produced significant changes in typical benzodiazepine agonist effects, such as increased sedation and fatigue, reduced excitement, increased feelings of spaciness, and perception of thinking slowed. For some measures, the alprazolam-placebo difference was greater in young than in elderly subjects. In both groups, alprazolam significantly impaired performance on the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST). EEG studies indicated significant increases in relative beta amplitude (13-30 Hz range) after alprazolam compared to placebo. Percent DSST decrement and percent EEG change were highly correlated with plasma alprazolam concentrations for both groups. There were modest increases in alprazolam plasma concentration in the elderly compared to the younger group shortly after drug administration, but there was no evidence of increased sensitivity to the pharmacodynamic effects of alprazolam in the elderly.

Regional hippocampal [11C]flumazenil PET in temporal lobe epilepsy with unilateral and bilateral hippocampal sclerosis.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/120.10.1865	Using statistical parametric mapping and [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) PET we have previously shown reduction of central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR) binding restricted to the hippocampus in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy due to unilateral hippocampal sclerosis. However, bilateral hippocampal pathology can be present in up to 50% of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Additionally, the limited spatial resolution of PET results in a partial volume effect that affects quantitative analysis of cBZRs and such an effect can mask hippocampal dysfunction. We analysed changes in the [11C]FMZ volume of distribution (FMZ-Vd) before and after correction for partial volume effect in six patients with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and a quantitative MRI diagnosis of bilateral hippocampal sclerosis, which appeared either symmetrical on MRI (bilateral symmetrical hippocampal sclerosis; three patients) or bilateral but asymmetrical (asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis; three patients), and in nine patients with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and unilateral hippocampal sclerosis on MRI than was subsequently histologically verified. Fifteen healthy controls were also studied for comparison. Before correction for partial volume effects, significant unilateral reductions of FMZ-Vd were found in one of the three patients with bilateral symmetrical hippocampal sclerosis, in one of the three asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis patients and in six of the nine unilateral hippocampal sclerosis patients. No significant bilateral reductions of hippocampal FMZ-Vd were detected. After correction for partial volume effect, all three patients with bilateral symmetrical hippocampal sclerosis showed significant bilateral reductions of FMZ-Vd, and these were asymmetrical in two. All three patients with asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis and all nine patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis on MRI showed unilateral reductions of FMZ-Vd concordant with the side of the EEG focus. In addition one of the three patients with asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis and three of the nine patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis showed significant reductions of FMZ-Vd in the hippocampus contralateral to the side of the EEG focus. Absolute quantification of [11C]FMZ-PET, corrected for partial volume effect, within multiple hippocampal volumes of interest was necessary in order to detect bilateral changes of cBZR in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis with optimal sensitivity. This [11C]FMZ-PET approach was able to demonstrate subtle contralateral abnormalities in one-third of patients thought to have unilateral or bilateral asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis on MRI. Reduction of cBZR binding was consistently over and above loss of hippocampal volume indicating that atrophy is not the sole determinant of cBZR loss in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

Chronic alcohol abuse and the acute sedative and neurophysiologic effects of midazolam.	DOI: 10.1007/s002130050404	The aim of the present investigation was to examine benzodiazepine sensitivity in abstinent alcoholics. For this purpose, two escalating doses of the benzodiazepine midazolam were i.v. administered to nine alcohol-dependent patients after 2-3 weeks of abstinence and 12 healthy, non-alcoholic volunteers. A variety of dependent measures were examined, including the power spectrum of the resting electroencephalogram (EEG) and evoked EEG responses, saccadic eye movements, self-reported sedation, and vigilance task performance. Analyses revealed a significant association between plasma midazolam levels and changes in EEG beta power, pattern shift visual evoked potential amplitude, heart rate, and saccade amplitude and velocity. The patient and control groups differed significantly in the onset latencies of their saccadic eye movements, and marginally in EEG beta power, both before and after midazolam. However, no differences were detected between the groups in the dose of midazolam required to produce sedation or in midazolam's neurophysiological effects.

Event-related potentials in a passive and active auditory condition: effects of diazepam and buspirone on slow wave positivity.	DOI: 10.1016/s0301-0511(96)05237-4	The effects of single, oral doses of diazepam (10 mg), buspirone (10 mg) and placebo on auditory event-related potentials were assessed in healthy volunteers. Subjects received two series of auditory stimuli: a series of identical stimuli presented in a neutral, passive condition and a series of identical standard tones (P = 0.8), but now intermixed with target tones (P = 0.2), in an active, oddball condition. The analysis focused on the average value of the potential in two different phases, from 250 till 574 ms post-stimulus (including P300) and from 576 till 900 ms post-stimulus (including late slow wave positivity). Event-related potentials for the standards of the oddball task were compared with the potentials of the same stimuli presented in the neutral condition. In addition, the classical comparison between the target and the standard in the oddball task was made. The first comparison was designed to isolate any effect of a change in the level of vigilance and attention due to involvement in the oddball task. This effect was evident as an increase in positivity that was smaller in the diazepam condition. The second comparison was designed to isolate the distinctive processing associated with task-relevant stimuli. This revealed that the P300 was reduced in the 250-574 ms window in the diazepam group. Both results suggest that cognitive processing of relevant stimuli is reduced by diazepam. Presumably, this is associated with the sedative effects of this drug. Consistent with this interpretation, subjects under the influence of diazepam made more omissions in the detection of targets in the oddball condition and had longer reaction times. In contrast to diazepam, the anxiolytic buspirone did not appear to have measurable effects on cognition.

The assessment of residual effects of a single dose of diazepam on visually-defined EEG patterns.	DOI: 10.1177/026988119701100414	The aim of this single-blind study was to evaluate the residual effects of a 10-mg dose of diazepam on cortical activation 11 h after oral intake. The electroencephalographic segments (from O1-O2) delimited by a sequence of photic stimuli presented every 10 sec during a simple reaction-time task (36 min duration) were arbitrarily classified into nine cerebral patterns (EEGP). EEGP segment classifications were grouped into six peri-stimulus transitions expressed in percentages: alpha-blockade; alpha-persistence; beta-persistence; alpha-induction; activation and deactivation. A sample of 42 young healthy university students (21 females and 21 males) each underwent three counterbalanced experimental conditions (control, placebo and diazepam). Diazepam affected all the subjects, although the women showed a greater number of EEGP transitions which indicated deactivation, than did the men. The results show that this type of visual EEG analysis is a useful technique for detecting the residual effects of benzodiazepines.

Hypnotic and hypothermic effects of melatonin on daytime sleep in humans: lack of antagonism by flumazenil.

The design comprised four 7-h (1200-1900 h) testing periods, preceded by a 'no-treatment' adaptation period of the ""7/13' sleep-wake paradigm. Six young healthy adult males were paid to participate. During each experimental period, tablets were administered at 1145 h (flumazenil or placebo) and at 1200 h (melatonin or placebo) in a randomized, double-blind, partially repeated Latin square design. Polysomnographic recordings and core body temperature recordings revealed that melatonin, either in combination with placebo or with flumazenil, significantly increased the amounts of sleep, and decreased core body temperature in comparison with placebo alone or the combination of flumazenil plus placebo. These results do not support the hypothesis that melatonin exerts its hypothermic and hypnotic effects via the central benzodiazepine receptors."

Effects of a small dose of triazolam on P300 and resting EEG.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02249418	The aim of the present study was to clarify whether cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines (BDZs) are a consequence of their specific direct effects on cognitive function or whether they are explained as secondary effects of increased sleepiness. Ten healthy men (mean age, 33.9 years) participated in two experimental sessions in a randomized cross-over, double-blind study: in one session subjects were given a placebo and in the other they were given 0.125 mg triazolam (TRZ). Each experimental session was conducted on 1 day. After a pre-drug EEG recording and an event-related potential (ERP) recording, under an oddball paradigm, subjects took the TRZ or placebo orally at 1000 hours. Thereafter, EEG and ERP recording sessions, following the same procedure as the pre-drug sessions, were conducted at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after drug administration. The EEG and ERP recordings from Cz and Pz referred to the bilaterally linked ear electrodes were used. We found that P300 latency was significantly prolonged in TRZ condition at 2 h (Pz) and 4 h (Cz and Pz) after TRZ, and that the P300 amplitude was significantly reduced at 2 h (Cz and Pz) and 4 h (Pz) after TRZ, compared to the same times after placebo. The absolute power values for the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha 1 (8-9 Hz), and alpha 2 (10-12 Hz) bands did not differ at any measurement time between the treatments. Only the beta band (13-19 Hz) power value was significantly elevated after the TRZ administration (versus placebo). No significant sedative effects were detected in subjective measurements. These results indicate that a single oral dose of 0.125 mg TRZ caused cortical changes without distinct general sedation or subjective sleepiness.

Benzodiazepine site pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic quantification in man: direct measurement of drug occupancy and effects on the human brain in vivo.	DOI: 10.1016/s0028-3908(96)00072-x	"To date, the study of the relationship between drug occupancy and action in the brain has had to rely on the use of either animal models or of indirect kinetic measures in man, e.g. serum concentrations of unbound drug (as a measure of ""free"" drug in brain). We describe the first set of experiments which directly measure agonist-induced changes in both pharmacodynamic effects and pharmacokinetic parameters simultaneously and which demonstrate the feasibility of these studies in man. Five healthy volunteers each had two PET scans using [11C]flumazenil (a radiolabelled benzodiazepine site antagonist) as part of a study investigating kinetic models and the relationship between occupancy and effect of benzodiazepine site ligands. In both studies the [11C]flumazenil was displaced from the brain by infusion of midazolam administered i.v. 30 min into the scan. In one study a higher dose of midazolam was administered than in the other (range 12.5-50 micrograms/kg). Time-activity curves of the concentration of radioligand were derived in 17 different brain regions using a stereotactic automatic method of region selection. We demonstrated that there are significant differences in an index of occupancy, induced by the two different doses of midazolam, both across brain regions and within subjects. There was a significant correlation between measured occupancy index change and pharmacodynamic effects as measured by the peak change in beta 1 spectral power on EEG. There was no significant correlation between dose administered and EEG changes; plasma concentrations of midazolam were correlated with the occupancy index and with the EEG measures. In addition, we have demonstrated that a non-regional total index of brain occupancy can be obtained by analysing the non-tomographic data obtained with the PET scanner (total radioactivity counts head curve) and that this index shows significant correlations both with the dose administered and with the pharmacodynamic measure. This last finding validates the use of other non-tomographic counting techniques (Malizia et al., 1995a) where an index of displacement can be obtained after the administration of less than 1% of the dose of radiation needed for a PET study. These studies are likely to be useful in human psychopharmacology, in particular in the assessment of tolerance and of putative changes in benzodiazepine sensitivity in anxiety disorders. The same principles can be applied to other ligand studies and will be useful to validate current PK/PD models."

[11C]flumazenil positron emission tomography visualizes frontal epileptogenic regions.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1995.tb01066.x	Presently available noninvasive methods correctly localize epileptogenic regions in only approximately 50% of patients with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Earlier studies have shown that temporal lobe epileptogenic regions may be identified readily by positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of regional benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor binding. We tested the specific applicability of this method in patients with FLE. Six patients with frontal partial seizures and 7 healthy men were investigated with PET and the BZD receptor ligand [11C]flumazenil. All patients had magnetic resonance (MR) brain scans. The independent assessment of seizure-onset region was based on seizure semiology, intra- and extracranial EEG and, in 4 cases, also on [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET. The epileptic focus/seizure-generating region was correctly identified by [11C]flumazenil PET in all patients. This region was characterized by a significant reduction in BZD receptor density. The area with reduced BZD receptor density was better delimited than the corresponding hypometabolic region, which was observed in 50% of patients investigated with [18F]FDG-PET. MRI was normal in 5 patients. Visualization of BZD receptors with [11C]flumazenil PET appears to be a promising approach for noninvasive identification of frontal lobe epileptogenic regions.

Pharmacodynamic modeling of the electroencephalographic effects of flumazenil in healthy volunteers sedated with midazolam.	DOI: 10.1016/0009-9236(95)90177-9	The purpose of this study was to model pharmacodynamically the reversal of midazolam sedation with flumazenil. Ten human volunteers underwent four different sessions. In session 1, individual midazolam pharmacokinetics and electroencephalographic pharmacodynamics were determined. In sessions 2 and 3, a computer-controlled infusion of midazolam with individual volunteer pharmacokinetic data was administered, targeting a plasma concentration corresponding to a light or deep level of sedation (20% or 80% of the maximal midazolam electroencephalographic effect) for a period of 210 minutes. After obtaining a stable electroencephalographic effect and constant midazolam plasma concentrations, a zero-order infusion of flumazenil was started until complete reversal of midazolam electroencephalographic effect was obtained. The flumazenil infusion was then stopped and the volunteer was allowed to resedate because of the constant midazolam drug effect. The electroencephalographic response was measured during a 180-minute period and analyzed by aperiodic analysis and fast-Fourier transforms. In session 4, a midazolam plasma concentration corresponding to a deep level of sedation was targeted for 210 minutes to examine for the possible development of acute tolerance. No flumazenil was given in session 4. For a light sedation level, with a mean midazolam plasma concentration of 160 +/- 64 ng/ml, the mean half-life of the equilibration rate constant of flumazenil reversal is 5.0 +/- 2.5 minutes, and the mean effect site concentration causing 50% of Emax is 13.7 +/- 5.8 ng/ml. For a deep level of sedation, with a mean midazolam plasma concentration of 551 +/- 196 ng/ml, the mean half-life of the equilibration rate constant is 3.9 +/- 1.5 minutes, and the mean effect site concentration causing 50% of Emax is 20.6 +/- 6.8 ng/ml. This study provides an estimate of the magnitude of the blood/central nervous system equilibration delay for flumazenil antagonism of midazolam sedation and further defines the usefulness of the electroencephalogram as a measure of midazolam pharmacodynamic effect.

Effects of flumazenil on recovery sleep and hormonal secretion after sleep deprivation in male controls.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02245817	The effects of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, on the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and neuroendocrine secretion in early morning recovery sleep (0500-0800 hours) following sleep deprivation (SD; 2300-0500 hours) were studied in seven healthy men. SD induced an increase in slow wave sleep (SWS), a decrease in sleep onset latency (SOL), an enhancement of EEG delta and theta power in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, an increase in plasma human growth hormone (GH) concentration, and a decrease in plasma cortisol levels in recovery sleep (0500-0800 hours). Plasma GH, but neither plasma cortisol nor adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) concentration was attenuated during SD as compared to sleep (2300-0445 hours). The administration of flumazenil (3 x 1 mg intravenously) during recovery sleep resulted in an inhibition in SWS, an increase in stage 2 sleep, a selective reduction in delta and theta power, and a tendency to prolongation of SOL. Plasma GH concentration was decreased but plasma cortisol and ACTH remained unaffected. Since the SD-induced changes in sleep EEG and plasma GH secretion were antagonized by flumazenil, it is suggested that electrophysiological and hormonal effects of SD are mediated at least in part through GABAergic mechanisms.

Changes of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) parameters in situational insomnia under brotizolam and triazolam.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02311169	The standardized scoring criteria of sleep can serve as a rough tool for monitoring the effects of psychoactive compounds, both in normal sleepers and in insomniac patients. More sensitive information on the impact of perturbing factors and drugs during sleep is supplied by the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) parameters. In particular, CAP rate, which measures the amount of arousal instability during NREM sleep, has been proved of high reliability in a variety of clinical and pharmacological settings. The present study aimed at evaluating the activity of brotizolam (Br) 0.25 mg and triazolam (Tr) 0.25 mg on both conventional and CAP parameters in a model of situational insomnia of intermediate severity. Six middle-aged healthy subjects (three males and three females, aged 40-55 years) with no complaints about sleep, underwent a polysomnographic investigation according to a double-blind crossover design: placebo without noise (night 1), placebo with noise (night 2), brotizolam or triazolam without noise (nights 3 and 5), brotizolam or triazolam with noise (nights 4 and 6). The unperturbed nights consisted of standard recording conditions in a sound-protected sleep laboratory, whereas situational insomnia was accomplished by means of continuous white noise at 55 dBA delivered throughout the night. Subjects received medication orally at bedtime. An interval of at least 48 h was secured between consecutive recordings in the same individual. Compared to baseline conditions, situational insomnia was characterized by a shorter amount of total sleep (-40 min) and by an extension of intrasleep awakenings (+62 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Animals', 'Azepinestherapeutic use', 'Cricetinae', 'Electroencephalography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypnotics and Sedativestherapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Placebo Effect', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disordersdrug therapy', 'Sleep Wake Disordersdrug therapy', 'Triazolamtherapeutic use']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8524969/	['Benzodiazepine', 'Triazolam']	[134664, 5556]	8524969	['1995', 'Aug']
Simultaneous modeling of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam and diazepam.	DOI: 10.1016/0009-9236(95)90070-5	"The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam and diazepam were compared after intravenous infusions of 0.03 and 0.07 mg/kg midazolam and 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg diazepam on four separate occasions in 12 healthy male subjects in a randomized four-way crossover design. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) was used as a measure of drug effect. Subjects performed three practice tests before dosing to account for any effects caused by familiarization (""learning curve"") with the testing procedure. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were simultaneously fitted to a semiparametric model. In this model, a pharmacokinetic model related dose to plasma concentrations, a link model related plasma concentrations to the concentration at the effect site, and a pharmacodynamic model related the effect site concentration to the observed effect. The plasma-effect site equilibrium half-life was approximately 2 1/2 times longer for midazolam than for diazepam, which is in good agreement with previously published data. Based on the estimated effect site concentration at which half of the maximal effect was reached, midazolam had approximately a sixfold greater intrinsic potency than diazepam. This difference in potency was also observed in a previous study that used transformed electroencephalographic (EEG) data to assess pharmacodynamic activity. The findings reported here with a clinically relevant pharmacodynamic marker (DSST) confirm the utility of surrogate drug effect measures such as EEG. This work also shows the feasibility of conducting pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic analysis during the drug development process."

Stimulatory effect of butoctamide hydrogen succinate on REM sleep in normal humans.	DOI: 10.1016/0278-5846(95)00020-v	1. The efficacy of butoctamide hydrogen succinate (BAHS) was compared with that of nitrazepam on the basis of the polysomnograms and the subjective assessments. 2. Twelve healthy male students were divided into three groups consisting of 4 subjects each with were administered BAHS 600 mg, nitrazepam 5 mg, and BAHS 600 mg + nitrazepam 5 mg, respectively. 3. Polygraphic recordings were made for 8 consecutive nights for each subject, and the polysomnograms were evaluated by computerized automatic analysis using the interval histogram method. 4. An inert placebo was administered on the first 3 nights and on the seventh and eighth nights, and the test article regimen was administered on the fourth, fifth and sixth nights. 5. The test articles and the placebo were administered orally at 22:30 hr, and the recording of polysomnograms was started at 23:00 hr and ended at 8:00 hr the next morning. 6. The subjects were requested to fill out the subjective assessment of sleep before falling asleep and after arising the next morning. 7. BAHS increased REM sleep and decreased stage 2 sleep significantly; however, it failed to affect stage 1, 3 or 4 sleep. 8. Nitrazepam increased significantly the total sleep time and stage 2 sleep but decreased significantly the stage 3 sleep and decreased slightly the stages 1, 4 and REM sleep. 9. The combined treatment with BAHS and nitrazepam did not alter the sleep parameters except for increasing the total sleep time. 10. No obvious changes were observed in the subjective assessments after administration of the drugs. 11. These findings suggest that BAHS results in a unique sleep pattern different from benzodiazepines, and that BAHS may be suitable for treating insomnia in elderly patients and those with drug abuse, manic-depressive illness or schizophrenia.

Acute effects of the anxiolytics suriclone and alprazolam on cognitive information processing utilizing topographic mapping of event-related brain potentials (P300) in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00192378	In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, acute effects of suriclone--a cyclopyrrolone derivative--were investigated by means of topographic mapping of event-related potentials (ERPs). Fifteen normal volunteers, aged 22-35 years, received randomized, oral single doses of placebo, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg suriclone and 1 mg alprazolam as a reference compound. ERPs were investigated in an auditory oddball paradigm before and 3 h after intake of each drug. In addition to 17 EEG leads, vertical and horizontal electro-oculograms (EOGs) were recorded. After EOG minimization and artifact identification, the peak latencies of the spatial average were determined by an automatic procedure. Compared to placebo, no significant effects of the low and middle doses of suriclone on N1 amplitude were observed; the highest dosage reduced N1 amplitude, as did 1 mg alprazolam to an even greater extent. While no consistent effects on P2 amplitude were observed after suriclone, alprazolam reduced P2 amplitude. P300 amplitude was reduced only after the highest dosage of suriclone, but much more so after alprazolam. P300 latency was not affected significantly by suriclone, but a marked prolongation of P300 latency was observed after 1 mg alprazolam. Concerning N1 and P2 effects, alprazolam, but not suriclone, may have an inhibitory influence on stimulus-induced cortical arousal. Concerning P300 effects, the used doses of suriclone were superior to 1 mg alprazolam, which seemed to have reduced cognitive information processing capacity and prolonged stimulus evaluation time. Self-rated well-being (adjective checklist) showed subtle beneficial effects after 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg, but marked sedative effects after both 0.4 mg suriclone and 1 mg alprazolam.

Effects of ZK 93,426, a beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor antagonist on night sleep pattern in healthy male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02245185	The beta-carboline ZK 93,426, a benzodiazepine-antagonist with weak inverse agonist activity, was administered intravenously to human volunteers at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg when they initially reached slow-wave sleep during their night's sleep. Eight subjects, subjected to half a night of sleep withdrawal, took part in the study, which was performed according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Sleep parameters as determined by electroencephalography, actometry (wrist actometer) and temperature (rectal thermometer) were monitored for the whole night. Vital functions (blood pressure and heart rate) as well as subjectively experienced effects via visual analogue scales were evaluated and blood samples for hormone plasma level estimation were taken before and after sleep. ZK 93,426 was well tolerated. Sleep parameters were reduced under the influence of the drug indicating a stimulant effect. Slow wave sleep (sleep stages 3 and 4) was significantly reduced in favour of light sleep stages 1 and 2 during the first 30 min after the administration of ZK 93,426 (P = 0.02). In keeping with these findings subjects exhibited a significantly (P < 0.02) elevated number and intensity of movements during the first 90 min after the beta-carboline injection. Effects on self-ratings, in body temperature and on hormonal changes were not found. It is assumed that the benzodiazepine-antagonist ZK 93,426 is able to induce activation and disturb sleep via modulation of GABAergic transmission mainly by benzodiazepine receptor blocking properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Arousaldrug effects', 'Blood Pressuredrug effects', 'Body Temperaturedrug effects', 'Carbolinespharmacology', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'GABA-A Receptor Antagonists', 'Heart Ratedrug effects', 'Hormonesblood', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polysomnography', 'Sleepdrug effects']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7753965/	['Benzodiazepine', 'ZK-93426', 'PYRIDINE']	[134664, 115210, 1049]	7753965	['1995', 'Jan']
Pharmacopsychological effects of oxazepam and kava-extract in a visual search paradigm assessed with event-related potentials.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2007-1014309	The effects of oxazepam and a standardized extract of kava-roots (WS1490, W. Schwabe, Karlsruhe) on reaction time and event-related potentials (ERPs) were investigated in a visual search paradigm using a double-blind design in young, healthy males. Significant effects of oxazepam were obtained in a number of psychometric tests as well as search time and quality. Several ERP components of different latency, topography and functional significance were affected by the medications. Oxazepam led to a reduction of the amplitude of the parietal N1, frontal N2, posterior contralateral N2, and occipital P3 components. WS 1490 was associated with a greater posterior N1, posterior contralateral N2, and occipital P3. The effects are discussed in the light of the functional properties of the components and provide clues as to the psychological site of action of the drugs.

Sedative, memory, and performance effects of hypnotics.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02245054	The sedative, amnestic, and performance disruptive effects of benzodiazepine (Bz) receptor selective and non-selective hypnotics were studied in 23 healthy, normal subjects, aged 26.8 +/- 1.0 years. Triazolam (0.25 and 0.50 mg), zolpidem (10 and 20 mg) and placebo were administered, double-blind, at bedtime in a repeated measures design. During an awakening 90 min later (at approximate peak concentration of each drug) a 30-min performance battery which included memory, vigilance, and psychomotor tasks was completed. Each drug and dose impaired memory (both immediate and delayed), vigilance, and psychomotor performance relative to placebo. Among active drugs impairment was greatest with zolpidem 20 mg, next triazolam 0.50 mg, then zolpidem 10 mg, and finally triazolam 0.25 mg. Next morning delayed recall was also impaired by all drugs and doses (i.e. anterograde amnesia). The amnestic and performance-disruptive effects paralleled the relative hypnotic effects of the drugs and doses. No receptor selectivity in these pharmacodynamic effects was observed.

Central effects of the diuretic, bendrofluazide.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1994.tb04349.x	1. Central effects of the diuretic, bendrofluazide (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) were studied in 12 healthy volunteers. Two placebos and an active control drug, oxazepam (15 mg), were included. Single doses were administered double-blind at 10.00 h. The effects of drugs on performance and subjective feelings were assessed before and from 1.5-2.5 and 3.5-4.5 h after ingestion, and recording of the electrical activity of the brain (EEG) and body sway carried out. 2. Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, together with critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. Subjects assessed their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analogue scales. The EEG was recorded with eyes open while the subjects carried out a mental arithmetic task, and with eyes closed, when they were required to relax. Body sway was recorded with eyes open and with eyes closed. 3. Bendrofluazide (10 mg) increased the number of errors at letter cancellation and reduced the rate of finger tapping (P < 0.05), while oxazepam increased the number of errors and reduced accuracy at continuous attention (P < 0.01), and increased the number of involuntary rest pauses during tapping (P < 0.05). 4. There were no effects of drugs on subjective assessment of mood. 5. No changes in the electrical activity of the brain were observed with bendrofluazide. In recordings with eyes open, oxazepam reduced delta (0.5-3 Hz), theta (3.5-7 Hz) and alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz) while increasing beta 1 (13.5-21 Hz) activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Bendroflumethiazideadministration & dosageadverse effectsblood', 'Central Nervous Systemdrug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oxazepampharmacology', 'Psychomotor Performancedrug effects']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7826827/	['Benzodiazepine', 'Sulfonamides', 'Bendroflumethiazide']	[134664, 91392493, 2315]	7826827	['1994', 'Sep']
Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of electroencephalographic effects of midazolam in eight Chinese men.		The effects of midazolam (Mid) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) were related to Mid concentrations in serum in 8 Chinese healthy male volunteers for the assessment of concentration-effect relationship. The total number of waves per second within the frequency range of 12-30 Hz (TNW12-30) in the central-occipital (C1-O1) lead EEG obtained by aperiodic analysis was used as EEG effect of the drug. The PK-PD parameters were calculated by PK-PD software using the sigmoid Emax model. They were: T1(2)keo = 1.3 +/- 0.9 min-1, EC50 = 254 +/- 54 micrograms.L-1, N = 2.9 +/- 0.6. E0 and Emax were calculated from the observed values, being 3.4 +/- 1.3 and 11.4 +/- 2.2 TNW12-30, respectively. Our results showed that the concentration-EEG effect relationship of Mid could be characterized in individual Chinese man using TNW12-30 as a measure of pharmacological response.

A placebo-controlled evaluation of single, escalating doses of CL 284,846, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic.	DOI: 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1994.tb02002.x	This report describes the first evaluation in humans of CL 284,846, a non-benzodiazepine compound with a preclinical profile indicative of sedative/hypnotic properties. Healthy, normal male volunteers were assigned randomly to receive single oral doses of 1, 5, 15, 30, or 60 mg of CL 284,846 or placebo on a double-blind basis. Observations were made over the subsequent 25 hours to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and psychometric effects of the test compound. CL 284,846 was well tolerated in the normal volunteers, causing no significant changes in vital signs, EEG, ECG, hematologic, or clinical chemistry laboratory parameters. Although few adverse events were noted at doses less than 60 mg, at the highest dose (60 mg), all volunteers reported transient neurologically related adverse events (e.g., impaired concentration, difficulty focusing, and impaired coordination), reflecting the central nervous system action of the compound. Although determination of hypnotic efficacy was not an objective in this Phase I study, daytime treatment with 60 mg of CL 284,846 was associated with greater reports of drowsiness and impaired performance on psychomotor tests. However, memory, as assessed by a word recall test, was not affected at any dose of the compound. Pharmacokinetic analyses revealed CL 284,846 to be absorbed and eliminated rapidly (Tmax = 0.9-1.5 hr, T 1/2 = 0.9-1.1 hr), with a dose-proportional AUC (area under cure). Plasma levels of CL 284,859, the primary desethylated metabolite of CL 284,846, were much lower in humans than in other species, indicating that the metabolism of CL 284,846 in humans may differ from that of rodents and dogs. Overall, CL 284,846 was well tolerated, and the authors recommend repeating dose safety and pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers.

Sleep in a sitting position: effect of triazolam on sleep stages and EEG power spectra.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02244838	The effect of triazolam (0.25 mg) and placebo was investigated in healthy, male subjects who slept in a sitting position. After the intake of placebo, sleep efficiency, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and subjective sleep quality were lower than in the preceding sleep episode in bed, while stage 1 and REM sleep latency were higher. Triazolam did not prevent this impairment of sleep. However, in comparison with the placebo condition, the percentage of slow wave sleep was higher in the first third of the night, and in the morning sleep was rated as more quite. EEG power density in nonREM sleep was reduced in the frequency range of 1.25-10.0 Hz and enhanced in the range of sleep spindles (12.25-13.0 Hz). These changes were still present in the last third of the night. In REM sleep, triazolam reduced spectral activity in some frequency bins between 4.25 and 10.0 Hz. The sitting position itself affected the nonREM sleep spectra, since the placebo level in the 2.25-21.0-Hz range exceeded the baseline level. We conclude that a 0.25 mg dose of triazolam does not effectively counteract a posture-induced sleep disturbance, but induces changes in the EEG spectra which are typical for benzodiazepine receptor agonists.

Pharmaco-EEG mapping of diazepam effects using different references and absolute and relative power.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2007-1014363	The effects of diazepam on the EEG were studied by means of EEG topographic mapping, using recordings with four different references. Subjects were ten healthy, right-handed, male volunteers aged 21-25 years. Double-blind crossover trials with a single oral dose of 10 mg diazepam and placebo controls were conducted in random sequence at intervals of one week. Four referential derivations--ipsilateral earlobe (A1A2), average reference (AV), source derivation (SD), and balanced noncephalic electrode (BNE)--were used. One-minute vigilance-controlled EEGs before drug administration and two hours after drug administration were analyzed using Fourier transformation; absolute power and relative power were calculated for four frequency bands. Diazepam caused a widespread increase of beta-frequency relative power, and a widespread decrease of theta-frequency absolute power when A1A2 and SD were taken as references. From the comparison of different reference electrodes we conclude that the selection of the reference and of spectral parameters (absolute power or relative power) play an important role in pharmaco-EEG studies.

The concentration-time data was fitted with biexponential curve. Pharmacokinetic parameters were: T1/2 alpha = 6.8 +2- 2.5 min, T1/2 beta = 118 +/- 27 min, Vc = 25 +/- 7 L, Cl = 393 +/- 79 ml.min-1, Vdss = 59 +/- 13 L, AUC0-infinity = 39.6 +/- 8.6 g.min.L-1. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a decrease in alpha activity and an increase in beta activity. The EEG pattern reverted toward baseline after 2-3 h.

A comparison of the concentration-effect relationships of midazolam for EEG-derived parameters and saccadic peak velocity.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1993.tb04205.x	1. Concentration-effect relationships of midazolam were assessed in an open study in six healthy volunteers. Saccadic eye movements and EEG parameters derived by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and aperiodic analysis (AP) were used to quantify drug effects. 2. Midazolam was infused at a rate of 0.6 mg kg-1 h-1 for a maximum of 15 min. Hypnotic effects were avoided by terminating infusions when subjects could no longer perform the eye movement test properly. 3. Wake-sleep transitions could be recognized through frequent observation of eye movements. The dose needed to reach maximum conscious sedation averaged 0.10 mg kg-1, ranging from 0.06 to 0.13 mg kg-1. 4. Sigmoidal concentration-effect relationships were found for EEG beta-amplitudes in five of six subjects, with average EC50 values (+/- s.d.) of 120 +/- 54 ng ml-1 for FFT and 104 +/- 40 ng ml-1 for AP. For the 'total number of waves' in the beta frequency range (AP) an average (n = 6) EC50 of 63 +/- 37 ng ml-1 was found. Changes in EEG alpha-amplitudes were found in three subjects, resulting in an average EC50 value of 55 +/- 32 ng ml-1. 5. For saccadic peak velocity (PV) concentration-effect relationships were linear in five subjects and sigmoidal in one. The maximal measured decrease in PV averaged -44 +/- 9%. 6. The differences in concentration-effect relationships for various effect parameters call for further studies with emphasis on the external validity and reproducibility of data. In such studies the dose needed to reach wake-sleep transition may be used as a relevant clinical end-point.

Sedative doses of propofol increase beta activity of the processed electroencephalogram.	DOI: 10.1213/00000539-199305000-00010	The effects of sedative infusions of propofol on the processed electroencephalograms (EEG) of eight healthy male volunteers were studied. EEG data for aperiodic analysis were collected during three 5-min periods: before propofol, during propofol infusion, and 30 min after termination of the infusion. After an initial dose of 1 mg/kg, subjects received a propofol infusion titrated to produce a standard level of conscious sedation. The infusion rate was 84 +/- 27 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1 (mean +/- SE) and plasma propofol levels were 2180 +/- 43 ng/mL. Total EEG power, defined as the sum of the squares of peak-to-peak amplitudes during each 5-s epoch, increased from 1350 +/- 295 microV2 x epoch-1 to 9675 +/- 2390 microV2 x epoch-1 during the propofol infusion (P < 0.05); it returned to 1445 +/- 145 microV2 x epoch-1 30 min after the infusion was discontinued (P < 0.05 vs the result during propofol). The change in total power was accompanied by a change in the distribution of power within the EEG spectrum, as the fraction of activity in the beta-band (12-35 Hz) increased during the infusion from 23% +/- 3% to 44% +/- 5% (P < 0.05). Thirty minutes after the infusion was terminated, the distribution of activity within the EEG spectrum had reverted to pre-propofol patterns. The similarity of EEG effects seen with sedative doses of propofol and benzodiazepines suggests that these drugs may share some neurochemical effects.

Effects of oxazepam and an extract of kava roots (Piper methysticum) on event-related potentials in a word recognition task.	DOI: 10.1159/000118952	Twelve healthy volunteers were tested in a double-blind crossover study to assess the effects of oxazepam and an extract of kava roots (Piper methysticum) on behavior and event-related potentials (ERPs) in a recognition memory task. The subjects' task was to identify within a list of visually presented words those that were shown for the first time and those that were being repeated. The repeated words were associated with an increased positivity beginning approximately 250 ms poststimulus. Oxazepam led to a reduction of a negative component in the 250-500 ms range for both old and new words and to a reduction of the old/new difference in the ERP associated with a significantly worse recognition rate. Kava on the other hand showed a slightly increased recognition rate and a larger ERP difference between old and new words.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral diazepam: effect of dose, plasma concentration, and time.	DOI: 10.1038/clpt.1992.123	Eleven healthy subjects received single oral doses of placebo, 2 mg diazepam, 5 mg diazepam, and 10 mg diazepam in a randomized four-way crossover study. Plasma diazepam levels, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and fraction of total electroencephalographic (EEG) amplitude falling in the sigma plus beta (13 to 31 Hz) frequency range were determined during the 12 hours after drug administration. Peak plasma diazepam concentration and area under the 12-hour curve were proportional to dose; time of peak was independent of dose. Baseline percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range averaged 15.7% and did not differ among the four trials. The percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range did not change over baseline with placebo or 2 mg diazepam but was increased 1/4 to 2 1/2 hours after 5 mg diazepam, (maximum, +7.3%) and 3/4 to 12 hours after 10 mg diazepam (maximum, +15.2%). The increase in the percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range was highly correlated with plasma diazepam concentration. DSST scores for placebo and 2 mg diazepam were nearly identical. DSST decrements with 5 and 10 mg diazepam paralleled and were correlated with the changes in the percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range and with plasma diazepam levels. Thus the EEG analysis provides objective quantitation of benzodiazepine central nervous system effects, in turn reflecting plasma levels and other clinical measures.

EEG and auditory evoked potential P300 compared with psychometric tests in assessing vigilance after benzodiazepine sedation and antagonism.	DOI: 10.1093/bja/69.1.75	We have compared the EEG and auditory evoked wave P300 with psychometric tests in assessing vigilance after flumazenil antagonism of midazolam sedation in 12 healthy volunteers. Measurements were made before and after midazolam 0.1 and 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v., and immediately and 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after administration of flumazenil 1 mg. The sedative effects of midazolam and antagonism by flumazenil resulted in alterations in EEG, P300 and psychometric tests (syndrome short test, letter cancellation, choice reaction and recognition). However, 60 and 120 min after flumazenil a decrease in test performance indicating rebound sedation was seen only in P300 mapping. Thus P300 mapping was a sensitive method of detecting subtle differences in vigilance. Rebound sedation occurred even when midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1 was antagonized with an adequate dose of flumazenil.

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of the central nervous system effects of midazolam and its main metabolite alpha-hydroxymidazolam in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1038/clpt.1992.84	The pharmacodynamics of midazolam and its main metabolite alpha-hydroxymidazolam were characterized in individual subjects by use of saccadic eye movement and electroencephalographic (EEG) effect measurements. Eight healthy volunteers received 0.1 mg/kg midazolam intravenously in 15 minutes, 0.15 mg/kg alpha-hydroxymidazolam intravenously in 15 minutes, 7.5 mg midazolam orally and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover experiment. Plasma concentrations of midazolam, alpha-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam were measured by gas chromatography. The amplitudes in the 11.5 to 30 Hz (beta) frequency band were used as EEG effect measure. The concentration-effect relationships were quantified by the sigmoid maximum effect model. The median effective concentrations of midazolam and alpha-hydroxymidazolam were (mean +/- SE) 77 +/- 15 and 98 +/- 17 ng/ml, respectively, for the EEG effect measure. For peak saccadic velocity the values were 40 +/- 7 ng/ml for midazolam and 49 +/- 10 ng/ml for alpha-hydroxymidazolam. The maximum effect values were similar for both compounds. The effects observed after oral administration of midazolam could not be predicted accurately by an additive and competitive interaction model. It seems that alpha-hydroxymidazolam is highly potent with respect to the measured effects and contributes significantly to those effects of midazolam after oral administration.

Residual effects of repeated administration of triazolam and nitrazepam in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1159/000118823	The residual effects of hypnotics were investigated with a long-acting (nitrazepam) and a short-acting (triazolam) benzodiazepine hypnotic in 8 male volunteers. Subjects received placebo, nitrazepam 5 mg, or triazolam 0.25 mg for 7 consecutive nights in a random-order, double-blind crossover design. Daytime sleepiness, psychomotor performance, EEG activity and standing steadiness were assessed in the morning after 1, 4, and 7 days of drug treatment. Plasma concentrations of nitrazepam and triazolam were also assayed. The concentration of nitrazepam increased gradually during the course of treatment and was associated with residual sedative effects on days 4 and 7. Nitrazepam produced no apparent psychomotor impairments in these studies. On the other hand, there was no evidence of drug accumulation after triazolam administration and triazolam showed no residual sedative effects or residual impairment of psychomotor performance during the experiment. Thus, short-acting hypnotics may have an advantage over long-acting hypnotics in terms of producing less residual sedative effects during chronic treatment.

Rebound insomnia: duration of use and individual differences.		This study assessed consistency, duration of use, and individual difference in rebound insomnia. Eleven healthy men, 20-30 years old, with normal sleep by both subjective and polysomnographic criteria, received each of four treatments in a double-blind Latin Square design (triazolam 0.50 mg for 1, 6, and 12 nights and placebo for 12 nights), followed by two placebo discontinuation nights. Triazolam increased sleep compared with placebo without differences in effects between the first and last nights of treatment. On discontinuation following active drug, sleep efficiency was reduced compared with placebo, but duration of administration did not alter the likelihood or intensity of rebound insomnia. Those subjects (5) showing poorer sleep on discontinuation from the 12-night treatment also had poorer sleep in the 1- and 6-night treatment. Subjects with rebound insomnia had poorer baseline sleep and a greater drug effect than did subjects without.

The influence of dosage time of midazolam on its pharmacokinetics and effects in humans.	DOI: 10.1038/clpt.1991.99	The influence of dosage time of midazolam on its pharmacokinetics and effects on the central nervous system were investigated in six healthy volunteers, with pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. Each volunteer received single oral doses of 15 mg midazolam on four separate occasions: 8 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM, and 2 AM. An almost significant circadian variation was found in elimination half-life, shortest at 2 PM (1.26 +/- 0.47 hours, mean +/- SD) and longest at 2 AM (1.57 +/- 0.44 hours) (p = 0.05). Drug effects measured were alpha activity of the electroencepalograph and P100 latency of the visual-evoked response. The maximum drug effect (Emax) model described the concentration-effect relationship, extended with either a threshold drug concentration or a sigmoidicity parameter. A significant circadian variation was found in baseline alpha activity: highest at 8 AM (109% +/- 19% of the 24-hour mean) and lowest at 2 AM (80% +/- 12%). For alpha activity the drug concentration at half-maximum effect of both threshold Emax model and sigmoid Emax model showed lower values at 8 AM and 2 AM and higher values at 2 PM and 8 PM. However, these differences were either not significant (p = 0.10, threshold model) or on the verge of statistical significance (p = 0.05, sigmoid model). No circadian variation was found in the parameters describing the effect on the visual-evoked response. We conclude that the sensitivity of the central nervous system to midazolam, as reflected in alpha activity, possibly shows a circadian variation.

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling of the interaction between flumazenil and midazolam in volunteers by aperiodic EEG analysis.	DOI: 10.2165/00003088-199120060-00006	The CNS effects resulting from the combined administration of midazolam and flumazenil were studied in 8 healthy volunteers to develop a model of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interaction. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded between Fp1-M1 and Fp2-M2. The EEG parameter total number of waves between 12 and 30 Hz (TNW12-30) derived by aperiodic analysis was used to quantify the effect. Following a 15 min baseline EEG recording, infusion of placebo or flumazenil was started. Infusion regimens for flumazenil were designed so that 'steady-state' concentrations of 10 and 20 micrograms/L were obtained. Doses of midazolam 15, 30 and 60 mg over 5 min were given 30 min after the start of placebo infusion (session A) or flumazenil infusion to 10 micrograms/L (session B) or 20 micrograms/L (session C), respectively. Venous blood samples were taken until 8 h after the start of the flumazenil or placebo infusion. A sigmoid maximum effect (Emax) model was used to characterise the relationship between the plasma concentration of midazolam which is in equilibrium with the effect compartment concentration (Cem) [Cem/Kp] and TNW12-30. Within 2 to 5 min of starting the midazolam infusion all subjects fell asleep, with loss of eyelid reflex. They awoke between 25 and 82 min later in all 3 sessions. The mean (+/- SD) plasma drug concentrations of midazolam corresponding to half the maximum increase in TNW12-30 (EC50) were 276 +/- 64, 624 +/- 187 and 1086 +/- 379 micrograms/L in sessions A, B and C, respectively. The half-lives reflecting equilibration between plasma concentration and effect (t1/2ke0), estimated by a nonparametric method, were 2.2 +/- 1.2, 3.3 +/- 3.3 and 2.9 +/- 1.2 min for the 3 different sessions. Emax and N were not affected by flumazenil. In each subject the plot of the average measured steady-state plasma flumazenil concentration versus the EC50 of midazolam showed a linear relationship. The plasma concentration of flumazenil that doubled the EC50 of midazolam (Cf,2) was 6.5 +/- 1.0 micrograms/L. The observed interaction is consistent with the competitive nature of the antagonism of midazolam by flumazenil.

Analgesic potency of a new anticonvulsant drug versus acetylsalicylic acid via laser somatosensory evoked potentials. Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind (5-way) crossover study.		"A randomized, double-blind crossover study was performed with three different acute oral dosages of CM 40907 (3-(4-hydroxypiperidyl)-6-(2'-chlorophenyl)-pyridazine) (600, 900 and 1200 mg), a newly developed anticonvulsant drug, vs acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 1000 mg) and placebo in 12 male healthy volunteers to check analgesic potency. Objective algesimetry was done by Laser Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (LSEP). Subjective pain intensities were measured by retrospective visual analog scale ratings (VAS). Effects on objective vigilance were checked by Auditory Evoked Potentials (AEP). For both types of evoked potentials there was a simultaneous control of alterations in vigilance by means of the adaptive pursuit tracking task (APTT). A vigilance-controlled EEG (V-EEG) and a resting (R-EEG), visual analog scales (VAS) on sedation, excitation and anxiety as well as vital parameters (blood pressure and heart rate under supine and upright conditions) and adverse event scales were included in this trial as well. CM 40907 showed distinct analgesic effects on objective and subjective algesimetric parameters, which for the highest dosage (1200 mg) were superior in (""central"") P2-amplitude suppression of LSEPs to those of ASA in (""peripheral"") N1-amplitudes suppression and ongoing for more than 6 h. Subjective sedation was decreased, however, AEP-findings indicated a decreased vigilance after CM 40907.

Effect of zolpidem on sleep and sleep EEG spectra in healthy young men.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02244546	A single 10 mg dose of zolpidem, an imidazopyridine hypnotic, was administered to young, healthy male volunteers prior to bedtime. The drug reduced REM sleep but did not significantly affect other sleep stages and subjective sleep parameters. All-night spectral analysis of the EEG revealed that power density in nonREM sleep was reduced in the low-frequency range (1.25-2.5 Hz; 5.25-10.0 Hz) and increased in the spindle frequency range (12.25-13.0 Hz). Significant changes in the EEG spectrum were present in the first 4 h of sleep. The pattern of the spectral changes was similar to those induced by other hypnotics that bind to the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. There were no residual effects of zolpidem on psychomotor performance in the morning, on the self-rated state in the morning and at noon, and on sleep and EEG parameters in the subsequent drug-free night.

Central effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril. II. Electroencephalogram and body sway.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1990.tb03811.x	1. Effects of single doses of captopril (12.5, 25 and 50 mg) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and on body sway were studied in fourteen healthy male subjects. Oxazepam (15 mg), as an active control, and two placebos were included in the study, together with a single dose of atenolol (100 mg). Medication was administered double-blind at 11.00 h, and assessments made before and at 2 and 4 h after drug ingestion. 2. There were no changes in the EEG with captopril. Oxazepam reduced the circadian rise in alpha activity, while atenolol decreased beta power. Delta activity was modified by both oxazepam and atenolol. 3. A reduction in lower frequencies of body sway (0.05-1 Hz) occurred with captopril, while the spectra were unaffected by oxazepam. Atenolol increased (P less than 0.05) activity in the frequency range 0.75-2.75 Hz. 4. These observations suggest that captopril is free of central effects such as sedation that may occur with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Reduced body sway with captopril could reflect improved integration of central and peripheral control of posture.

Sleep, performance, and plasma levels in chronic insomniacs during 14-day use of flurazepam and midazolam: methodology.	DOI: 10.1097/00004714-199008001-00003	Methods are described for a five-center study of flurazepam and midazolam, in which 107 patients with histories of benzodiazepine use for chronic insomnia were enrolled. Data were available for 99 of these patients. Staff and patient manuals and a behavior-based computer system were specially designed to measure and delineate clearly the study procedures and parameters. Patients were carefully followed and supported during a 20-day washout period and underwent extensive training on psychomotor performance tasks. They received placebo for 2 nights and were then randomly assigned to one of four study treatments--flurazepam 15 or 30 mg, midazolam 15 mg, or placebo--for 14 consecutive nights. All-night sleep electroencephalographic recordings were obtained on study nights--1 and 0 (placebo) and 1, 2, 7, 13, and 14 (treatment nights). Results of four computer-generated psychomotor performance tasks and three cognitive tasks, plus subjective evaluations of sleep, performance, and mood, were recorded in the morning after each night spent in the sleep laboratory. Blood and urine samples were analyzed for drug concentrations in plasma and for compliance with the protocol.

Quantification of the EEG effect of midazolam by aperiodic analysis in volunteers. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling.	DOI: 10.2165/00003088-199018030-00006	The effects of midazolam on the EEG were related to plasma midazolam concentrations in 8 healthy male volunteers in order to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. The EEG parameters were derived by aperiodic analysis. The EEG was recorded between Fp1-M1 and Fp2-M2. Following a 15-minute baseline EEG registration, midazolam 15 mg was given intravenously over 5 minutes. Venous blood samples were taken until 8 hours after the start of the infusion. Within 2 to 4 minutes of starting the infusion all subjects became asleep, with loss of eyelid reflex. The most obvious EEG changes, in the beta frequency range (12 to 30 Hz), were observed within 2 minutes of the start of drug administration. Seven subjects awoke 60 to 70 minutes after the start of the infusion and 1 awoke after 45 minutes. The EEG parameter that best characterised the effect of midazolam was the total number of waves per second in the frequency range 12 to 30 Hz (TNW12-30). This was used as the effect parameter in the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling. The plasma concentration-time data were characterised by a triexponential function for all subjects. To allow for a possible delay between plasma midazolam concentration and EEG effect, a hypothetical effect compartment was included in the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. A sigmoid maximum effect (Emax) model was used to characterise the effect compartment midazolam concentration-TNW12-30 data.

High-Dose Prednisolone for Treatment of Infantile Spasms After Presumed Perinatal Stroke.	DOI: 10.1097/JNN.0000000000000571	BACKGROUND: High-dose prednisone and prednisolone have been increasingly studied as a lower-cost alternative to adrenocorticotropic hormone for the treatment of infantile spasms, but this treatment has not been well studied in children with infantile spasms due to perinatal stroke. METHODS: We identified a girl with new-onset infantile spasms due to presumed perinatal left middle cerebral artery stroke seen in our hospital's pediatric stroke clinic in 2019. RESULTS: This girl developed infantile spasms at 9 months old. She had right hemiplegic cerebral palsy due to her perinatal stroke but had been otherwise previously healthy. Modified hypsarrhythmia was confirmed on prolonged video-electroencephalography. High-dose prednisolone at 8 mg/kg per day was initiated on the sixth day of spasms. She was treated with this dose for 2 weeks and then tapered over 5 weeks. The girl became seizure-free after receiving her first dose of prednisolone and experienced no significant adverse effects during therapy. Routine electroencephalography after completion of prednisolone taper confirmed resolution of modified hypsarrhythmia and no epileptiform discharges. She continued to make excellent development progress during and after treatment. CONCLUSION: This case suggests high-dose prednisolone could be considered for first-line therapy for children with infantile spasms due to perinatal stroke; further study is needed.

Disparate effects of hormones and vigabatrin on sleep slow waves in patients with West syndrome - An indication of their mode of action?	DOI: 10.1111/jsr.13137	Synaptic downscaling during sleep, a physiological process to restore synaptic homeostasis and maintain learning efficiency and healthy brain development, has been related to a reduction of the slope of sleep slow waves (SSW). However, such synaptic downscaling seems not to be reflected in high-amplitude SSW. Recently we have shown reduced SSW slopes during hormonal treatment (adrenocorticotrophic hormone, prednisolone) in patients with West syndrome (WS). Yet, whether this reduction was related to successful treatment or reflects a specific effect of hormone therapy is unknown. Thus, we retrospectively analysed nap electroencephalograms of 61 patients with WS successfully treated with hormones, vigabatrin (VGB), or both. The slope of SSW during treatment (T1) and 2-7 months later (T2) when hormonal treatment was tapered off were compared between the treatment groups and healthy, age-matched controls. At T1 hormone treatment reduced the slope of low-amplitude SSW, whereas VGB increased the slope of high-amplitude SSW (linear mixed effect model: FGroup  = 7.04, p < 0.001; FAmplitude  = 1,646.68, p < 0.001; FGroup*Amplitude  = 3.38, p < 0.001). At T2, untreated patients did not differ anymore from healthy controls, whereas those still under VGB showed the same alterations as those with VGB at T1. This result indicates a disparate effect of VGB and hormone on the SSW slope. In particular, hormones seem to reduce the slope of cortical generated low-amplitude SSW, similar to the physiological synaptic downscaling during sleep. Thus, a loss of functional neuronal connectivity might be an alternative explanation of the antiepileptic effect of hormonal treatment.

Depression-like changes of the sleep-EEG during high dose corticosteroid treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis.	DOI: 10.1016/s0306-4530(02)00085-9	Acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis (MS) are commonly treated with high doses of corticosteroids that can influence sleep regulation and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity. We examined the sleep-EEG (including conventional and spectral EEG analysis) in 9 female patients with relapsing-remitting MS (and no psychiatric disorder) just prior to and on days 2 and 10 of high dose corticosteroid treatment (500 mg/day methylprednisolone given IV for 5 days, then PO taper down) and age-matched healthy female controls. Before treatment with corticosteroids, MS patients compared to controls showed few changes of the sleep EEG, namely a significant increase in slow wave sleep (SWS) and a decrease in stage 2 sleep. In contrast, on day 10, but not day 2 of treatment, MS patients showed a number of sleep-EEG changes typically observed in patients with depression, including a reduction in REM latency, an increase in REM density, a decrease in the SWS and delta sleep ratio and a decrease in sigma EEG activity. However, no concomitant effect of treatment on mood was noted. In summary, unlike acute treatment with methylprednisolone, prolonged treatment induces several changes of the sleep-EEG in MS patients, that are also observed in patients with an acute depressive episode. Further prospective studies with longer-term follow-up are needed to examine the clinical relevance of our preliminary data.

Quantitative EEG in long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	DOI: 10.1016/s0887-8994(96)00232-9	Conventional and quantitative aspects of electroencephalographic recordings obtained during a follow-up surveillance study in long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood were investigated with respect to differences in central nervous system prophylaxis given during antileukemic therapy and compared with data derived from healthy controls. Central nervous system prophylaxis consisted either of cranial irradiation (18 Gray, group A, n = 8) or intermediate high-dose methotrexate (2000 mg/m2; group B, n = 5), each combined with intrathecal methotrexate. Conventional electroencephalographic analysis revealed comparable results in all three study groups. However, quantitative electroencephalography showed significantly increased absolute power scores for all frequency bands in both long-term survivor groups. Relative power estimates revealed a significant increase in delta/tau activities in both prophylaxis groups compared to healthy controls, which were countered by decreased percentage power scores in the alpha-range. Quantitative electroencephalographic comparisons between both central nervous system prophylaxis groups revealed only small differences in quantity, not quality, of the observed power disturbances with slightly higher deviations in irradiated long-term survivors than in nonirradiated ones. Topographical distributions of spectral band power were comparable between all three study groups without evidence for therapy-related topographical differences.

Childhood leukemia survivors exhibit deficiencies in sensory and cognitive processes, as reflected by event-related brain potentials after completion of curative chemotherapy: A preliminary investigation.	DOI: 10.1080/13803395.2019.1623865	Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize post-chemotherapy sensory, memory, and attention abilities in childhood survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to better understand how treatment affects cognitive functioning. Methods: Eight ALL survivors and eight age-matched, healthy children between the ages of 5-11 years participated in the study. Among the ALL survivors, a median of 63 days (range 22-267 days) elapsed between completion of chemotherapy and this assessment. Sounds were presented in an oddball paradigm while recording the electroencephalogram in separate conditions of passive listening and active task performance. To assess different domains of cognition, we measured event-related brain potentials (ERPs) reflecting sensory processing (P1 component), working memory (mismatch negativity [MMN] component), attentional orienting (P3a), and target detection (P3b component) in response to the sounds. We also measured sound discrimination and response speed performance. Results: Relative to control subjects, ALL survivors had poorer performance on auditory tasks, as well as decreased amplitude of the P1, MMN, P3a, and P3b components. ALL survivors also did not exhibit the amplitude gain typically observed in the sensory P1 component when attending to the sound input compared to when passively listening. Conclusions: Atypical responses were observed in brain processes associated with sensory discrimination, auditory working memory, and attentional control in pediatric ALL survivors indicating deficiencies in all cognitive domains compared to age-matched controls. Significance: ERPs differentiated aspects of cognitive functioning, which may provide a useful tool for assessing recovery and risk of post-chemotherapy cognitive deficiencies in young children. The decreased MMN amplitude in ALL survivors may indicate (N-methyl D-aspartate) NMDA dysfunction induced by methotrexate, and thus provides a potential therapeutic target for chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairments.

Mir-29a expressions in peripheral blood mononuclear cell and cerebrospinal fluid: Diagnostic value in patients with pediatric tuberculous meningitis.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2017.01.013	To evaluate the value of miR-29a expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculous meningitis (TBM). Our study enrolled 112 children with TBM and 130 healthy children, from which PBMC and CSF were collected. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of miR-29a in PBMC and CSF, and then analyze the diagnostic value. Compared with control group, the miR-29a expressions in PBMC and CSF were increased in TBM children (both P<0.05), and the expressions were associated with following factors: intracranial hypertension, conscious disturbance, focal cerebral symptoms, meningeal irritation, hydrocrania, abnormal electroencephalogram and extra-cerebral tuberculous (all P<0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of miR-29a in PBMC was 67.20%, 88.50% and 0.852, respectively, and that in CSF was 81.10%, 90.00% and 0.890, respectively, and that in combination of PBMC and CSF was 84.40%, 95.38% and 0.934, respectively. miR-29a expression in PBMC and CSF may provide a reference for the diagnosis of pediatric TBM.

Bispectral Index values are higher during halothane vs. sevoflurane anesthesia in children, but not in infants.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1399-6576.2005.00813.x	Previously, we have shown in adult patients that bispectral index score (BIS) values are significantly higher during halothane anesthesia (53-61 units) as compared with those observed during equipotent concentrations of sevoflurane (39-43 units).

Quiescence during burst suppression and postictal generalized EEG suppression are distinct patterns of activity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.clinph.2022.07.493	Periods of low-amplitude electroencephalographic (EEG) signal (quiescence) are present during both anesthetic-induced burst suppression (BS) and postictal generalized electroencephalographic suppression (PGES). PGES following generalized seizures induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been previously linked to antidepressant response. The commonality of quiescence during both BS and PGES motivated trials to recapitulate the antidepressant effects of ECT using high doses of anesthetics. However, there have been no direct electrographic comparisons of these quiescent periods to address whether these are distinct entities.

Usability of the SedLine® electroencephalographic monitor of depth of anaesthesia in pigs: a pilot study.	DOI: 10.1007/s10877-022-00807-3	To investigate the usability of the SedLine® monitor in anaesthetized pigs. Five juvenile healthy pigs underwent balanced isoflurane-based general anaesthesia for surgical placement of a subcutaneous jugular venous port. The SedLine® was applied to continuously monitor electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and its modulation during anaesthesia. Computer tomography and magnetic resonance were performed to investigate the relationship between electrodes' positioning and anatomical structures. The pediatric SedLine® EEG-sensor could be easily applied and SedLine®-generated variables collected. An EEG Density Spectral Array (DS) was displayed over the whole procedure. During surgery, the EEG signal was dominated by elevated power in the delta range (0.5-4 Hz), with an underlying broadband signal (where power decreased with increasing frequency). The emergence period was marked by a decrease in delta power, and a more evenly distributed power over the 4-40 Hz frequency range. From incision to end of surgery, mean SedLine®-generated values (± standard deviation) were overall stable [23.0 (± 2.8) Patient State Index (PSI), 1.0% (± 3.8%) Suppression Ratio (SR), 8.8 Hz (± 2.5 Hz) Spectral Edge Frequency 95% (SEF) left, 7.7 Hz (± 2.4 Hz) SEF right], quickly changing during emergence [75.3 (± 11.1) PSI, 0.0 (± 0.0) SR, 12.5 (± 6.6) SEF left 10.4 (± 6.6) SEF right]. Based on the imaging performed, the sensor does not record EEG signals from the same brain areas as in humans. SedLine®-DSA and -generated variables seemed to reflect variations in depth of anaesthesia in pigs. Further studies are needed to investigate this correlation, as well as to define the species-specific brain structures monitored by the EEG-sensor.

Recovery of consciousness and cognition after general anesthesia in humans.	DOI: 10.7554/eLife.59525	Understanding how the brain recovers from unconsciousness can inform neurobiological theories of consciousness and guide clinical investigation. To address this question, we conducted a multicenter study of 60 healthy humans, half of whom received general anesthesia for 3 hr and half of whom served as awake controls. We administered a battery of neurocognitive tests and recorded electroencephalography to assess cortical dynamics. We hypothesized that recovery of consciousness and cognition is an extended process, with differential recovery of cognitive functions that would commence with return of responsiveness and end with return of executive function, mediated by prefrontal cortex. We found that, just prior to the recovery of consciousness, frontal-parietal dynamics returned to baseline. Consistent with our hypothesis, cognitive reconstitution after anesthesia evolved over time. Contrary to our hypothesis, executive function returned first. Early engagement of prefrontal cortex in recovery of consciousness and cognition is consistent with global neuronal workspace theory.

Neuromuscular block differentially affects immobility and cortical activation at near-minimum alveolar concentration anesthesia.

The effect of hypocapnia on the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow during administration of isoflurane.	DOI: 10.1213/01.ANE.0000148623.06596.7E	Isoflurane impairs autoregulation of cerebral blood flow in a dose-related manner. Previous investigations in several other conditions have demonstrated that impaired autoregulation can be restored by hyperventilation. We hypothesized that hypocapnia may restore cerebral autoregulation impaired by isoflurane anesthesia. We administered isoflurane in 100% oxygen to 12 healthy patients aged 21-59 yr scheduled for elective nonneurological surgery. Isoflurane end-tidal concentration was individualized at 0.1% to 0.2% less than that required to induce short periods of isoelectric electroencephalogram. This resulted in an end-tidal isoflurane concentration of 1.6% +/- 0.2% (mean +/- sd) corresponding to an age-adjusted minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration multiple of 1.4. Mean arterial blood pressure was reduced to <80 mm Hg, by infusion of remifentanil if required. Cerebral autoregulation was assessed by infusing phenylephrine to increase mean arterial blood pressure to 100 mm Hg while monitoring middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. The change in flow velocity was used to calculate the autoregulation index (ARI). The ARI ranges between 0 and 1 and an ARI < or =0.4 indicates significantly impaired autoregulation. Autoregulation was tested twice in randomized order: once during normocapnia (Paco(2) 38-43 mm Hg) and once during hypocapnia (Paco(2) 27-34 mm Hg). The median (interquartile range) ARI was 0.29 (0.23-0.64) during normocapnia and 0.77 (0.70-0.78) during hypocapnia (P < 0.005). Of the 12 subjects, autoregulation was significantly impaired in 8 subjects during normocapnia and none during hypocapnia (P = 0.001). Hypocapnia restored cerebral autoregulation in normal subjects during isoflurane-induced impairment of autoregulation.

The effect of cerebral monitoring on recovery after general anesthesia: a comparison of the auditory evoked potential and bispectral index devices with standard clinical practice.	DOI: 10.1213/01.ANE.0000087041.63034.8C	The use of cerebral monitoring may improve the ability of anesthesiologists to titrate anesthetic drugs. However, there is controversy regarding the impact of the alleged anesthetic-sparing effects of cerebral monitoring on the recovery process and patient outcome. We designed this prospective double-blinded, sham-controlled study to evaluate the impact of intraoperative monitoring with the electroencephalogram bispectral index (BIS) or auditory evoked potential (AEP) device on the usage of desflurane and the time to discharge from the recovery room, as well as on patient satisfaction with their anesthetic experience and recovery. Ninety healthy patients undergoing laparoscopic general surgery procedures using a standardized anesthetic technique were randomly assigned to one of three monitoring groups: standard clinical practice (control), BIS-guided, or AEP-guided. Both the BIS and AEP monitors were connected to all patients before induction of general anesthesia. In the control group, the anesthesiologists were not permitted to observe the BIS or AEP index values during the intraoperative period. In the BIS-guided group, the volatile anesthetic was titrated to maintain a BIS value in the range of 45-55. In the AEP-guided group, the targeted AEP index range was 15-20. The BIS and AEP indices, as well as end-tidal desflurane concentration, were recorded at 3-5 min intervals. Recovery times to awakening, tracheal extubation, fast-track score >or=12, and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge criteria were recorded at 1-10 min intervals. In addition, patient satisfaction with anesthesia and quality of recovery were evaluated on 100- and 18-point scales, respectively, at 24 h after surgery. The AEP- and BIS-guided groups were administered significantly smaller average end-tidal desflurane concentrations than the control group (3.8 +/- 0.9 and 3.9 +/- 0.6 versus 4.7 +/- 1.7, respectively) (P < 0.01). Although the emergence times to eye opening, tracheal extubation, and obeying commands were consistently shorter in the AEP and BIS groups (6 +/- 4 and 6 +/- 5 versus 8 +/- 8 min; 6 +/- 5 and 6 +/- 4 versus 11 +/- 10 min; and 8 +/- 4 and 7 +/- 4 versus 12 +/- 9 min, respectively), only the extubation times were significantly different from the control group (P < 0.05). More importantly, the length of the PACU stay was significantly shorter in both the AEP- and BIS-guided groups (79 +/- 43 and 80 +/- 47 versus 108 +/- 58 min, respectively) (P < 0.05). The patients' quality of recovery was also significantly higher in the two monitored groups (15 +/- 2 versus 13 +/- 3 in the control group, P < 0.05). We concluded that cerebral monitoring with either the BIS or AEP devices reduced the maintenance anesthetic (desflurane) requirement, resulting in a shorter length of stay in the PACU and improved quality of recovery after laparoscopic surgery. However, there were no significant outcome differences between the two cerebral monitored groups.

Modeling and closed-loop control of hypnosis by means of bispectral index (BIS) with isoflurane.	DOI: 10.1109/10.936364	A model-based closed-loop control system is presented to regulate hypnosis with the volatile anesthetic isoflurane. Hypnosis is assessed by means of the bispectral index (BIS), a processed parameter derived from the electroencephalogram. Isoflurane is administered through a closed-circuit respiratory system. The model for control was identified on a population of 20 healthy volunteers. It consists of three parts: a model for the respiratory system, a pharmacokinetic model and a pharmacodynamic model to predict BIS at the effect compartment. A cascaded internal model controller is employed. The master controller compares the actual BIS and the reference value set by the anesthesiologist and provides expired isoflurane concentration references to the slave controller. The slave controller maneuvers the fresh gas anesthetic concentration entering the respiratory system. The controller is designed to adapt to different respiratory conditions. Anti-windup measures protect against performance degradation in the event of saturation of the input signal. Fault detection schemes in the controller cope with BIS and expired concentration measurement artifacts. The results of clinical studies on humans are presented.

Auditory steady-state response, upper facial EMG, EEG and heart rate as predictors of movement during isoflurane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia.	DOI: 10.1093/bja/73.2.174	We have studied the relationship between patient movement and changes in the auditory steady-state evoked potential, upper facial muscle electromyogram (FEMG), electroencephalographic-zero crossing frequency (EEG-ZCF) and heart rate during emergence from anaesthesia. Twelve healthy patients underwent surgery during stable isoflurane-nitrous oxide-oxygen anaesthesia without neuromuscular block. After skin closure, anaesthesia was discontinued abruptly while mechanical ventilation was continued until the patient moved. The magnitude of change in each physiological signal was evaluated in decibels (dB). Both the auditory steady state evoked potential and FEMG showed significant increases in amplitude during the last 5-min period before movement (6.1 and 10.7 dB, respectively). EEG-ZCF increased rapidly after anaesthesia was discontinued (2.5 dB) but there was no further increase in activity before movement. Heart rate did not change before movement. The use of the decibel transformation offers a promising method of displaying and interpreting changes in physiological variables during anaesthesia.

The electroencephalographic effects of desflurane in humans.	DOI: 10.1097/00000542-199103000-00008	The electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of a new inhaled anesthetic are of interest because of the potential of such agents to produce excitatory (convulsant) activity and because of the potential usefulness of the EEG as an indicator of anesthetic depth and cerebral activity. Accordingly, we examined the EEG in 12 healthy, young male volunteers during desflurane anesthesia. Each subject had a baseline recording and then steady-state exposure to 6, 9, and 12% (0.83, 1.24, and 1.66 MAC) desflurane in O2 alone, and to 3, 6, and 9% desflurane in O2 with 60% N2O. The sequence of doses and the presence of N2O were randomized. We used mechanical ventilation to maintain normocapnia at each dose level. We also tested the effects of hypercapnia secondary to spontaneous ventilation. Additionally, at 1.24 MAC, subjects' lungs were hyperventilated to a PCO2 of 25.8 +/- 0.7 mmHg and exposed to rhythmic, loud clapping to attempt to provoke excitatory phenomena. Finally, after at least 6 h exposure to desflurane, we repeated measurements at 0.83 and 1.66 MAC to assess possible tolerance. Four channels of EEG were monitored visually, and at each dose, a quantitative EEG analysis was performed. Desflurane produced EEG changes comparable to those observed with equipotent levels of isoflurane. No epileptiform activity was seen. Desflurane significantly suppressed EEG activity; prominent burst suppression was seen at 1.24 MAC and higher. Substitution of N2O for 0.42 MAC desflurane reduced the degree of EEG suppression relative to the equipotent administration of desflurane and O2. Quantitative EEG measures for the early doses and for the later, repeated exposures did not differ.

Pindolol does not augment central serotonin function increases to citalopram in humans: an auditory evoked potential investigation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pbb.2006.07.013	Animal studies have demonstrated that the co-administration of pindolol and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) potentiate serotonergic functioning to a greater degree than SSRIs alone. However, clinical trials of pindolol augmentation in patients with major depressive disorder have reported contradictory findings, and the central effects of this treatment regime on serotonin functioning in humans are unknown. The current double-blind placebo controlled repeated measures investigation used the loudness dependence auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) to assess central serotonin functioning in healthy participants across three acute treatment conditions: placebo, citalopram (20 mg), and pindolol (10 mg)+citalopram (20 mg). The current paper focuses on the effects of pindolol augmentation of citalopram as compared to the administration of citalopram alone. Enhancement of serotonin function with citalopram in comparison to placebo decreased the slope of the LDAEP (i.e. weaker LDAEP). However, there were no significant differences between the changes in the LDAEP induced by co-administration of pindolol and citalopram compared to citalopram. The present results indicate that, in healthy controls, pindolol augmentation of SSRIs does not potentiate central serotonin function to a greater degree than the administration of an SSRI alone. The findings may provide further support for why pindolol may not be an effective therapeutic strategy to augment serotonin function and antidepressant response.

EEG effects of buspirone and pindolol: a method of examining 5-HT1A receptor function in humans.	DOI: 10.1007/s00213-002-1339-0	An involvement of 5-HT(1A) receptors is postulated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and mechanism of action of antidepressants. Methods for studying their functional integrity in humans are, however, limited. Preliminary data suggests that activation of somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptors cause a negative shift in the EEG frequency spectrum. Animal research suggests that pindolol is an agonist at these receptors but an antagonist at postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors.

The number of cysteine residues per mole in apolipoprotein E affects systematically synchronous neural interactions in women's healthy brains.	DOI: 10.1007/s00221-013-3464-x	Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is involved in lipid metabolism in the brain, but its effects on brain function are not understood. Three apoE isoforms (E4, E3, and E2) are the result of cysteine-arginine interchanges at two sites: there are zero interchanges in E4, one interchange in E3, and two interchanges in E2. The resulting six apoE genotypes (E4/4, E4/3, E4/2, E3/3, E3/2, E2/2) yield five groups with respect to the number of cysteine residues per mole (CysR/mole), as follows. ApoE4/4 has zero cysteine residues per mole (0-CysR/mole), E4/3 has one (1-CysR/mole), E4/2 and E3/3 each has two (2-CysR/mole), E3/2 has three (3-CysR/mole), and E2/2 has four (4-CysR/mole). The use of the number of CysR/mole to characterize the apoE molecule converts the categorical apoE genotype scale, consisting of 6 distinct genotypes above, to a 5-point continuous scale (0-4 CysR/mole). This allows the use of statistical analyses suitable for continuous variables (e.g. regression) to quantify the relations between various variables and apoE. Using such analyses, here, we show for the first time that apoE affects in a graded and orderly manner neural communication, as assessed by analyzing the relation between the number of CysR/mole and synchronous neural interactions (SNI) measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 130 cognitively healthy women. At the one end of the CysR/mole range, the 4-CysR/mole (E2/2) SNI distribution had the highest mean, lowest variance, lowest range, and lowest coefficient of variation, whereas at the other end, 0-CysR/mole (E4/4) SNI distribution had the lowest mean, highest variance, highest range, and highest coefficient of variation. The special status of the 4-CysR/mole distribution was reinforced by the results of a hierarchical tree analysis where the 4-CysR/mole (E2/2) SNI distribution occupied a separate branch by itself and the remaining CysR/mole SNI distributions were placed at increasing distances from the 4-CysR/mole distribution, according to their number of CysR/mole, with the 0-CysR/mole (E4/4) being farthest away. These findings suggest that the 4-CysR/mole (E2/2) SNI distribution could serve as a reference distribution. When the SNI distributions of individual women were expressed as distances from this reference distribution, there was a substantial overlap among women of various CysR/mole. This refocuses the placement of individual brains along a continuous distance from the 4-CysR/mole SNI distribution, in contrast to the common categorical assignment to a specific apoE genotype. Finally, the orderly variation of SNI with the number of CysR/mole found here is in keeping with recent advances and ideas regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential effects of apoE in the brain which emphasize the healthier stability conferred on the apoE molecule by the increasing number of cysteine-arginine interchanges, with 4-CysR/mole (E2/2) being the best case, as opposed to the instability and increased chance of toxic fragmentation of the apoE molecule with lower number of CysR/mole, with 0-CysR/mole (E4/4) as the worst case (Mahley and Huang in Neuron 76:871-885, 2012a). However, our results also document the appreciable variation of SNI properties within the various CysR/mole groups and individuals which points to the existence and important role of other factors involved in shaping brain function at the network level.

Improvement of sleep and pituitary-adrenal inhibition after subchronic intranasal vasopressin treatment in elderly humans.	DOI: 10.1097/00004714-200302000-00007	Subchronic intranasal treatment with argininevasopressin (AVP) has been shown to exert a strong ameliorating effect on sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) deficits in elderly. However, AVP is also a potent stimulus of the pituitary-adrenal stress system, which is usually inhibited during early, SWS-rich sleep. A disinhibition of pituitary-adrenal activity during sleep is correlated with aging and is considered a pathologic factor contributing to various age-related diseases. Here, we examined whether the beneficial effect of prolonged intranasal AVP administration on sleep in aged would be associated with a concomitant decrease in pituitary-adrenal inhibition and effects on other neuroendocrine features of sleep. Twenty-six healthy elderly (mean 72.9 yr) with mild sleep complaints were investigated in a placebo controlled double-blind study. One group was treated daily each morning and evening with intranasal AVP (2 x 20 IU) for 10 weeks, the other received placebo. During polysomnographical recordings taken at the beginning and end of the treatment period, blood was sampled every 15 min. Intranasal AVP increased SWS on average by +21.5 min (p<0.02). The effect persisted on the night after acute withdrawal of the peptide treatment with no rebound occurring. Notably, rather than increasing pituitary-adrenal activity, AVP decreased the early sleep cortisol nadir on average by 0.5 microg/dl (p<0.05). AVP did not induce any measurable changes in fluid balance or cardiovascular activity. Overall, results indicate a promoting effect of AVP on SWS in aged accompanied by a beneficial rather than impairing influence on the neuroendocrine pattern of sleep.

Brain potential changes after intranasal vs. intravenous administration of vasopressin: evidence for a direct nose-brain pathway for peptide effects in humans.	DOI: 10.1016/0006-3223(95)00180-8	There is evidence that intranasal application of peptides is a way to circumvent the blood-brain barrier. This led us to compare the effects of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) on event-related potentials (ERPs) in healthy men (n = 15) after intranasal and after intravenous (i.v.) administration. In a double-blind, crossover study, subjects received on three different occasions 20 IU of AVP intranasally (IN), 1.5 IU of AVP i.v., and saline solution. ERPs were recorded during the subject's performance on a auditory attention task. Plasma concentrations of vasopressin during task performance were enhanced after AVP, with the increase after i.v. administration of AVP exceeding that after AVP (p < 0.05). Intranasal administration of AVP substantially increased the P3 component of the ERP (p < 0.05). Intranasal administration of AVP substantially increased the P3 component of the ERP (< 0.01). By contrast, i.v. administration of AVP had no consistent effects on the ERP responses. In supplementary experiments as well, i.v. administration of lower doses of AVP (0.1 and 0.025 IU) did not affect the ERP. Plasma vasopressin concentrations after the 0.025 IU dose in these experiments were comparable to those after intranasal administration of 20 IU AVP. The results provide functional evidence that in the human brain effects of peptides like AVP may be facilitated after IN as compared to i.v. administration.

Neurophysiological and subjective profile of marijuana with varying concentrations of cannabinoids.	DOI: 10.1097/00008877-200509000-00023	This study investigated the contribution of different cannabinoids to the subjective, behavioral and neurophysiological effects of smoked marijuana. Healthy marijuana users (12 men, 11 women) participated in four sessions. They were randomly assigned to a low or a high delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol group (THC; 1.8% versus 3.6%). In the four sessions under blinded conditions subjects smoked marijuana cigarettes containing placebo (no active cannabinoids), or cigarettes containing THC with low or high levels of cannabichromene (CBC; 0.1% versus 0.5%) and low or high levels of cannabidiol (CBD; 0.2% versus 1.0%). Dependent measures included subjective reports, measures of cognitive task performance and neurophysiological measures [electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP)]. Compared to placebo, active THC cigarettes produced expected effects on mood, behavior and brain activity. A decrease in performance, reduction in EEG power and attenuation of ERP components reflecting attentional processes were observed during tests of working memory and episodic memory. Most of these effects were not dose-dependent. Varying the concentrations of CBC and CBD did not change subjects' responses on any of the outcome measures. These findings are consistent with previous studies indicating that THC and its metabolites are the primary active constituents of marijuana. They also suggest that neurophysiological EEG and ERP measures are useful biomarkers of the effects of THC.

Smoking induced changes in EEG two-dimensional maps and blood gas analysis.	DOI: 10.1007/BF01184782	The effects of smoking on mental function were investigated by the two-dimensional EEG mapping method, and the results were analyzed in conjunction with blood gas data that had been obtained simultaneously. Healthy medical students from the National Defense Medical College were used as the subjects for this experiment. They live in the same dormitory and a similar lifestyle to regular military personnel. Tests were carried out on two successive days, and in between the two testing sessions, each subject was requested to refrain from smoking for 24 hours. During the testing sessions, EEGs were recorded with eyes closed, before and after smoking. Two-dimensional maps were generated by unbiased polynomial interpolation for alpha activity. Various blood chemical measurements were made, among which, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and percentage of carbon monoxide hemoglobin (%COHb) were studied in relation to EEG changes. The smoking induced wide-spread amplitude decrease in the alpha maps. After 24 hours of withdrawal, alpha amplitude increased, although it decreased again when smoking resumed. Either the correlation between EEG amplitude and %COHb, or the correlation between EEG amplitude and pCO2, was examined in three regions (anterior: A, middle: M and posterior: P) of the two-dimensional maps in both slow and quick smokers. There were no correlations observed between changes in the EEG amplitude and changes in %COHb induced by smoking, in any of the three regions in either fast or slow smokers. However, there was a clear correlation between changes in the EEG amplitude and changes in pCO2 in quick smokers, the correlation coefficient being approximately -0.7. It is possible that this relationship was due to hyperventilation, since the same tendency was not observed in slow smokers.

Sensory cortical processing and the biological basis of personality.	DOI: 10.1016/0006-3223(94)00177-5	Action-oriented personality traits such as sensation seeking, extraversion, and impulsivity have been related to a pronounced amplitude increase of auditory evoked scalp potentials with increasing stimulus intensity. Dipole source analysis represents a crucial methodological progress in this context, because overlapping subcomponents of the scalp potentials can be separated and can be related to their generating cortical structures. In a study on 40 healthy subjects, it was found that sensation seeking is clearly related to the auditory evoked response pattern (N1/P2-component, stimulus intensities: 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 dB SPL) of the superior temporal plane including primary auditory cortex, but not to that of secondary auditory areas in the lateral temporal cortex. These results support the concept that the serotonergic brain system, which is supposed to modulate sensory processing in primary auditory cortices, is an important factor underlying individual differences in sensation seeking.

Direct evidence that acutely enhancing serotonin with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram modulates the loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) marker of central serotonin function.	DOI: 10.1002/hup.740	The loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) has been suggested as a reliable measure of central serotonin function in humans. The most convincing evidence for a direct relationship between serotonergic function and LDAEP to date has come from animal studies, while evidence in humans has been circumstantial and inconsistent. In the current study, we examine the direct effect of serotonergic modulation with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram on the LDAEP. The study was a double-blind placebo controlled design in which healthy participants were tested under two acute treatment conditions: placebo and citalopram (20 mg). Enhancement of serotonin function with citalopram in comparison to placebo decreased the slope of the LDAEP (i.e. weaker LDAEP). The findings provide direct evidence in humans, of a relationship between central serotonin function and the LDAEP, supporting findings previously observed in animals and clinical populations. Together the results provide further support for the validity of the LDAEP as a non-invasive in vivo measure of central serotonin function in humans.

Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were collected from a population of neurotics (100 patients), including a group of 50 subjects suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and the rest having generalized anxiety disorder. Twenty-five, age- and sex-matched, healthy volunteers served as controls. BAEPs were recorded by standard techniques as recommended by the AEEGS Clinical Evoked Potentials Guidelines. A one-way analysis of variance and the Fisher least-significant difference test were used for statistical analysis of the data. After stimulation of the right ear, a significant increase of wave I-V interpeak latency was found in the two groups of patients as compared with that of controls. Moreover OCD patients had a significantly reduced amplitude of wave III when compared to that of the control group.

Immunoreactivity of sera to a peptide derived from the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor in a group of children with developmental disorders: possible role in non-autistic epilepsy.	DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.1.1.185	The presence of autoantibodies against the serotoninergic 5-HT1A receptor has been reported in serum from an autistic child using radioligand binding studies. It is now well established that, in cardiovascular diseases with an autoimmune component, patients present in their sera autoantibodies directed against the second extracellular loop of some G-protein coupled membrane receptors. We thus investigated by an enzyme-immunoassay method the presence of anti-5-HT1A receptor antibodies in sera of children with developmental disorders using synthetic peptides corresponding to the first and the second extracellular loops of this receptor. The population of children with developmental disorders was divided in autistic children with or without EEG abnormalities, and in non-autistic children with or without EEG abnormalities. We found that 6 out of 10 sera of non-autistic children with an abnormal EEG recognized the second extracellular loop of the 5-HT1A receptor. This is significantly higher than the other groups of children with developmental disorders or a healthy control group. These observations support the existence of an autoimmune component in epilepsy.

Allelic variation in serotonin transporter function associated with the intensity dependence of the auditory evoked potential.	DOI: 10.1002/ajmg.b.10019	The intensity dependence of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) has been suggested as an indicator of central serotonergic function, a strong intensity dependence presumably reflecting low serotonergic activity. As individual differences in serotonergic neurotransmission can be accounted for in part by genetic variation in genes of the serotonergic pathway, we investigated whether a functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) is associated with the AEP intensity dependence. Because dopaminergic influences on the intensity dependence have also been reported, we furthermore explored the role of a functional polymorphism in the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4 exon III) in the modulation of the AEP intensity dependence. AEPs to tones of six intensity levels were recorded from 60 healthy young individuals, and N1/P2 linear as well as median slopes at central electrode sites were computed as measures of the AEP intensity dependence. Analyses of variance showed that there was a significant effect of the 5-HTTLPR on the AEP intensity dependence. Individuals with the ll genotype exhibited a stronger intensity dependence compared to individuals with the ls genotype. This effect was even more pronounced when DRD4 exon III was considered in the analyses. In conclusion, these findings provide further evidence for a role of serotonergic neurotransmission in the modulation of the AEP intensity dependence. The results also point to possible dopaminergic influences on the AEP intensity dependence.

Dichotic listening tests of functional brain asymmetry predict response to fluoxetine in depressed women and men.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1300519	Patients having a depressive disorder vary widely in their therapeutic responsiveness to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), but there are no clinical predictors of treatment outcome. Studies using dichotic listening, electrophysiologic and neuroimaging measures suggest that pretreatment differences among depressed patients in functional brain asymmetry are related to responsiveness to antidepressants. Two new studies replicate differences in dichotic listening asymmetry between fluoxetine responders and nonresponders, and demonstrate the importance of gender in this context. Right-handed outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for major depression, dysthymia, or depression not otherwise specified were tested on dichotic fused-words and complex tones tests before completing 12 weeks of fluoxetine treatment. Perceptual asymmetry (PA) scores were compared for 75 patients (38 women) who responded to treatment and 39 patients (14 women) who were nonresponders. Normative data were also obtained for 101 healthy adults (61 women). Patients who responded to fluoxetine differed from nonresponders and healthy adults in favoring left- over right-hemisphere processing of dichotic stimuli, and this difference was dependent on gender and test. Heightened left-hemisphere advantage for dichotic words in responders was present among women but not men, whereas reduced right-hemisphere advantage for dichotic tones in responders was present among men but not women. Pretreatment PA was also predictive of change in depression severity following treatment. Responder vs nonresponder differences for verbal dichotic listening in women and nonverbal dichotic listening in men are discussed in terms of differences in cognitive function, hemispheric organization, and neurotransmitter function.

Error-related Brain Activity as a Treatment Moderator and Index of Symptom Change during Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2017.289	Increased neural error monitoring, as measured by the error-related negativity (ERN), is a transdiagnostic neurobiological marker of anxiety. To date, little is known about whether the ERN can inform the choice between first-line anxiety disorder treatments and whether the ERN changes following treatment completion. The aim of the study was to therefore assess whether the ERN is a treatment moderator and index of symptom change during cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Participants included adult volunteers (M age=25.8±8.5; 67% female) with principal anxiety disorders (n=60) or no lifetime history of Axis I psychopathology (ie, healthy controls; n=26). A flanker task was used to elicit the ERN at baseline and 12 weeks later, following either CBT or SSRIs in the patient sample. Results indicated that baseline ERN was a significant treatment moderator such that a more enhanced baseline ERN was associated with greater reduction in anxiety symptoms within individuals who received CBT but not SSRIs. Results also revealed that the ERN increased pre- to post-treatment among patients randomized to SSRIs, but remained stable among patients randomized to CBT and healthy controls. Together, these novel findings highlight that ERN may help guide treatment decisions regarding engagement in CBT or SSRIs, especially among individuals with an enhanced ERN. The findings also suggest that SSRIs have the capacity to alter individual differences in the ERN, providing evidence that the ERN is not entirely static in patients with anxiety disorders.

Electrophysiological indication for a link between serotonergic neurotransmission and personality in alcoholism.	DOI: 10.1016/s0278-5846(01)00241-x	"The serotonergic neurotransmission seems to be involved in the neuropsychobiology of alcoholism. The intensity dependence of the N1/P2 component of auditory-evoked potentials is discussed as an indicator of the central serotonergic neurotransmission in healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to verify this correlation between intensity dependence and serotonergic neurotransmission, as indicated by the personality trait ""harm avoidance"" (HA) within the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) in alcohol-dependent patients. The intensity dependence was measured in 25 alcohol-dependent patients, 10 and 40 days after detoxification. The personality trait HA was assessed, which is supposed to reflect the serotonergic neurotransmission. The intensity dependence was negatively correlated with the temperament trait HA of the TCI (r = - .55, P<.01) at Day 40, but neither on Day 10 nor with the other personality dimensions. We conclude, that the intensity dependence reflects the serotonergic neurotransmission in withdrawn alcohol-dependent patients."

The Idea Is Good, but…: Failure to Replicate Associations of Oxytocinergic Polymorphisms with Face-Inversion in the N170.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0151991	In event-related potentials, the N170 manifests itself especially in reaction to faces. In the healthy population, face-inversion leads to stronger negative amplitudes and prolonged latencies of the N170, effects not being present in patients with autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD). ASD has frequently been associated with differences in oxytocinergic neurotransmission. This ERP-study aimed to investigate the face-inversion effect in association with oxytocinergic candidate genes. It was expected that risk-allele-carriers of the oxytocin-receptor-gene-polymorphism (rs53576) and of CD38 (rs379863) responded similar to upright and inverted faces as persons with ASD. Additionally, reactions to different facial emotional expressions were studied. As there have been difficulties with replications of those molecular genetic association studies, we aimed to replicate our findings in a second study.

Differences in central serotoninergic transmission among patients with recent onset, sub-chronic, and chronic schizophrenia as assessed by the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials.	DOI: 10.1016/j.schres.2015.07.036	Previous research has shown that abnormalities in serotonin systems are associated with schizophrenia. The loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) has been used as a metric of central serotonin activity. The present study aimed to evaluate LDAEP in patients with schizophrenia of differing chronicity. Sixty-four patients with schizophrenia and 50 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. LDAEP and psychometric ratings, such as the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), were measured. The cohort was stratified into three subgroups according to the duration of illness: recent onset (<2years, n=21), sub-chronic (2-9years, n=28), and chronic (≥10years, n=15) groups. The LDAEP differed significantly among the three groups. A post-hoc analysis (Bonferroni) demonstrated that the LDAEP differed significantly between the recent onset and chronic groups (p=0.029), and between the healthy control and chronic groups (p=0.008). Age, sex, dosage of antipsychotics, and smoking did not significantly affect the group differences. In the correlation analysis, there was a significant correlation of LDAEP values with illness duration (r=-0.259, p=0.045). The present study verifies that the LDAEP is related to the duration of illness in patients with schizophrenia. This suggests that central serotonin neurotransmission is changeable, and it may depend on the chronicity of schizophrenia pathology.

On the role of serotonin and effort in voluntary attention: evidence of genetic variation in N1 modulation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bbr.2010.07.021	Ascending serotonergic projections from the raphe nuclei to frontal brain areas and the dense distribution of receptor and transporter sites in prefrontal and sensory regions support the idea that serotonin exerts influence on cognitive functioning. Indeed, growing evidence suggests serotonin to be an important factor in learning and memory; however, its precise role in executive processes particularly in voluntary attention is less clear. Event-related EEG studies showed the N1 potential to predict top-down attention allocation and implicated the auditory N1 in central serotonergic activity. Dipole analyses and single-trial coupling of EEG and fMRI revealed N1 sources in the primary auditory cortex and in the anterior cingulate. In the present study, amplitude variation of the event-related N1 potential was investigated on 72 healthy subjects while performing an auditory novelty oddball paradigm to tap top-down and bottom-up attention allocation. Possible serotonergic effects on voluntary attention were analyzed using allele variants of a functional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) of the gene encoding the serotonin transporter, a key regulator of serotonergic neurotransmission. Because mental effort has been related to top-down attention and N1 modulation, a measure of stable individual differences in cognitive effort was included. The main result was a strong interaction of 5-HTTLPR and cognitive effort on target N1 amplitude. Greater target-related attention allocation was evident in those carriers of the 5-HTTLPR s-allele who described themselves as being more engaged in effortful processing. We suggest that the observed interaction mirrors the interplay between effort-mediated top-down attention by the ACC and serotonergic adjustment on attentional systems.

Altered frontal EEG asymmetry in obsessive-compulsive disorder.	DOI: 10.1111/psyp.12214	Hemispheric topography of alpha band power in the electroencephalogram has been linked to approach/avoidance motivation and may index the risk for anxiety disorders and depression. We quantified lower alpha band power (8-10 Hz) in 20 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and 20 matched healthy controls during blocks of rest and presentation of neutral, aversive, and OCD-related pictures. Compared to the control group, OCD patients showed altered asymmetry, with frontal alpha power in the 8-10 Hz band being more dominant in the left hemisphere across all conditions. This alteration was not observed over parietal areas, and also did not show in the upper alpha, and the theta and beta bands. This change in hemispheric topography of lower alpha band power supports the hypothesis of relatively increased avoidance motivation in OCD. Altered asymmetry appears to be traitlike in OCD, suggesting a link to depressive disorders.

Neural Responsiveness to Reward as an Index of Depressive Symptom Change Following Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and SSRI Treatment.	DOI: 10.4088/JCP.17m11836	Reward positivity (RewP), a neurophysiologic index of reward responsivity, is consistently reduced in participants with depression and, to a lesser extent, anxiety.

The current study addressed this question by examining differences in RewP within patients before and after 12 weeks of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). We also examined the utility of RewP as a predictor of symptom change during CBT and SSRI treatment.

The effect of fluoxetine on sleep: a longitudinal, double-blind polysomnographic study of healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1097/00004850-199409000-00009	Fluoxetine, a selective inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) uptake, was compared with placebo in a randomized double-blind longitudinal trial in 12 healthy volunteers. Sleep polygraphic recordings were performed at home twice before and once after 6 days of medication. After 6 days fluoxetine significantly decreased the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The sleep-onset latency and REM latency were increased, but there was no significant increase in the amount of awakenings during night. The relative proportion of stages 2 and 3 increased after fluoxetine administration, although there was no significant change with regard to total amount of slow-wave sleep. Fluoxetine did not induce prominent eye movements during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in this study. Results of the subjective assessment revealed tendencies of improved sleep and well-being in the fluoxetine group. It is concluded that a comparatively small dose of fluoxetine (20 mg/day) causes the same type of changes in REM sleep which are characteristic of most antidepressive drugs.

Error-related brain activity in youth and young adults before and after treatment for generalized or social anxiety disorder.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2016.07.010	Increased error monitoring, as measured by the error-related negativity (ERN), has been shown to persist after treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder in youth and adults; however, no previous studies have examined the ERN following treatment for related anxiety disorders. We used a flanker task to elicit the ERN in 28 youth and young adults (8-26years old) with primary diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 35 healthy controls. Patients were assessed before and after treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and healthy controls were assessed at a comparable interval. The ERN increased across assessments in the combined sample. Patients with SAD exhibited an enhanced ERN relative to healthy controls prior to and following treatment, even when analyses were limited to SAD patients who responded to treatment. Patients with GAD did not significantly differ from healthy controls at either assessment. Results provide preliminary evidence that enhanced error monitoring persists following treatment for SAD in youth and young adults, and support conceptualizations of increased error monitoring as a trait-like vulnerability that may contribute to risk for recurrence and impaired functioning later in life. Future work is needed to further evaluate the ERN in GAD across development, including whether an enhanced ERN develops in adulthood or is most apparent when worries focus on internal sources of threat.

Effect of lofepramine on 5-HT function and sleep.	DOI: 10.1016/0165-0327(93)90121-y	We studied the effect of the tricyclic antidepressant lofepramine (140-210 mg daily for 16 days) on 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptor sensitivity in healthy volunteers, using a buspirone neuroendocrine challenge paradigm (30 mg orally). We also studied the effect of lofepramine on platelet 5-HT content and sleep architecture. Lofepramine treatment did not alter the hypothermic, endocrine or amnesic effects of buspirone but significantly lowered platelet 5-HT content and decreased rapid eye movement sleep. Our findings suggest that at clinically used doses, lofepramine inhibits the uptake of 5-HT and produces changes in sleep architecture characteristic of tricyclic antidepressants.

Abnormality of Auditory Mismatch Negativity in Depression and Its Dependence on Stimulus Intensity.	DOI: 10.1177/1550059415584704	Mismatch negativity (MMN) is thought to reveal several abnormalities of cognitive functioning. Although depression often affects cognitive functioning, previous studies concerning MMN in depressed patients provided conflicting results. In recent reports, it has been suggested that depressed patients may show abnormal auditory response to regular auditory stimuli presented with at a relatively high intensity. We thus recorded acoustic MMN in 16 drug-free patients suffering from moderate depression and in 10 healthy subjects at 2 different stimulus intensities. Differences in MMN latency and amplitude between depressed patients and healthy subjects reached the significance level only for high intensity stimulation, and they were consistent with a dysfunction of frontal MMN subcomponents in depressed patients. This finding suggests that consistent MMN abnormalities can be observed in depressed patients by using high-intensity stimulation; moreover, it supports the hypothesis of disturbances of frontal networks in depression even in early stages of disease.

Differential modulations of response control processes by 5-HT1A gene variation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.11.067	Response selection and control are supposed to reflect important basal ganglia functions. Recently, we showed that the dopaminergic system may be especially important for response selection in compatible, but not in incompatible stimulus-response (S-R) relations. Research indicates that the dopaminergic system is influenced by the serotonergic system, but little is known about the involvement of the serotonergic system in response selection. Analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs) in a sample of healthy probands (N=74), we show the 5-HT1A C(-1019)G polymorphism modulating response-related processes, as reflected in the N2 component, in compatible, but not incompatible, S-R relations. This modulation was a function of the number of -1019 G alleles. Decreasing numbers of -1019 G alleles were stepwise related to increases in the N2 on compatible trials and concomitant increases in response times. The functional effect of the 5-HT1A C(-1019)G polymorphism has previously been shown to be specific for serotonergic 1 A autoreceptors of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Due to this close relation of genotype effects to neuroanatomically dissociable structures, the results suggest that DRN serotonin 1 A autoreceptors are important for compatible S-R relations, i.e., response selection, but not for incompatible S-R relations, i.e. response conflict or inhibition. The results extend previous findings on the dopaminergic system to the serotonergic system. The examined functions are precisely regulated on a neuronal level, since neurophysiological and behavioural effects are driven in an allele-dose fashion. Because of this, the results are of importance for future clinical applications.

Evidence for disturbed cortical signal processing and altered serotonergic neurotransmission in generalized anxiety disorder.	DOI: 10.1016/s0006-3223(02)01478-6	Current pathophysiological concepts of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) assume a disturbed exteroceptive sensory system. Furthermore, central serotonergic neurotransmission has been shown to play an important role in anxiety disorder. Cortical signal processing as measured by auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) may reflect the integrity of the exteroceptive sensory system. Because a special aspect of AEP, the loudness dependence of the N1/P2-component (LD), has been related to central serotonergic activity, the LD may be useful for investigating serotonergic dysfunctions in GAD.

Further evidence for an association of 5-HTTLPR with intensity dependence of auditory-evoked potentials.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1301020	Intensity dependence of auditory-evoked potentials (IAEP) has been suggested as an indicator of central serotonergic neurotransmission. Two recent studies investigated a possible association of IAEP with a functional polymorphism in the transcriptional control region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) that has a short (s) and a long (l) variant. Although both studies found an association between 5-HTTLPR and IAEP, Gallinat et al found l/l individuals to exhibit lower IAEP, whereas Strobel et al observed stronger IAEP in l/l individuals. These conflicting results require further evaluation and more attention needs to be paid to variables that are known to be confounded with the effects of IAEP and 5-HTTLPR. Using a paradigm comparable to Strobel et al, the present study analyzes the effect of 5-HTTLPR on IAEP in a healthy male student sample (N=91; age=23 years, SD=1.9) that was homogenous for most significant confounding variables. A stronger IAEP was shown in l/l individuals, irrespective of the method of IAEP parametrization. This also held at retest after 3 weeks in a subsample (N=18). Given the successful replication of Strobel et al, several possible reasons for conflicting results with regard to Gallinat et al are discussed. It is argued that the most significant difference between Gallinat et al on the one hand, and Strobel et al and this study on the other, is that different intensity ranges are used which impact IAEP. Therefore, this study encourages further analysis of dose dependence of results.

Brain arousal regulation in SSRI-medicated patients with major depression.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.11.003	EEG measures of arousal have been suggested as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for major depression. The aim of the present study was to examine whether self-rated depression severity in SSRI-medicated patients with major depression (MD) is associated with EEG measures of brain arousal. Based on previous studies, we expected that a higher level of brain arousal and a slower arousal decline during a 15-min EEG recording are associated with higher symptom severity as assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at the time of the EEG recording. EEGs of 78 MD patients and 46 healthy controls were analyzed. Brain arousal was assessed using the Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig (VIGALL 2.1). Based on automatically classified 1-s segments (EEG-vigilance Stages 0, A1, A2, A3, B1, B2/3 or C) we computed indices to assess the level (mean EEG-vigilance) and the decline of arousal (slope index) during the 15-min resting state EEG under eyes-closed condition. We found that a higher arousal level and a slower arousal decline corresponded to higher severity of depressive symptoms (rho = 0.238, p = .018; and rho = 0.236; p = .019). Self-rated non-remitters (BDI>12) had a higher arousal level (mean EEG-vigilance: t76 = -2.19, p = .016) and slower arousal decline (slope index: Z = -2.08, p = .019) during the 15-min recording as compared to remitters. Similar results were obtained between non-remitters and healthy controls (mean EEG-vigilance: t102 = -2.75, p = .004; slope index: Z = -1.92, p = .028), but not between remitters and controls (p > .260). The findings support the model that brain arousal regulation plays an important role in the pathophysiology and treatment of MD.

Broadband cortical desynchronization underlies the human psychedelic state.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2063-13.2013	Psychedelic drugs produce profound changes in consciousness, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms for this remain unclear. Spontaneous and induced oscillatory activity was recorded in healthy human participants with magnetoencephalography after intravenous infusion of psilocybin--prodrug of the nonselective serotonin 2A receptor agonist and classic psychedelic psilocin. Psilocybin reduced spontaneous cortical oscillatory power from 1 to 50 Hz in posterior association cortices, and from 8 to 100 Hz in frontal association cortices. Large decreases in oscillatory power were seen in areas of the default-mode network. Independent component analysis was used to identify a number of resting-state networks, and activity in these was similarly decreased after psilocybin. Psilocybin had no effect on low-level visually induced and motor-induced gamma-band oscillations, suggesting that some basic elements of oscillatory brain activity are relatively preserved during the psychedelic experience. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that posterior cingulate cortex desynchronization can be explained by increased excitability of deep-layer pyramidal neurons, which are known to be rich in 5-HT2A receptors. These findings suggest that the subjective effects of psychedelics result from a desynchronization of ongoing oscillatory rhythms in the cortex, likely triggered by 5-HT2A receptor-mediated excitation of deep pyramidal cells.

Association between wind-up ratio and central serotonergic function in healthy subjects and depressed patients.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2011.09.033	Temporal summation of C-fiber evoked responses generates an increase in action potential discharge in second-order neurons and in perceived pain intensity (wind-up). This may be related to the central serotonergic system which modulates and partly inhibits sensory input. Aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between wind-up and serotonergic activity using loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP). 18 healthy subjects were compared to 18 patients with major depression, a disease with a putative serotonin deficit. They were examined with quantitative sensory testing (QST) using the protocol of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS), including the wind-up ratio (WUR), LDAEP, and psychometric measurements. We found a slight positive correlation between WUR and LDAEP both in healthy controls and depressed patients combined (r=0.340, p=0.043), indicating that WUR may be modulated by serotonergic activity. It can be concluded that inhibitory control to noxious stimuli is partly associated with the central serotonergic function as indicated by LDAEP.

Improving response inhibition systems in frontotemporal dementia with citalopram.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awv133	Disinhibition is a cardinal feature of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia, presenting as impulsive and impetuous behaviours that are often difficult to manage. The options for symptomatic treatments are limited, but a potential target for therapy is the restoration of serotonergic function, which is both deficient in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and closely associated with inhibitory control. Based on preclinical studies and psychopharmacological interventions in other disorders, we predicted that inhibition would be associated with the right inferior frontal gyrus and dependent on serotonin. Using magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography of a Go-NoGo paradigm, we investigated the neural basis of behavioural disinhibition in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibition on the neural systems for response inhibition. In a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover design study, 12 patients received either a single 30 mg dose of citalopram or placebo. Twenty age-matched healthy controls underwent the same magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography protocol on one session without citalopram, providing normative data for this task. In the control group, successful NoGo trials evoked two established indices of successful response inhibition: the NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3. Both of these components were significantly attenuated by behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Cortical sources associated with successful inhibition in control subjects were identified in the right inferior frontal gyrus and anterior temporal lobe, which have been strongly associated with behavioural inhibition in imaging and lesion studies. These sources were impaired by behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Critically, citalopram enhanced the NoGo-P3 signal in patients, relative to placebo treatment, and increased the evoked response in the right inferior frontal gyrus. Voxel-based morphometry confirmed significant atrophy of inferior frontal gyrus, alongside insular, orbitofrontal and temporal cortex in our patient cohort. Together, these data suggest that the dysfunctional prefrontal cortical systems underlying response inhibition deficits in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia can be partially restored by increasing serotonergic neurotransmission. The results support a translational neuroscience approach to impulsive neurological disorders and indicate the potential for symptomatic treatment of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia including serotonergic strategies to improve disinhibition.media-1vid110.1093/brain/awv133_video_abstractawv133_video_abstract.

One-week escitalopram intake alters the excitation-inhibition balance in the healthy female brain.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.25760	Neural health relies on cortical excitation-inhibition balance (EIB). Previous research suggests a link between increased cortical excitation and neuroplasticity induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Whether there are modulations of EIB following SSRI-administration in the healthy human brain, however, remains unclear. Thus, in a randomized double-blind study, we administered a clinically relevant dose of 20 mg escitalopram for 7 days (time when steady state is achieved) in 59 healthy women (28 escitalopram, 31 placebo) on oral contraceptives. We acquired resting-state electroencephalography data at baseline, after a single dose, and at steady state. We assessed 1/f slope of the power spectrum as a marker of EIB, compared individual trajectories of 1/f slope changes contrasting single dose and 1-week drug intake, and tested the relationship of escitalopram plasma levels and cortical excitatory and inhibitory balance shifts. Escitalopram-intake was associated with decreased 1/f slope, indicating an EIB shift in favor of excitation. Furthermore, 1/f slope at baseline and after a single dose of escitalopram was associated with 1/f slope at steady state. Higher plasma escitalopram levels at a single dose were associated with better maintenance of these EIB changes throughout the drug administration week. These findings demonstrate the potential for 1/f slope to predict individual cortical responsivity to SSRIs and widen the lens through which we map the human brain by testing an interventional psychopharmacological design in a clearly defined endocrinological state.

Long-term plasticity of visually evoked potentials in humans is altered in major depression.	DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.10.006	Long-term synaptic plasticity is a ubiquitous form of neuronal plasticity that regulates the strength of synaptic transmission in many brain areas. However, most data on long-term potentiation and long-term depression rely on research in animal brain slices. The role of synaptic plasticity in physiology and pathology of the functioning human brain remains obscure.

Intensity dependence of auditory-evoked cortical potentials in fibromyalgia patients: a test of the generalized hypervigilance hypothesis.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpain.2006.01.452	"On the basis of recent evidence concerning the amplification of incoming stimulation in fibromyalgia (FM) patients, it has been proposed that a generalized hypervigilance of painful and nonpainful sensations may be at the root of this disorder. So far, research into this issue has been inconclusive, possibly owing to the lack of agreement as to the operational definition of ""generalized hypervigilance"" and to the lack of robust objective measures characterizing the sensory style of FM patients. In this study, we recorded auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) elicited by tones of increasing intensity (60, 70, 80, 90, and 105 dB) in 27 female FM patients and 25 healthy controls. Fibromyalgia patients presented shorter N1 and P2 latencies and a stronger intensity dependence of their AEPs. Both results suggest that FM patients may be hypervigilant to sensory stimuli, especially when very loud tones are used. The most noteworthy difference between patients and control subjects is at the highest stimulus intensity, for which far more patients maintained increased N1-P2 amplitudes in relation to the 90-dB tones. The larger AEP amplitudes to the 105-dB tones suggest that defects in an inhibitory system protecting against overstimulation may be a crucial factor in the pathophysiology of FM. Because a stronger loudness dependence of AEPs has been related to weak serotonergic transmission, it is hypothesized that for many FM patients deficient inhibition of the response to noxious and intense auditory stimuli may be due to a serotonergic deficit."

Gender differences in association between serotonin transporter gene polymorphism and resting-state EEG activity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.10.030	Human brain oscillations represent important features of information processing and are highly heritable. Gender has been observed to affect association between the 5-HTTLPR (serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region) polymorphism and various endophenotypes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 5-HTTLPR on the spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) activity in healthy male and female subjects. DNA samples extracted from buccal swabs and resting EEG recorded at 60 standard leads were collected from 210 (101 men and 109 women) volunteers. Spectral EEG power estimates and cortical sources of EEG activity were investigated. It was shown that effects of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on electrical activity of the brain vary as a function of gender. Women with the S/L genotype had greater global EEG power compared to men with the same genotype. In men, current source density was markedly different among genotype groups in only alpha 2 and alpha 3 frequency ranges: S/S allele carriers had higher current source density estimates in the left inferior parietal lobule in comparison with the L/L group. In women, genotype difference in global power asymmetry was found in the central-temporal region. Contrasting L/L and S/L genotype carriers also yielded significant effects in the right hemisphere inferior parietal lobule and the right postcentral gyrus with L/L genotype carriers showing lower current source density estimates than S/L genotype carriers in all but gamma bands. So, in women, the effects of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were associated with modulation of the EEG activity in a wide range of EEG frequencies. The significance of the results lies in the demonstration of gene by sex interaction with resting EEG that has implications for understanding sex-related differences in affective states, emotion and cognition.

Interactive effects of citalopram and serotonin transporter genotype on neural correlates of response inhibition and attentional orienting.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.064	The brain's serotonergic (5-HT) system has been implicated in controlling impulsive behavior and attentional orienting and linked to impulse control and anxiety related disorders. However, interactions between genotypical variation and responses to serotonergic drugs impede both treatment efficacy and neuroscientific research. We examine behavioral and electrophysiological responses to acute intravenous administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) while controlling for major genetic differences regarding 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) genotypes. Out of a genotyped sample of healthy Caucasian subjects (n=878) two extreme-groups regarding 5-HTT genotypes were selected (n=32). A homozygous high-expressing group based on tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR and rs25532 (LAC/LAC=LL) was compared to homozygous S allele carriers (SS). Both groups were administered a low dose of citalopram (10mg) intravenously in a double blind crossover fashion and performed a novelty NoGo paradigm while high density EEG was recorded. Interactions between drug and genotype were seen on both behavioral and neurophysiological levels. Reaction slowing following inhibitory events was decreased by the administration of citalopram in the LL but not SS group. This was accompanied by decreases in the amplitude of the inhibitory N2 EEG component and the P3b in the LL group, which was not seen in the SS group. SS subjects showed an increase in P3a amplitudes following SSRI administration to any type of deviant stimulus possibly reflecting increased attentional capture. The acute SSRI response on inhibitory processes and attentional orienting interacts with genotypes regulating 5-HTT gene expression. SS subjects may show increased attentional side effects reflected in increases in P3a amplitudes which could contribute to treatment discontinuation. Inhibitory processes and their neural correlates are affected only in LL subjects. These findings may indicate an underlying mechanism that could relate genotypical differences to altered side effect profiles and drug responses and are compatible with a non-monotonic relationship between 5-HT levels and optimal functioning.

Activation of the anterior prefrontal cortex and serotonergic system is associated with improvements in mood and EEG changes induced by Zen meditation practice in novices.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2011.02.004	To gain insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in Zen meditation, we evaluated the effects of focused attention (FA) on breathing movements in the lower abdomen (Tanden) in novices. We investigated hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), an attention-related brain region, using 24-channel near-infrared spectroscopy during a 20-minute session of FA on Tanden breathing in 15 healthy volunteers. We found that the level of oxygenated hemoglobin in the anterior PFC was significantly increased during FA on Tanden breathing, accompanied by a reduction in feelings of negative mood compared to before the meditation session. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed increased alpha band activity and decreased theta band activity during and after FA on Tanden breathing. EEG changes were correlated with a significant increase in whole blood serotonin (5-HT) levels. These results suggest that activation of the anterior PFC and 5-HT system may be responsible for the improvement of negative mood and EEG signal changes observed during FA on Tanden breathing.

Examining the underpinnings of loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials with positron emission tomography.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116733	Loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) has long been considered to reflect central basal serotonin transmission. However, the relationship between LDAEP and individual serotonin receptors and transporters has not been fully explored in humans and may involve other neurotransmitter systems. To examine LDAEP's relationship with the serotonin system, we performed PET using serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) imaging via [11C]CUMI-101 and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) imaging via [11C]DASB on a mixed sample of healthy controls (n ​= ​4: 4 females, 0 males), patients with unipolar (MDD, n ​= ​11: 4 females, 7 males) and bipolar depression (BD, n ​= ​8: 4 females, 4 males). On these same participants, we also performed electroencephalography (EEG) within a week of PET scanning, using 1000 ​Hz tones of varying intensity to evoke LDAEP. We then evaluated the relationship between LDAEP and 5-HT1A or 5-HTT binding in both the raphe (5-HT1A)/midbrain (5-HTT) areas and in the temporal cortex. We found that LDAEP was significantly correlated with 5-HT1A positively and with 5-HTT negatively in the temporal cortex (p ​< ​0.05), but not correlated with either in midbrain or raphe. In males only, exploratory analysis showed multiple regions in which LDAEP significantly correlated with 5-HT1A throughout the brain; we did not find this with 5-HTT. This multimodal study partially validates preclinical models of a serotonergic influence on LDAEP. Replication in larger samples is necessary to further clarify our understanding of the role of serotonin in perception of auditory tones.

The role of serotonin in those psychophysiological parameters of attention that are already found to be disturbed in schizophrenia, e.g. processing negativity (PN), mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 amplitude, is poorly understood. In the present study the effects of increased serotonergic activity on these psychophysiological parameters is investigated. In a balanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over experiment 18 healthy male volunteers received an oral dose of either placebo or of 10 mg escitalopram (a highly specific SSRI) on two separate test days, after which they were tested in an auditory selective attention paradigm and a MMN paradigm. Escitalopram significantly increased PN and MMN compared to placebo, without affecting the P300 amplitude. Furthermore, administration of escitalopram resulted in a small, yet significant, reduction of task performance in the selective attention paradigm compared to placebo, while it did not affect reaction time. Contrary to what was expected, escitalopram enhanced PN and MMN, without affecting the P300 amplitude. The results are discussed in the light of dosage issues and subtypes of serotonergic receptors.

A single high dose of escitalopram increases mismatch negativity without affecting processing negativity or P300 amplitude in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881109102606	Information processing deficits are commonly found in psychiatric illnesses, while at the biochemical level serotonin seems to play a role in nearly all psychiatric disorders. Processing negativity (PN), mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 amplitude are electrophysiological measures of information processing. The present study was designed to replicate and further extent the results of our initial study on the effects of a low dose of escitalopram (10 mg) on MMN, PN and P300 amplitude. In a randomised, double-blind, cross-over experiment, 20 healthy male volunteers received either a single, orally administered dose of 15 mg escitalopram (a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)) or placebo, after which their PN, MMN and P300 amplitude were assessed. Similar to our initial study with 10 mg escitalopram, 15 mg escitalopram significantly increased MMN, while it did not affect P300 amplitude. In contrast to our initial study, however, the currently higher dose of escitalopram did not increase PN. Results support the view that a broad range of increased serotonergic activity enhances MMN, while the relationship between serotonin and PN seems more complex. The current study does not support a serotonergic involvement in P300 amplitude.

Allelic variation of serotonin transporter function modulates the brain electrical response for error processing.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1300409	A functional length variation in the transcriptional control region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) influences brain function, personality traits, and susceptibility to psychiatric disorders. Here we measured prefrontal brain function by means of event-related potentials during an error processing paradigm. Physiologically, occurrence of an error elicits two specific electrical responses in the prefrontal cortex, the early error related negativity (Ne/ERN) and the later occurring error positivity (Pe), reflecting different components of error processing. Healthy subjects with one or two copies of the low-activity 5-HTTLPR short variant showed significantly higher amplitudes of the Ne/ERN and a trend to higher amplitudes of the Pe as compared to age- and gender-matched individuals homozygous for the long allele. Performance measures and latencies of these ERP-components did not differ between groups. These results indicate that the 5-HTTLPR short variant is associated with enhanced responsiveness of the brain and further supports the notion that prefrontal brain function is influenced by allelic variation in serotonin transporter function.

The 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone enhances EEG slow wave activity in human sleep and produces a power spectrum similar to 5-HT2 blockade.	DOI: 10.1016/0304-3940(96)12607-0	The REM sleep-suppressing effect of postsynaptic 5-HT1A stimulation has been well established. Here we investigate the effects of the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone (10 and 20 mg) on sleep EEG power spectra during non-REM sleep in nine healthy humans. At the lower dose, slow wave activity (SWA; EEG power in the delta (1-4.5 Hz) range) was significantly enhanced. At the higher dose, where side-effects occurred, the enhancement in SWA was not significant. The spectral profile was characterized by a bimodal increase of power in the lower delta and in the theta (5-8 Hz) frequencies, and by troughs at 4 Hz and at 11 Hz, a pattern compellingly similar to that reported for a 5-HT2 antagonist (seganserin). We propose that the spectral data following the lower ipsapirone dose reflect a net decrease of neuronal activity at 5-HT2 receptors, mediated through stimulation of somatodendritic autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei (presynaptic) and/or through stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors colocalized with 5-HT2 receptors. The spectral non-REM sleep EEG profile might be used to investigate central 5-HT function in humans.

An electrophysiological endophenotype of hypomanic and hyperthymic personality.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jad.2006.11.018	Hyperthymic Temperament (HYT) and a closely related trait, Hypomanic Personality (HYP), have both been related to bipolar affective disorder (BAD). Intensity dependence of auditory evoked potentials (IAEP) is a suggested inverse indicator of serotonergic neurotransmission and has been found to be elevated in BAD. Therefore the present study explored for the first time whether subclinical variance of HYT/HYP is also associated with IAEP in a healthy sample. As several traits from biological personality research are correlated with HYT/HYP and also with BAD, the specificity of results against these traits was further analyzed by calculating multiple regression analyses.

Human brain effects of DMT assessed via EEG-fMRI.	DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2218949120	Psychedelics have attracted medical interest, but their effects on human brain function are incompletely understood. In a comprehensive, within-subjects, placebo-controlled design, we acquired multimodal neuroimaging [i.e., EEG-fMRI (electroencephalography-functional MRI)] data to assess the effects of intravenous (IV) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on brain function in 20 healthy volunteers. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was acquired prior to, during, and after a bolus IV administration of 20 mg DMT, and, separately, placebo. At dosages consistent with the present study, DMT, a serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist, induces a deeply immersive and radically altered state of consciousness. DMT is thus a useful research tool for probing the neural correlates of conscious experience. Here, fMRI results revealed robust increases in global functional connectivity (GFC), network disintegration and desegregation, and a compression of the principal cortical gradient under DMT. GFC × subjective intensity maps correlated with independent positron emission tomography (PET)-derived 5-HT2AR maps, and both overlapped with meta-analytical data implying human-specific psychological functions. Changes in major EEG-measured neurophysiological properties correlated with specific changes in various fMRI metrics, enriching our understanding of the neural basis of DMT's effects. The present findings advance on previous work by confirming a predominant action of DMT-and likely other 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics-on the brain's transmodal association pole, i.e., the neurodevelopmentally and evolutionarily recent cortex that is associated with species-specific psychological advancements, and high expression of 5-HT2A receptors.

The effects of venlafaxine on cortical motor area activity in healthy subjects: a pilot study.	DOI: 10.1097/JCP.0000000000000056	In the study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging associated with behavioral assessment to observe the effects of venlafaxine on the modulation of human motor cortex activation and to provide preliminary data for further assessing its influence on motor functional reorganization after stroke injury. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 8 right-handed subjects received 75 mg of either venlafaxine or a placebo daily over a period of 7 days separated by 3 washout days. The volunteers were asked to execute motor tasks, which included the dynamometer and finger-tapping test. In addition, laboratory tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging examination, before the start of the experiment and after administration of placebo and venlafaxine, were performed. It was shown that the finger-tapping rate of each hand in the venlafaxine stage was significantly improved compared with that observed in the placebo stage (n = 8, F left hand = 57.69, F right hand = 184.48, P < 0.001). The changes in the recorded grip strengths of both hands were not significant between the stages (n = 8, F = 2.63, P > 0.05). In the venlafaxine stage, the activations of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex, contralateral premotor cortex, and contralateral supplementary motor area were enhanced significantly, whereas the activation of the bilateral parietal cortices was decreased when compared with the placebo stage. Meanwhile, the enhancement of contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex activation had a positive correlation with the improvement of the finger-tapping rate. It was concluded that venlafaxine could modulate the cortical excitability and improve finger dexterity and reaction speed, which greatly related to the increase of contralateral motor cortical excitability.

Interactive effect of 5-HTTLPR genotype and age on sources of cortical rhythms in healthy women.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2016.09.002	This study was aimed to localize the effects of 5-HTTLPR (serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region) on the age differences of spontaneous EEG activity in women using neuroimaging analysis sLORETA (Standardized Low Resolution brain Electromagnetic Tomography). DNA samples extracted from cheek swabs and resting-state EEG recorded at 60 standard leads were collected from young (YW, N=86, 18-35years) and older (OW, N=45; 55-80years) healthy women. We have shown that advanced age was associated with increased posterior EEG desynchronization in S'/S'. S' (LG allele was grouped with S alleles owing to its functional equivalence and this group was labeled as S') genotype carriers denoted by decrease of delta - beta1 current source density, and to a lesser extent in L/L homozygotes denoted by decrease in delta activity. In heterozygotes OW, as compared with heterozygotes YW, higher source density estimates of beta1 in frontal and temporal cortex were observed. Age differences were more pronounced in the right hemisphere in S'/S' and L/L carriers and in the left hemisphere in heterozygotes. We also found that in OW, current source density estimates of theta, alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 and beta1 sources in the right occipital lobe were higher in S'/L than in S'/S' carriers. These results may have implications for understanding 5-HTT-dependent variation in the effect of aging on brain activity.

Increased error-related brain activity in youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder and other anxiety disorders.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2013.02.017	The error-related negativity (ERN) is a negative deflection in the event-related potential after an incorrect response that is thought to reflect activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and is often increased in patients with anxiety disorders. This study measured the ERN and correct response negativity (CRN) during an Eriksen flanker task to assess performance monitoring in 26 youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), 13 youth with a non-OCD anxiety disorder consisting of either generalized anxiety disorder or separation anxiety disorder, and 27 age-matched healthy controls ranging in age from 8 to 16 years. Compared to healthy controls, ERN amplitude was significantly increased in patients with either OCD or a non-OCD anxiety disorder. There were no significant group differences in CRN amplitude. Treatment with a serotonergic antidepressant or cognitive-behavior therapy had no effect on the ERN in patients. Scores from the Child Behavior Checklist DSM-oriented anxiety problems scale had a significant correlation with ERN amplitude in all subjects. The results provide further evidence that the pathophysiology of OCD and some non-OCD anxiety disorders involves increased ACC activity and that the ERN may serve as a quantitative phenotype in genetic and longitudinal studies of these complex traits.

Intensity dependence of auditory evoked potentials is pronounced in migraine: an indication of cortical potentiation and low serotonergic neurotransmission?	DOI: 10.1212/wnl.46.5.1404	Migraine is associated with stimulus hypersensitivity, increased evoked cortical responses, and abnormal 5-HT levels in peripheral blood. We studied cortical auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) between attacks in 35 patients suffering from migraine without aura (MO, n = 25) or with aura (MA, n = 10) and in 25 healthy volunteers. Binaural tones were delivered at 40, 50, 60, and 70 dB sensation level (SL) in a pseudorandomized order. The intensity dependence of the auditory N1-P2 component was significantly greater in MO (p = 0.003) and MA (p = 0.02) patients than in healthy controls, resulting in a much steeper amplitude/stimulus intensity function slope. When three sequential blocks of 40 averaged responses were analyzed at the 40- and 70-dB SL intensities, N1-P2 amplitude decreased in second and third blocks at both intensities in controls, but increased in migraineurs, a difference that was significant in both blocks for the 70-dB SL stimulus. The strong interictal dependence of AEPs on stimulus intensity may thus be due to potentiation (instead of habituation) of the response during repetition of the high-intensity stimulation. In concordance with previous studies of visual evoked potentials, these results confirm that migraine is characterized between attacks by an abnormality of cortical information processing, which might be a consequence of low 5-HT transmission and favor cortical energy demands.

The use of sleep measures to compare a new 5HT1A agonist with buspirone in humans.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881105058775	The partial agonist buspirone has a REM (rapid eye movement) suppressing effect on human sleep probably via a 5HT(1A) receptor in the pontine area. Eptapirone is a new 5HT(1A) agonist with a greater intrinsic effect than buspirone. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of eptapirone on sleep architecture, particularly REM sleep, in normal volunteers and compare it with buspirone and placebo. This was a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled four-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Volunteers were screened to ensure that they had normal overnight sleep EEG (electroencephalogram) and were extensive CYP 2D6 metabolizers. Sleep was recorded on pairs of nights on four occasions, with medication being taken before the second night. Treatments were eptapirone 1.5mg at 10 AM, eptapirone 1.5mg at 11 PM, buspirone 20mg at 11 PM and placebo. Standard measures of sleep were derived and compared among the four treatments using ANOVA. REM sleep was significantly suppressed supporting the proposition that activation of post-synaptic 5HT(1A) receptors reduces REM sleep. Sleep fragmentation increased by both drugs. REM sleep suppression was significantly greater with morning eptapirone than with buspirone. Wakefulness in sleep was significantly greatest after morning eptapirone. REM sleep effects were greatest after evening eptapirone, suggesting a greater effect on central serotonin receptors than that of buspirone.

Effects of the 5-HT2A agonist psilocybin on mismatch negativity generation and AX-continuous performance task: implications for the neuropharmacology of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1300005	Previously the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine was shown to disrupt generation of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) mismatch negativity (MMN) and the performance of an 'AX'-type continuous performance test (AX-CPT)--measures of auditory and visual context-dependent information processing--in a similar manner as observed in schizophrenia. This placebo-controlled study investigated effects of the 5-HT(2A) receptor agonist psilocybin on the same measures in 18 healthy volunteers. Psilocybin administration induced significant performance deficits in the AX-CPT, but failed to reduce MMN generation significantly. These results indirectly support evidence that deficient MMN generation in schizophrenia may be a relatively distinct manifestation of deficient NMDAR functioning. In contrast, secondary pharmacological effects shared by NMDAR antagonists and the 5-HT(2A) agonist (ie disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission) may be the mechanism underlying impairments in AX-CPT performance observed during both psilocybin and ketamine administration. Comparable deficits in schizophrenia may result from independent dysfunctions of 5-HT(2A) and NMDAR-related neurotransmission.

A wavelet-based technique to predict treatment outcome for Major Depressive Disorder.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0171409	Treatment management for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has been challenging. However, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based predictions of antidepressant's treatment outcome may help during antidepressant's selection and ultimately improve the quality of life for MDD patients. In this study, a machine learning (ML) method involving pretreatment EEG data was proposed to perform such predictions for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRIs). For this purpose, the acquisition of experimental data involved 34 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. Consequently, a feature matrix was constructed involving time-frequency decomposition of EEG data based on wavelet transform (WT) analysis, termed as EEG data matrix. However, the resultant EEG data matrix had high dimensionality. Therefore, dimension reduction was performed based on a rank-based feature selection method according to a criterion, i.e., receiver operating characteristic (ROC). As a result, the most significant features were identified and further be utilized during the training and testing of a classification model, i.e., the logistic regression (LR) classifier. Finally, the LR model was validated with 100 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV). The classification results were compared with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis, and empirical mode decompositions (EMD). The wavelet features extracted from frontal and temporal EEG data were found statistically significant. In comparison with other time-frequency approaches such as the STFT and EMD, the WT analysis has shown highest classification accuracy, i.e., accuracy = 87.5%, sensitivity = 95%, and specificity = 80%. In conclusion, significant wavelet coefficients extracted from frontal and temporal pre-treatment EEG data involving delta and theta frequency bands may predict antidepressant's treatment outcome for the MDD patients.

Effects of 5HT3 receptor antagonism by tropisetron on the sleep EEG and on nocturnal hormone secretion.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.1994.39	Two dosages (5 mg and 25 mg) of the selective 5HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron (ICS 205-930) were administered to healthy male controls, and the effects on the sleep EEG and nocturnal secretory activity of growth hormone (GH) and cortisol were evaluated. The lower dosage was administered to four subjects and the higher dosage to eight on 5 consecutive days, preceded and followed by 2 days of placebo treatment. After 25 mg of tropisetron, there was a slight increase in REM sleep in the first part of the sleep period, and stage 2 was decreased during the total night. In addition, plasma cortisol levels increased earlier than under placebo, and plasma GH levels were reduced in the second part of the night. Thus, only discrete effects of tropisetron upon sleep-endocrine activity were noted, making it unlikely that serotoninergic neurotransmission exerts its well-documented effects upon sleep through 5HT3 receptors.

Differences between RNA and DNA due to RNA editing in temporal lobe epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nbd.2013.04.006	"To investigate whether alterations in RNA editing (an enzymatic base-specific change to the RNA sequence during primary transcript formation from DNA) of neurotransmitter receptor genes and of transmembrane ion channel genes play a role in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), this exploratory study analyzed 14 known cerebral editing sites in RNA extracted from the brain tissue of 41 patients who underwent surgery for mesial TLE, 23 with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE+HS). Because intraoperatively sampled RNA cannot be obtained from healthy controls and the best feasible control is identically sampled RNA from patients with a clinically shorter history of epilepsy, the primary aim of the study was to assess the correlation between epilepsy duration and RNA editing in the homogenous group of MTLE+HS. At the functionally relevant I/V site of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1, an inverse correlation of RNA editing was found with epilepsy duration (r=-0.52, p=0.01) but not with patient age at surgery, suggesting a specific association with either the epileptic process itself or its antiepileptic medication history. No significant correlations were found between RNA editing and clinical parameters at other sites within glutamate receptor or serotonin 2C receptor gene transcripts. An ""all-or-none"" (≥95% or ≤5%) editing pattern at most or all sites was discovered in 2 patients. As a secondary part of the study, RNA editing was also analyzed as in the previous literature where up to now, few single editing sites were compared with differently obtained RNA from inhomogenous patient groups and autopsies, and by measuring editing changes in our mouse model. The present screening study is first to identify an editing site correlating with a clinical parameter, and to also provide an estimate of the possible effect size at other sites, which is a prerequisite for power analysis needed in planning future studies."

Panic disorder and serotonin reuptake inhibitors predict coupling of cortical and cardiac activity.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2013.224	Panic attacks, the cardinal symptom of panic disorder (PD), are characterized by intense physiological reactions including accelerated heart activity. Although cortical processes are thought to trigger and potentiate panic attacks, it is unknown whether individuals with PD have a general tendency to show elevated cortico-cardiac interactions, which could predispose them for brain-driven modulations of heart activity during panic. Consistent with this hypothesis, serotonin, a highly relevant neurotransmitter for panic and PD presumably affects the cortical control of the heart. The current study thus aimed to test whether PD and serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) intake are related to cortico-cardiac interactions in the absence of acute panic. Human participants with PD (N=22), major depression (MD, clinical control group, N=21) or no psychiatric diagnosis (healthy control group, N=23) performed a gambling task. To measure cortico-cardiac coupling, the within-subject covariation of single-trial EEG after feedback presentation and subsequent changes in heart period was determined. As in prior studies, there was a significant time-lagged covariation of EEG and heart activity indicating that trial-by-trial fluctuations of feedback-evoked EEG amplitude determined how much heart activity accelerated seconds later. Importantly, this covariation pattern was significantly potentiated in PD vs control participants. Moreover, concurrent SRI intake further augmented brain-heart covariation in individuals with PD and MD. The present findings demonstrate that PD and serotonin are associated with altered brain-heart interactions in a non-panic situation. Future work should clarify whether brain-heart coupling has a causal role in PD, for example by facilitating panic attacks.

Absolute bioavailability and electroencephalographic effects of conventional and extended-release formulations of venlafaxine in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1998.tb04423.x	Venlafaxine is currently marketed for treatment of depressive disorders as a conventional tablet formulation with a twice or three times daily dosage regimen. The absolute bioavailability of the conventional (CF) and extended-release (XR) formulations and their effects on electroencephalograms (EEG) and on a visual analog scale (VAS) for nausea were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover, placebo-controlled study of 16 healthy young men who were given either a single oral dose of 50 mg of CF venlafaxine, 75 mg of XR venlafaxine, or an intravenous dose of 10 mg of venlafaxine, or a placebo at 1-week intervals. The absolute bioavailability of venlafaxine was between 40% and 45% and was similar for both the CF and XR formulations. Venlafaxine produced central effects of a desipramine-like antidepressant. Regardless of formulation tested, the main EEG changes were an increase in fast beta (20-30 Hz) energy, which was more pronounced over the frontotemporal regions and extended within the full beta range (16-40 Hz). Maximum effect was reached at 6 hours for the CF and reached a plateau from 10 to 24 hours for the XR formulation. A dose-proportional increase in central activity, expressed as area under the effect curve (AUE) of the beta band, was observed between the CF (50 mg) and XR (75 mg) formulations. Compared with the CF tablet, the XR formulation also produced a much less intense maximum effect and a decrease of 63% in the AUE of nausea normalized by dose. The XR formulation has the same absolute bioavailability and the same central activity as assessed by EEG, but produced less intensive nausea than CF venlafaxine. The present findings suggest that a once-daily dosage regimen should be sufficient. This was confirmed by several clinical trials in depressive patients.

Acute subcortical stroke and early serotonergic modification: a IDAP study.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2007.01985.x	The intensity dependence of the auditory-evoked potentials (IDAP) is inversely related to serotonergic tone. Depression is frequently observed after stroke, associated with cognitive impairment and increased mortality. Aim of this study was to investigate the serotonergic tone in acute stroke patients by IDAP. Consecutive patients with an acute stroke admitted in our stroke unit were evaluated using clinical and instrumental examinations and compared with healthy controls. The IDAP was calculated as the linear amplitude/stimulus intensity function (ASF) slope, by measuring the peak-to-peak amplitude of Nl-P2 on four blocks of different stimulus intensities. Twenty patients were enrolled; 11 had a right brain infarction; nine had depressive symptoms (DS). The ASF slope of the auditory-evoked potentials was markedly increased in stroke patients compared with controls (P = 0.021). Stroke patients with DS had a significant steeper ASF slope than controls (P = 0.017). There was no statistical difference in ASF slope between stroke patients without DS and controls. Post-stroke depression pathophysiology is still debated. Our study suggests that in acute stroke patients with DS, there is a direct involvement of the serotonergic system, regardless the degree of disability and the site of the lesion.

Augmenting serotonin neurotransmission with citalopram modulates emotional expression decoding but not structural encoding of moderate intensity sad facial emotional stimuli: an event-related potential (ERP) investigation.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881108097878	Antidepressants targeting the serotonergic system have been shown to modulate biases in emotional processing. The effects of serotonergic modulation on the temporal course of emotional processing (accruing within milliseconds) are unknown. Furthermore, it is unknown how serotonin affects different stages of facial emotional processing. The current study investigated the effects of acute serotonin augmentation on event-related potential (ERP) measures associated with 'structural encoding' (N170) and emotion 'expression decoding' (N250 and a late slow-wave positive potential [LPP]) of happy and sad facial stimuli, relative to neutral facial stimuli. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, in which 14 healthy male participants completed a facial recognition task under two acute treatment conditions: 1) placebo (PLB) and 2) 20 mg citalopram (CIT). ERP recording were conducted while subjects viewed neutral, happy and sad facial stimuli. Findings indicated that under PLB, the N170 was not modulated by valence (happy or sad versus neutral), but the N250 and LPP were enhanced for processing happy (relative to neutral) faces. Citalopram had no effect on the N170, but it enhanced the LPP for processing sad (relative to neutral) faces. These findings suggest that serotonin enhancement has selective and temporal effects on emotional face processing, with evidence for modulating processes associated with 'expression decoding' but not 'structural encoding'. The enhanced cortical response to perception of moderately intense sad facial expressions following citalopram administration may relate to the cognitive processing of the social relevance or significance of such ambiguous stimuli.

Serotonergic correlation with anger and aggressive behavior in acute stroke patients: an intensity dependence of auditory evoked potentials (IDAP) study.	DOI: 10.1159/000362268	Anger and aggressive behavior (AB) are two of the main post-stroke behavioral manifestations, which could imply both an anger trait (TA) or a state condition of anger (SA). Serotonergic system is thought to play an inhibitory control on aggressive impulse. Nevertheless, whether 5HT has the same role in TA and in SA, is still debated. Intensity dependence of auditory evoked potentials (IDAP) is thought to be inversely related to the central 5HT tone. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in acute stroke patients, the 5HT system involvement in AB by IDAP. Consecutive stroke patients were evaluated and compared with healthy controls. The Spielberger Trait Anger Scale (STAS) was used to assess AB, SA and TA. Patients with AB and TA showed a significantly increased IDAP value, whereas patients with SA had a significantly lower IDAP; this indicates an increased 5HT tone. In acute stroke patients with AB, there is a decreased central 5HT tone. Surprisingly, we found an opposite 5HT feature between patients with TA and those showing SA, suggesting that the hypothesis of aggression based on 5HT deficiency requires further investigations. This might open new strategies in the treatment of post-stroke AB.

Association of functional polymorphisms in NOS1 and NOS3 with loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials.	DOI: 10.1017/S1461145708008420	Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous molecule with neurotransmitter properties that is involved in numerous functions in the central nervous system (CNS), the vascular system and also in macrophages. Haplotypes of NOS1 and NOS3 genes have been shown to be associated with different psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Therefore, the detection of other characteristics of nitrinergic transmission is desirable. Because nitrinergic functioning influences serotonergic transmission, a functional marker of the serotonergic transmission, the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP), can be assumed to be influenced by nitrinergic changes as well. In order to clarify the relationship between nitrinergic transmission and LDAEP, 95 healthy subjects (41 males, 54 females) underwent electrophysiological recording and blood drawing for genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of the NOS1 and NOS3 genes. Interestingly, two functional SNPs in both NOS1 (G-84A_exon 1c promoter polymorphism) and NOS3 (Glu298Asp) were associated with lower LDAEP. Further studies are needed to fully clarify the relationship between nitrinergic transmission, LDAEP and complex disorders such as schizophrenia and affective disorders.

Effects of 5 weeks of administration of fluoxetine and dothiepin in normal volunteers on sleep, daytime sedation, psychomotor performance and mood.	DOI: 10.1177/026988110201600406	This was a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized crossover study of long-term (5 weeks) administration of fluoxetine (20 mg/day) and dothiepin (75 mg/day for 1 week followed by 150 mg/day for 4 weeks) in 12 healthy male volunteers. Subjects were studied on day 10 and day 36 of treatment, with tests of nocturnal sleep, driving performance, continuous electroencephalogram (EEG), sleep during scheduled naps, computerized visual attention tasks, saccadic eye movement measurement and visual analogue ratings of mood. Both drugs had a marked suppressive effect on nocturnal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep; these effects were less at 36 days than at 10 days, and fluoxetine decreased and dothiepin increased REM in daytime naps. Sleep fragmentation after fluoxetine is similar to that reported in the literature. We found no sleep-promoting effects of dothiepin, in contrast to our previous single-dose study, and no subjective sleep effects of either drug. Subjects were less sleepy after both antidepressants than placebo at 5 weeks measured by sleep latencies and EEG. Saccadic eye movement measures were significantly faster after 5 weeks of fluoxetine than after 5 weeks of placebo. Reaction times to a peripheral stimulus during computerized tracking task were shorter after 10 days of dothiepin compared with placebo. Driving performance, visual attention and mood ratings showed no treatment effects. Subjective health reports during each 5 weeks of treatment were similar in number for the two drugs but showed a different profile of side-effects.

The 64-channel EEG and cardiovascular reactivity (beat-by-beat technology) were simultaneously recorded. At rest, hypertensive patients had significantly reduced platelet serotonin concentrations in comparison with healthy individuals. The patients experiencing emotional activation were characterized by significantly lower intensity of positive emotions associated with more pronounced suppression of EEG activity in the delta (2-4 Hz) and theta (ranges of frequency 4-6 and 6-8 Hz) oscillators in the parieto-occipital cortex (zones P and PO) in both hemispheres of the brain.

Brain Network for Exploring the Change of Brain Neurotransmitter 5-Hydroxytryptamine of Autism Children by Resting-State EEG.	DOI: 10.1155/2022/5451277	The study was aimed at understanding the brain network and the change rule of brain neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in autism children through resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG). 20 autistic children in hospital were selected and defined as the observation group. Meanwhile, 20 healthy children were defined as the control group. EEG signals were collected for the two groups. Fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm was used to extract features of EEG signals, and DTF was applied for the causal association between multichannel EEG signals. The two groups were compared for the average function value and regional efficiency of the brain neurotransmitter 5-HT. The results showed that the classification accuracy of frontal F7 channel, left frontal FP1 channel, and temporal T6 channel was 95.2%, 95.3%, and 91.2%, respectively. The average of high beta frequency band, low beta frequency band, theta frequency band, and alpha frequency band in the control group was significantly higher than that in the observation group under the optimal threshold (P < 0.05). Compared with normal subjects (34.27), the average function of 5-HT in the brain was 20.13 in patients with low function and 45.74 in patients with hyperfunction. In conclusion, FCM algorithm can feature extraction of EEG signals, especially in the frontal F7 channel, the left frontal FP1 channel, and the TEMPORAL T6 channel, which has high classification accuracy and can well express the EEG signals of autistic children. The level of 5-HT in autistic children is lower than that in healthy people, and it is closely related to loneliness and depression.

The loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) as an indicator of serotonergic dysfunction in patients with predominant schizophrenic negative symptoms.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0068650	Besides the influence of dopaminergic neurotransmission on negative symptoms in schizophrenia, there is evidence that alterations of serotonin (5-HT) system functioning also play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of these disabling symptoms. From post mortem and genetic studies on patients with negative symptoms a 5-HT dysfunction is documented. In addition atypical neuroleptics and some antidepressants improve negative symptoms via serotonergic action. So far no research has been done to directly clarify the association between the serotonergic functioning and the extent of negative symptoms. Therefore, we examined the status of brain 5-HT level in negative symptoms in schizophrenia by means of the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP). The LDAEP provides a well established and non-invasive in vivo marker of the central 5-HT activity. We investigated 13 patients with schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms treated with atypical neuroleptics and 13 healthy age and gender matched controls with a 32-channel EEG. The LDAEP of the N1/P2 component was evaluated by dipole source analysis and single electrode estimation at Cz. Psychopathological parameters, nicotine use and medication were assessed to control for additional influencing factors. Schizophrenic patients showed significantly higher LDAEP in both hemispheres than controls. Furthermore, the LDAEP in the right hemisphere in patients was related to higher scores in scales assessing negative symptoms. A relationship with positive symptoms was not found. These data might suggest a diminished central serotonergic neurotransmission in patients with predominant negative symptoms.

Electrophysiological assessment of impulsive behavior in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1016/s0028-3932(00)00115-9	The different concepts of impulsivity cover a wide range of divergent behaviors. In clinical terms, aspects of impulsivity are both an important feature in several psychiatric conditions related to a low central serotonergic neurotransmission like aggressive behavior and suicidality, and a core symptom of frontal lobe syndromes of various etiologies. Assessment of the different forms of impulsivity so far relies on clinical observations and self-rating questionnaires. Measurements of a distinct brain function associated with impulsive behavior are not available yet, however, electrophysiological parameters of cognitive response control elicited with the execution (Go-condition) and the inhibition (NoGo-condition) of a prepared motor response within the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) might be suitable candidates. By means of a spatial analysis method the centers of gravity (centroids) of the brain electrical fields evoked with Go- and NoGo-responses can be localized and quantified. In the present study, the Go- and NoGo-centroids and the impulsivity score in Eysenck's I(7)-scale were determined in 22 healthy subjects (10 women, 12 men, mean age 42.0+/-10.1 years). Impulsivity was correlated with both, a more anterior location of the Go- (r=0.58, P<0.01) and the NoGo-centroid (r=0.53, P=0.01). These results indicate, that in healthy subjects the amount of I(7)-impulsivity is associated with differences in the prefrontal brain activation pattern during cognitive response control. However, a replication study with a larger sample and an investigation of psychiatric patients with pathological levels of impulsivity are necessary to qualify these topographical ERP-parameters of cognitive response control as valid measures of the brain electrical basis of impulsive behavior.

We evaluated the safety and pharmacodynamics of the combination of the 5-HT(1A) antagonist lecozotan and the SSRI citalopram in a well-controlled Clinical Pharmacology Unit setting using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria (HSTC), a set of validated decision rules featuring neurological and body temperature measurements, to detect any clinically relevant serotonin toxicity. Forty-three young healthy male subjects were randomized, to 2 parallel double-blind treatment groups following a 10-day citalopram 40 mg run-in period: citalopram 40 mg/lecozotan 10mg or citalopram 40 mg/placebo for 9 days. Overall, the combined administration of active drugs was well tolerated, however, one subject experienced moderate hyperreflexia, tremor of the hands, and sweating of hands and feet after 3 days of combined treatment. The event prompted treatment withdrawal and was regarded as mild serotonin toxicity, as per the HSTC. The onset of the event was around the time of peak plasma concentrations (t(max)) of both lecozotan and citalopram, and its time course corresponds to the well-defined PK profile of lecozotan. No evidence of a PK interaction was detected trough lecozotan and citalopram plasma concentrations analysis. The utility of the HSTC in detecting the non-discrete group of symptoms commonly referred to as ""serotonin toxicity"" was demonstrated in this clinical pharmacology study combining two 5-HT agents in a clinically controlled setting."

Repeated cortisol administration attenuates the EEG response to buspirone in healthy volunteers: evidence for desensitization of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881107078292	It has previously been postulated that the therapeutic effect of antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is mediated by a down-regulation of somatodendritic (presynaptic) 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors with chronic treatment. Animal studies have revealed that repeated administration of corticosteroids similarly down-regulate this receptor. However, it has previously been difficult to explore if this receptor is similarly modulated in man in vivo. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of repeated administration of cortisol to healthy volunteers utilising a novel putative index of somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor function. This method involves the administration of the 5-HT(1A) agonist buspirone and observing the subsequent negative shift in the frequency spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Healthy male volunteers were treated with cortisol 20 mg, or placebo, orally twice daily for 7 days in a double-blind random-order crossover study. After each treatment period volunteers were administered buspirone 30 mg orally prior to EEG recordings. Following a week's treatment with placebo, buspirone led to a negative shift in the EEG frequency spectrum as previously reported. However, following treatment with cortisol, the effect of buspirone was significantly attenuated. This is consistent with corticosteroids having a similar effect on somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors in man as seen in rodents.

Associations between prospective symptom changes and slow-wave activity in patients with Internet gaming disorder: A resting-state EEG study.	DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000006178	The identification of the predictive factors and biological markers associated with treatment-related changes in the symptoms of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) may provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying this condition. Thus, the present study aimed to identify neurophysiological markers associated with symptom changes in IGD patients and to identify factors that may predict symptom improvements following outpatient treatment with pharmacotherapy. The present study included 20 IGD patients (mean age: 22.71 ± 5.47 years) and 29 healthy control subjects (mean age: 23.97 ± 4.36 years); all IGD patients completed a 6-month outpatient management program that included pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Resting-state electroencephalography scans were acquired prior to and after treatment, and the primary treatment outcome was changes in scores on Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT) from pre- to posttreatment. IGD patients showed increased resting-state electroencephalography activity in the delta and theta bands at baseline, but the increased delta band activity was normalized after 6 months of treatment and was significantly correlated with improvements in IGD symptoms. Additionally, higher absolute theta activity at baseline predicted a greater possibility of improvement in addiction symptoms following treatment, even after adjusting for the effects of depressive or anxiety symptoms. The present findings demonstrated that increased slow-wave activity represented a state neurophysiological marker in IGD patients and suggested that increased theta activity at baseline may be a favorable prognostic marker for this population.

EEG microstates as markers of major depressive disorder and predictors of response to SSRIs therapy.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2022.110514	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with abnormal neural activities and brain connectivity. EEG microstate is a voltage topology map that reflects transient activations of the brain network. A limited number of studies on EEG microstate in MDD have focused on differences between patients and healthy controls. However, EEG microstate changes in MDD patients before and after drug treatment have not been evaluated. We assessed EEG microstate characteristics and evaluated changes in brain network dynamics in MDD patients before and after drug treatment.

Absence of EEG correlates of self-referential processing depth in ALS.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0180136	Self-referential processing is a key cognitive process, associated with the serotonergic system and the default mode network (DMN). Decreased levels of serotonin and reduced activations of the DMN observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) suggest that self-referential processing might be altered in patients with ALS. Here, we investigate the effects of ALS on the electroencephalography correlates of self-referential thinking. We find that electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of self-referential thinking are present in healthy individuals, but not in those with ALS. In particular, thinking about themselves or others significantly modulates the bandpower in the medial prefrontal cortex in healthy individuals, but not in ALS patients. This finding supports the view of ALS as a complex multisystem disorder which, as shown here, includes dysfunctional processing of the medial prefrontal cortex. It points towards possible alterations of self-consciousness in ALS patients, which might have important consequences for patients' self-conceptions, personal relations, and decision-making.

Auditory evoked potential could reflect emotional sensitivity and impulsivity.	DOI: 10.1038/srep37683	Emotional sensitivity and impulsivity could cause interpersonal conflicts and neuropsychiatric problems. Serotonin is correlated with behavioral inhibition and impulsivity. This study evaluated whether the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potential (LDAEP), a potential biological marker of central serotonergic activity, could reflect emotional sensitivity and impulsivity. A total of 157 healthy individuals were recruited, who performed LDAEP and Go/Nogo paradigms during electroencephalogram measurement. Barratt impulsivity scale (BIS), Conners' Adult ADHD rating scale (CAARS), and affective lability scale (ALS) were evaluated. Comparison between low and high LDAEP groups was conducted for behavioural, psychological, and event-related potential (ERP) measures. The high LDAEP group showed significantly increased BIS, a subscale of the CAARS, ALS, and false alarm rate of Nogo stimuli compared to the low LDAEP group. LDAEP showed significant positive correlations with the depression scale, ALS scores, subscale of the CAARS and Nogo-P3 amplitude. In the source activity of Nogo-P3, the cuneus, lingual gyrus, and precentral gyrus activities were significantly increased in the high LDAEP group. Our study revealed that LDAEP could reflect emotional sensitivity and impulsivity. LDAEP, an auditory evoked potential could be a useful tool to evaluate emotional regulation.

Augmentation of serotonin enhances pleasant and suppresses unpleasant cortical electrophysiological responses to visual emotional stimuli in humans.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.022	The serotonergic system is one of the major systems targeted in the pharmacological treatment of a wide range of mood disorders including depression; however, little is known about the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the effects of serotonin (5-HT) on affective phenomena including emotional behaviours, mood and emotional processing. The aim of the current study was to investigate how 5-HT acutely modulates steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), heart rate (HR) and verbal ratings associated with the viewing of differently valent emotional images. In a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 17 healthy subjects were tested under two acute treatment conditions: placebo and citalopram (20 mg) (a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, or SSRI). Participants were tested 2 h post treatment whilst viewing 75 images (categorised as pleasant, neutral or unpleasant). Results indicate that under placebo treatment, processing of unpleasant valence [unpleasant (-) neutral images] was associated with decreases in SSVEP amplitude and latency in frontal and occipital cortices, whereas processing of pleasant valence [pleasant (-) neutral images] was associated with amplitude decreases and latency increases within frontal and left temporoparietal cortices. Decreases in both amplitude and latency are both interpreted as surrogate measures of cortical activation or excitation. Citalopram relative to placebo attenuated the electrophysiological activation to unpleasant valence within frontal and occipital cortices, but potentiated electrophysiological activation (amplitude only) to pleasant valence within parietooccipital cortices. Citalopram relative to placebo also suppressed differences in heart rate associated with the viewing of pleasant and unpleasant images, but did not alter subject's subjective responses to emotional images. Results suggest that responsiveness to pleasant and unpleasant stimuli following neurochemical modulation may vary across different response systems (i.e. self-report, HR and SSVEP). Electrophysiological findings suggest that acute serotonergic augmentation with citalopram modulates cortical processing of emotionally valent stimuli such that response to pleasant valence is potentiated and response to unpleasant valence is suppressed. The findings suggest a possible neurophysiological mechanism underlying antidepressant drug action on emotion.

The intensity dependence of auditory evoked potential (IDAP) is considered an index of central serotonergic activity in the auditory cortex. The higher the steepness of the N1/P2 component amplitude-stimulus function slope (N1/P2 ASF slope as calculated by IDAP), the lower the central serotonergic activity. Similarly, the N1 amplitude-stimulus function slope (N1 ASF slope) was investigated.

Serotonergic central tone in Parkinson's disease with fatigue: Evidence from the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP).	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2021.136242	Central fatigue in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and disabling symptom that further worsens the patients' quality of life. A deficit in the serotonergic system may be implicated in the occurrence of fatigue in patients with PD as well as in those with other chronic conditions characterized by fatigue. The loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) is a neurophysiological tool that has proved to be effective in measuring the serotonergic central function in vivo. The aim of the present study was to assess central serotonergic activity in PD patients and to explore its possible association with the presence of fatigue. LDAEP was recorded in 38 PD patients (26 without fatigue - PDnF and 12 with fatigue - PDF) and 34 healthy controls. A significant difference between parkinsonian patients and controls emerged, with patients displaying stronger LDAEP values (which reflect a lower serotonergic central tone) than controls. By contrast, no differences in LDAEP emerged between PDF and PDnF. Our electrophysiological data confirmed the presence of a deficit in serotonergic central transmission in PD. An association between this deficit and fatigue was not demonstrated. It is likely that an altered dopamine/serotonin balance, rather than a serotonin deficit alone, is involved in the genesis of central fatigue. This complex and multifaceted symptom is related above all to a dysfunction in the striato-thalamo-cortical loop that connects the neostriatum to the frontal lobe and is strongly affected by motivation.

Chronic medication does not affect hyperactive error responses in obsessive-compulsive disorder.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2010.00988.x	Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) show an increased error-related negativity (ERN), yet previous studies have not controlled for medication use, which may be important given evidence linking performance monitoring to neurotransmitter systems targeted by treatment, such as serotonin. In an examination of 19 unmedicated OCD patients, 19 medicated OCD patients, 19 medicated patient controls without OCD, and 21 unmedicated healthy controls, we found greater ERNs in OCD patients than in controls, irrespective of medication use. Severity of generalized anxiety and depression was associated with ERN amplitude in controls but not patients. These data confirm previous findings of an exaggerated error response in OCD, further showing that it cannot be attributed to medication. The absence in patients of a relationship between ERN amplitude and anxiety/depression, as was found in controls, suggests that elevated error signals in OCD may be disorder-specific.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of oral and intravenous meta-chlorophenylpiperazine in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1097/00004714-199808000-00007	meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) is a compound that is frequently used in challenge tests of the serotonergic system. Its human pharmacology is largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of mCPP. Eight female and six male healthy volunteers were included in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, three-way crossover design of single-dose intravenous (0.1 mg/kg), oral (0.5 mg/kg), and placebo treatment, with 24-hour follow-up. mCPP showed a large variability in clearance (11-92 mL/hr) and bioavailability (14-108%). Two female subjects dropped out because of headache and dysphoria. During the 27 occasions in which mCPP was administered, autonomic physical symptoms were observed in 23 subjects and disturbances of mood in 6 subjects. Oral and intravenous mCPP caused sudden increases in cortisol levels, prolactin levels, and total scores of the Body Sensation Questionnaire. Administration of mCPP also led to concentration-dependent increases of saccadic peak velocity and adaptive tracking performance and to a decrease of electroencephalographic occipital theta activity. No clinically relevant effects on electrocardiogram, temperature, and blood pressure were found. In conclusion, it is doubtful whether mCPP is a useful compound for challenge tests in view of the large pharmacokinetic variability after intravenous and oral administration. The effects of mCPP are consistent with disinhibition of the central nervous system.

Association between the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials and age in patients with schizophrenia and depression.	DOI: 10.1177/03000605221109789	Although serotonergic dysfunction is significantly associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), comparison of serotonergic dysfunction in both diseases has received little attention. Serotonin hypotheses have suggested diminished and elevated serotonin activity in MDD and SCZ, respectively. However, the foundations underlying these hypotheses are unclear regarding changes in serotonin neurotransmission in the aging brain. The loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) reflects serotonin neurotransmission. The present study compared the LDAEP between patients with SCZ or MDD and healthy controls (HCs). We further examined whether age was correlated with the LDAEP and clinical symptoms.

Event-related brain potentials and working memory function in healthy humans after single-dose and prolonged intranasal administration of adrenocorticotropin 4-10 and desacetyl-alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone.	DOI: 10.1097/00004714-200008000-00009	"Neuropeptides of the adrenocorticotropin/melanocorticotropin (ACTH/MSH) family are most potent modulators of cognitive function. Their neurobehavioral activity is principally encoded in the 4-10 fragment of the ACTH/MSH molecule; in humans, it has been shown to pertain primarily to functions of attentive stimulus/response processing. The aims of this study were (1) to examine the effects of ACTH 4-10 on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and behavioral indicators of stimulus encoding within the working memory; (2) to compare the effects after a single dose and after prolonged treatment with ACTH 4-10; and (3) to compare the effects of ACTH 4-10 with those of desacetyl-alpha-MSH (i.e., ACTH 1-13 amide), which, like ACTH 4-10, binds to the known brain melanocortin receptors (MC-Rs) but with distinctly higher affinity. Double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments were performed in 60 healthy control subjects. The authors monitored ERPs and reaction times while these subjects performed an auditory vigilance task (""oddball""). Recall was tested on a verbal short-term memory task including different word categories (neutral, rare, food, sex). After a single (1 mg) as well as prolonged intranasal administration (1 mg/day over a period of 6 weeks), ACTH 4-10 enhanced the positive slow wave in ERPs to target stimuli of the vigilance task (p < 0.05), but left classic P3 unaffected. Moreover, single-dose and prolonged administration of ACTH 4-10 increased the rate of false responses during vigilance (p < 0.01). In the short term, ACTH 4-10 also impaired recall of neutral words (p < 0.05). Equimolar doses of desacetyl-alpha-MSH did not influence ERPs, neither after a single dose nor after prolonged treatment. Similar to ACTH 4-10, desacetyl-alpha-MSH increased the error rate during vigilance and acutely impaired the recall of neutral words. The increase in ERP slow-wave positivity, in conjunction with behavioral impairments after treatment with ACTH 4-10, complemented previous results of inferior focusing of attention and a less concise structure of thought after administration of ACTH 4-10. The changes indicated an impairment in differential processing of relevant versus irrelevant contents within the working memory, and, in this regard, might mimic aspects of psychopathologic disturbances of attention and thought processes. Their persistence after prolonged treatment with ACTH 4-10 suggests an activation of mechanisms subserving the consolidation of the peptide's effects. The poor efficacy of desacetyl-alpha-MSH suggests that the known MC-Rs may be irrelevant for mediating cognitive effects of this neuropeptide family."

Brain potentials and attention after acute and subchronic intranasal administration ofACTH 4-10 and desacetyl-alpha-MSH in humans.	DOI: 10.1159/000054460	Neuropeptides related to adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) are potent regulators of neurobehavioral functions. In humans, ACTH and its behaviorally active fragment ACTH 4-10 have been consistently found to diminish event-related brain potential (ERP) signs of focussing attention. This study aimed at (1) evaluating effects of ACTH 4-10 on ERP indicators of attention in healthy controls after intranasal administration of the peptide. This route of administration has been proposed to provide a more direct access to the brain than the intravenous administration of the peptide, (2) comparing acute effects and effects of a subchronic treatment with ACTH 4-10, and (3) comparing effects of ACTH 4-10 with those of desacetyl-alpha-MSH (corresponding to ACTH 1-13 amide) which like ACTH 4-10 binds to subgroups of the melanocortin receptor family. Double-blind placebo-controlled experiments were completed in 54 healthy young subjects. ERPs were recorded while the subject performed an auditory selective attention task. Moreover, a modified Stroop interference test including motivational (food, sex) and nonmotivational words was performed. Acute intranasal administration of ACTH 4-10 (1 mg) reduced the processing negativity (PN) of the ERP over frontal and central cortical areas (p < 0.05) indicating diminished focussing of attention. Moreover, on this condition subjects were more prone to interference on the Stroop task especially with motivational words (p < 0.05). Subchronic administration of ACTH 4-10 (1 mg/day over 6 weeks) did not affect PN and Stroop performance. Acute intranasal administration of desacetyl-alpha-MSH at equimolar doses (1.68 mg) also remained ineffective. However, some measures of Stroop performance appeared to improve after subchronic desacetyl-alpha-MSH treatment. Results confirm an acute decrease in focussing of attention after ACTH 4-10. These effects of intranasal administration are likely to reflect a direct action of the peptide on respective brain functions. Moreover, they were specific to ACTH 4-10 and were not obtained after equimolar doses of desacetyl-alpha-MSH, thus excluding a mediation via the known melanocortin receptors.

Characterizing the neurological phenotype of the hyperinsulinism hyperammonemia syndrome.	DOI: 10.1186/s13023-022-02398-3	Hyperinsulinism hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome is caused by activating mutations in GLUD1, encoding glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Atypical absence seizures and neuropsychological disorders occur at high rates in this form of hyperinsulinism. Dysregulated central nervous system (CNS) glutamate balance, due to GDH overactivity in the brain, has been hypothesized to play a role. This study aimed to describe the neurologic phenotype in HI/HA syndrome and investigate CNS glutamate levels using glutamate weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (GluCEST MRI). In this cross-sectional study, 12 subjects with HI/HA syndrome had plasma ammonia measurement, self- or parent-completed neurocognitive assessments, electroencephalogram (EEG), and GluCEST MRI at 7 T performed. GluCEST MRI measures were compared to a historic reference population of 10 healthy adults.

Induced hyperammonemia may compromise the ability to generate restful sleep in patients with cirrhosis.	DOI: 10.1002/hep.24741	In patients with cirrhosis, hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy are common after gastrointestinal bleeding and can be simulated by an amino acid challenge (AAC), or the administration of a mixture of amino acids mimicking the composition of hemoglobin. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical, psychometric, and wake-/sleep-electroencephalogram (EEG) correlates of induced hyperammonemia. Ten patients with cirrhosis and 10 matched healthy volunteers underwent: (1) 8-day sleep quality/timing monitoring; (2) neuropsychiatric assessment at baseline/after AAC; (3) hourly ammonia/subjective sleepiness assessment for 8 hours after AAC; (4) sleep EEG recordings (nap opportunity: 17:00-19:00) at baseline/after AAC. Neuropsychiatric performance was scored according to age-/education-adjusted Italian norms. Sleep stages were scored visually for 20-second epochs; power density spectra were calculated for consecutive 20-second epochs and average spectra determined for consolidated episodes of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep of minimal common length. The AAC resulted in: (i) an increase in ammonia concentrations/subjective sleepiness in both patients and healthy volunteers; (ii) a worsening of neuropsychiatric performance (wake EEG slowing) in two (20%) patients and none of the healthy volunteers; (iii) an increase in the length of non-REM sleep in healthy volunteers [49.3 (26.6) versus 30.4 (15.6) min; P = 0.08]; (iv) a decrease in the sleep EEG beta power (fast activity) in the healthy volunteers; (v) a decrease in the sleep EEG delta power in patients.

Effects of rHuEPO on Q-EEG and event-related potentials in chronic renal failure.	DOI: 10.1038/ki.1993.356	Quantitative electroencephalography is a powerful tool to evaluate brain function, and preliminary data have shown its usefulness in the evaluation of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). In this study, baseline values of different quantitative EEG variables, as well as data from the P300 component of the visual event-related potential, in 43 patients with chronic renal failure, were compared with those of a group of healthy subjects and with the results obtained after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of treatment of these patients with rHuEPO. Baseline total power was much lower in patients with CRF than in healthy subjects, and the distribution of power among the frequency bands was also abnormal. rHuEPO promptly normalized total power and progressively improved power distribution, although full normality was not achieved. Mean dominant frequencies in brain areas were abnormal in patients with CRF, and progressive improvement was seen along the study. The latency of P300, which was increased before treatment, decreased in all subjects, but normal values were not reached. The same applies to the hypomanic and psychopathic scores of psychological tests. Altogether, brain dysfunction of CRF seems to substantially improve by treatment of the anemia with rHuEPO.

Assessing circadian rhythms in propofol PK and PD during prolonged infusion in ICU patients.	DOI: 10.1007/s10928-010-9161-5	This study evaluates possible circadian rhythms during prolonged propofol infusion in patients in the intensive care unit. Eleven patients were sedated with a constant propofol infusion. The blood samples for the propofol assay were collected every hour during the second day, the third day, and after the termination of the propofol infusion. Values of electroencephalographic bispectral index (BIS), arterial blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation and body temperature were recorded every hour at the blood collection time points. A two-compartment model was used to describe propofol pharmacokinetics. Typical values of the central and peripheral volume of distribution and inter-compartmental clearance were V(C) = 27.7 l, V(T) = 801 l, and CL(D) = 2.73 l/min. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found to influence the propofol metabolic clearance according to Cl (l/min) = 2.65 x (1-0.00714 x (SBP-135)). There was no significant circadian rhythm detected with respect to propofol pharmacokinetics. The BIS score was assessed as a direct effect model with EC(50) equal 1.98 mg/l. There was no significant circadian rhythm detected within the BIS scores. We concluded that the light-dark cycle did not influence propofol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in intensive care units patients. The lack of night-day differences was also noted for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and blood oxygenation. Circadian rhythms were detected for heart rate and body temperature, however they were severely disturbed from the pattern of healthy patients.

The clinical, imaging, pathological and genetic landscape of bottom-of-sulcus dysplasia.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awad379	Bottom-of-sulcus dysplasia (BOSD) is increasingly recognized as a cause of drug-resistant, surgically-remediable, focal epilepsy, often in seemingly MRI-negative patients. We describe the clinical manifestations, morphological features, localization patterns and genetics of BOSD, with the aims of improving management and understanding pathogenesis. We studied 85 patients with BOSD diagnosed between 2005-2022. Presenting seizure and EEG characteristics, clinical course, genetic findings and treatment response were obtained from medical records. MRI (3 T) and 18F-FDG-PET scans were reviewed systematically for BOSD morphology and metabolism. Histopathological analysis and tissue genetic testing were performed in 64 operated patients. BOSD locations were transposed to common imaging space to study anatomical location, functional network localization and relationship to normal MTOR gene expression. All patients presented with stereotyped focal seizures with rapidly escalating frequency, prompting hospitalization in 48%. Despite 42% patients having seizure remissions, usually with sodium channel blocking medications, most eventually became drug-resistant and underwent surgery (86% seizure-free). Prior developmental delay was uncommon but intellectual, language and executive dysfunction were present in 24%, 48% and 29% when assessed preoperatively, low intellect being associated with greater epilepsy duration. BOSDs were missed on initial MRI in 68%, being ultimately recognized following repeat MRI, 18F-FDG-PET or image postprocessing. MRI features were grey-white junction blurring (100%), cortical thickening (91%), transmantle band (62%), increased cortical T1 signal (46%) and increased subcortical FLAIR signal (26%). BOSD hypometabolism was present on 18F-FDG-PET in 99%. Additional areas of cortical malformation or grey matter heterotopia were present in eight patients. BOSDs predominated in frontal and pericentral cortex and related functional networks, mostly sparing temporal and occipital cortex, and limbic and visual networks. Genetic testing yielded pathogenic mTOR pathway variants in 63% patients, including somatic MTOR variants in 47% operated patients and germline DEPDC5 or NPRL3 variants in 73% patients with familial focal epilepsy. BOSDs tended to occur in regions where the healthy brain normally shows lower MTOR expression, suggesting these regions may be more vulnerable to upregulation of MTOR activity. Consistent with the existing literature, these results highlight (i) clinical features raising suspicion of BOSD; (ii) the role of somatic and germline mTOR pathway variants in patients with sporadic and familial focal epilepsy associated with BOSD; and (iii) the role of 18F-FDG-PET alongside high-field MRI in detecting subtle BOSD. The anatomical and functional distribution of BOSDs likely explain their seizure, EEG and cognitive manifestations and may relate to relative MTOR expression.

Correlation between fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography brain hypometabolism and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in temporal lobe epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1111/epi.17300	The relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and focal epilepsy is poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that there is a complex and reciprocal potential reinforcement of the symptoms of each condition. In this study, we investigated whether there are PTSD-specific brain changes in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) metabolism was compared between controls and two groups of TLE patients: one group of 15 patients fulfilling the criteria for a potential diagnosis of PTSD (TLE-PTSD+), another group of 24 patients without a diagnosis of PTSD (TLE-PTSD-), and a group of 30 healthy control participants. We compared the differences in brain PET metabolism among these three groups, and we studied their correlations with interictal and peri-ictal scales of PTSD symptoms. TLE-PTSD+ patients showed more significant hypometabolism involving right temporal and right orbitofrontal cortex in comparison to TLE-PTSD- patients and healthy subjects. Moreover, degree of reduced metabolism in these brain areas correlated with interictal and peri-ictal PTSD questionnaire scores. PTSD in temporal epilepsy is associated with specific changes in neural networks, affecting limbic and paralimbic structures. This illustrates the close intertwining of epileptogenic and psychogenic processes in these patients.

Seven patients had negative magnetic resonance imaging. Whole-brain statistical analysis of PET imaging was performed at the voxel level, showing that in comparison to healthy subjects and to epileptic patients without IA, a hypometabolism in the right posterior insula characterized epileptic patients with IA.

Neuropsychological functioning and brain energetics of drug resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients.	DOI: 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2017.10.009	Interictal hypometabolism is commonly measured by 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) in the temporal lobe of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE-HS). Left temporal lobe interictal FDG-PET hypometabolism has been associated with verbal memory impairment, while right temporal lobe FDG-PET hypometabolism is associated with nonverbal memory impairment. The biochemical mechanisms involved in these findings remain unknown. In comparison to healthy controls (n=21), surgically treated patients with MTLE-HS (n=32, left side=17) had significant lower scores in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT retention and delayed), Logical Memory II (LMII), Boston Naming test (BNT), Letter Fluency and Category Fluency. We investigated whether enzymatic activities of the mitochondrial enzymes Complex I (C I), Complex II (C II), Complex IV (C IV) and Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) from the resected samples of the middle temporal neocortex (mTCx), amygdala (AMY) and hippocampus (HIP) were associated with performance in the RAVLT, LMII, BNT and fluency tests of our patients. After controlling for the side of hippocampus sclerosis, years of education, disease duration, antiepileptic treatment and seizure outcome after surgery, no independent associations were observed between the cognitive test scores and the analyzed mitochondrial enzymatic activities (p>0.37). Results indicate that memory and language impairment observed in MTLE-HS patients are not strongly associated with the levels of mitochondrial CI, CII, SDH and C IV enzymatic activities in the temporal lobe structures ipsilateral to the HS lesion.

In vivo imaging of region and cell type specific neocortical neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Perspectives of MRI derived corpus callosum measurement for mapping disease progression and effects of therapy. Evidence from studies with MRI, EEG and PET.	DOI: 10.1007/s007020200069	Neuropathological studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicate specific loss of layer III and V large pyramidal neurons in association cortex. These neurons give rise to long cortico-cortical connections, projecting through the corpus callosum, in an anterior-posterior topology. Based on these findings we hypothesized that regional corpus callosum atrophy may be a potential in vivo marker for neocortical neuronal loss in AD. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a method to measure cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum and of five corpus callosum subregions on midsagittal magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRI). In a subsequent series of six experimental studies using MRI, (18)FDG-PET and EEG, we investigated the relation of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) to corpus callosum size and correlated regional pattern of corpus callosum atrophy with regional cortical metabolic decline as well as intracortical coherencies. Mean total corpus callosum area was reduced significantly in AD patients compared to healthy age-matched controls, with the greatest changes in the rostrum and the splenium and relative sparing of the truncus. The regional pattern of corpus callosum atrophy was independent of WMH load and correlated significantly with pattern of regional metabolic decline measured with (18)FDG-PET, the degree of cognitive impairment and regional decline of bilateral intracortical-coherency in EEG in AD patients. We further found that hippocampus atrophy, as a marker of early allocortical degeneration, was more pronounced than total corpus callosum atrophy in mild stages of AD. Regional corpus callosum atrophy in mild disease, however, suggested early neocortical degeneration in AD. In a longitudinal study, AD patients showed significantly greater rates of corpus callosum atrophy than controls. Rates of atrophy correlated with progression of clinical dementia severity in AD. Our results indicate that regional corpus callosum atrophy in AD patients represents the loss of callosal efferent neurons in corresponding regions of the neocortex. As these neurons are a subset of cortico-cortical projecting neurons, region-specific corpus callosum atrophy may serve as a marker of progressive neocortical disconnection in AD. In combination with measurement of hippocampal atrophy, assessment of corpus callosum atrophy over time in individual patients is useful to evaluate effects on brain structure of currently developed drugs, thought to slow or modify AD progression.

Cortical spreading ischaemia is a novel process involved in ischaemic damage in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awp102	The term cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) describes a wave of mass neuronal depolarization associated with net influx of cations and water. Clusters of prolonged CSDs were measured time-locked to progressive ischaemic damage in human cortex. CSD induces tone alterations in resistance vessels, causing either transient hyperperfusion (physiological haemodynamic response) in healthy tissue; or hypoperfusion [inverse haemodynamic response = cortical spreading ischaemia (CSI)] in tissue at risk for progressive damage, which has so far only been shown experimentally. Here, we performed a prospective, multicentre study in 13 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, using novel subdural opto-electrode technology for simultaneous laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and direct current-electrocorticography, combined with measurements of tissue partial pressure of oxygen (ptiO(2)). Regional cerebral blood flow and electrocorticography were simultaneously recorded in 417 CSDs. Isolated CSDs occurred in 12 patients and were associated with either physiological, absent or inverse haemodynamic responses. Whereas the physiological haemodynamic response caused tissue hyperoxia, the inverse response led to tissue hypoxia. Clusters of prolonged CSDs were measured in five patients in close proximity to structural brain damage as assessed by neuroimaging. Clusters were associated with CSD-induced spreading hypoperfusions, which were significantly longer in duration (up to 144 min) than those of isolated CSDs. Thus, oxygen depletion caused by the inverse haemodynamic response may contribute to the establishment of clusters of prolonged CSDs and lesion progression. Combined electrocorticography and perfusion monitoring also revealed a characteristic vascular signature that might be used for non-invasive detection of CSD. Low-frequency vascular fluctuations (LF-VF) (f < 0.1 Hz), detectable by functional imaging methods, are determined by the brain's resting neuronal activity. CSD provides a depolarization block of the resting activity, recorded electrophysiologically as spreading depression of high-frequency-electrocorticography activity. Accordingly, we observed a spreading suppression of LF-VF, which accompanied spreading depression of high-frequency-electrocorticography activity, independently of whether CSD was associated with a physiological, absent or inverse haemodynamic response. Spreading suppressions of LF-VF thus allow the differentiation of progressive ischaemia and repair phases in a fashion similar to that shown previously for spreading depressions of high-frequency-electrocorticography activity. In conclusion, it is suggested that (i) CSI is a novel human disease mechanism associated with lesion development and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in stroke; and that (ii) prolonged spreading suppressions of LF-VF are a novel 'functional marker' for progressive ischaemia.

Decreased short-latency afferent inhibition in individuals with mild cognitive impairment: A TMS-EEG study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2024.110967	TMS combined with EEG (TMS-EEG) is a tool to characterize the neurophysiological dynamics of the cortex. Among the TMS paradigms, short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) allows the investigation of inhibitory effects mediated by the cholinergic system. The aim of this study was to compare cholinergic function in the DLPFC between individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls (HC) using TMS-EEG with the SAI paradigm. In this study, 30 MCI and 30 HC subjects were included. The SAI paradigm consisted of 80 single pulse TMS and 80 SAI stimulations applied to the left DLPFC. N100 components, global mean field power (GMFP) and total power were calculated. As a result, individuals with MCI showed reduced inhibitory effects on N100 components and GMFP at approximately 100 ms post-stimulation and on β-band activity at 200 ms post-stimulation compared to HC. Individuals with MCI showed reduced SAI, suggesting impaired cholinergic function in the DLPFC compared to the HC group. We conclude that these findings underscore the clinical applicability of the TMS-EEG method as a powerful tool for assessing cholinergic function in individuals with MCI.

Normalized Theta but Increased Gamma Activity after Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Treatment in Alzheimer's Disease: Preliminary qEEG Study.	DOI: 10.1177/15500594221120723	Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-I) are the core treatment of mild to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the efficacy of AChE-I treatment on electroencephalography (EEG) and cognition remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the EEG power and coherence changes, in addition to neuropsychological performance, following a one-year treatment. Nine de-novo AD patients and demographically-matched healthy controls (HC) were included. After baseline assessments, all AD participants started cholinergic therapy. We found that baseline and follow-up gamma power analyzes were similar between groups. Yet, within the AD group after AChE-I intake, individuals with AD displayed higher gamma power compared to their baselines (P < .039). Also, baseline gamma coherence analysis showed lower values in the AD than in HC (P < .048), while these differences disappeared with increased gamma values of AD patients at the follow-up. Within the AD group after AChE-I intake, individuals with AD displayed higher theta and alpha coherence compared to their baselines (all, P < .039). These increased results within the AD group may result from a subclinical epileptiform activity. Even though AChE-I is associated with lower mortality, our results showed a significant effect on EEG power yet can increase the subclinical epileptiform activity. It is essential to be conscious of the seizure risk that treatment may cause.

EEG alpha reactivity and cholinergic system integrity in Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

Acute separate and combined effects of cannabinoid and nicotinic receptor agonists on MMN-indexed auditory deviance detection in healthy humans.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pbb.2019.172739	The high prevalence of concomitant cannabis and nicotine use has implications for sensory and cognitive processing. While nicotine tends to enhance function in these domains, cannabis use has been associated with both sensory and cognitive impairments, though the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Additionally, the interaction of the nicotinic (nAChR) and cannabinoid (CB1) receptor systems has received limited study in terms of sensory/cognitive processes. This study involving healthy volunteers assessed the acute separate and combined effects of nabilone (a CB1 agonist) and nicotine on sensory processing as assessed by auditory deviance detection and indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential. It was hypothesized that nabilone would impair auditory discriminability as shown by diminished MMN amplitudes, but not when administered in combination with nicotine. 20 male non-smokers and non-cannabis-users were assessed using a 5-stimulus 'optimal' multi-feature MMN paradigm within a randomized, placebo controlled design (placebo; nabilone [0.5 mg]; nicotine [6 mg]; and nicotine + nabilone). Treatment effects were region- and deviant-dependent. At the temporal regions (mastoid sites), MMN was reduced by nabilone and nicotine separately, whereas co-administration resulted in no impairment. At the frontal region, MMN was enhanced by co-administration of nicotine and nabilone, with no MMN effects being found with separate treatment. These neural effects have relevance for sensory/cognitive processes influenced by separate and simultaneous use of cannabis and tobacco and may have treatment implications for disorders associated with sensory dysfunction and impairments in endocannabinoid and nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission.

Nicotine increases sleep spindle activity.	DOI: 10.1111/jsr.12800	Studies have shown that both nicotine and sleep spindles are associated with enhanced memorisation. Further, a few recent studies have shown how cholinergic input through nicotinic and muscarinic receptors can trigger or modulate sleep processes in general, and sleep spindles in particular. To better understand the interaction between nicotine and sleep spindles, we compared in a single blind randomised study the characteristics of sleep spindles in 10 healthy participants recorded for 2 nights, one with a nicotine patch and one with a sham patch. We investigated differences in sleep spindle duration, amplitude, intra-spindle oscillation frequency and density (i.e. spindles per min). We found that under nicotine, spindles are more numerous (average increase: 0.057 spindles per min; 95% confidence interval: [0.025-0.089]; p = .0004), have higher amplitude (average amplification: 0.260 μV; confidence interval: [0.119-0.402]; p = .0032) and last longer (average lengthening: 0.025 s; confidence interval: [0.017-0.032]; p = 2.7e-11). These results suggest that nicotine can increase spindle activity by acting on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and offer an attractive hypothesis for common mechanisms that may support memorisation improvements previously reported to be associated with nicotine and sleep spindles.

Changes in electrophysiological markers of cognitive control after administration of galantamine.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nicl.2018.07.019	The healthy brain is able to maintain a stable balance between bottom-up sensory processing and top-down cognitive control. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine plays a substantial role in this. Disruption of this balance could contribute to symptoms occurring in psychosis, including subtle disruption of motor control and aberrant appropriation of salience to external stimuli; however the pathological mechanisms are poorly understood. On account of the role beta oscillations play in mediating cognitive control, investigation of beta oscillations is potentially informative about such mechanisms. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate the effect of the acetylcholinesterase-inhibitor, galantamine, on beta oscillations within the sensorimotor region during both a sensorimotor task and a relevance-modulation task in healthy participants, employing a double blind randomized placebo controlled cross-over design. In the galantamine condition, we found a significant reduction in the post-movement beta rebound in the case of executed movements and also in a planned but not executed movement. In the latter case, the effect was significantly greater following task-relevant compared with irrelevant stimuli. The results suggest that the action of galantamine reduces the influence of top-down cognitive processing relative to bottom-up perceptual processing in a manner resembling changes previously reported in schizophrenia.

Encephalography Connectivity on Sources in Male Nonsmokers after Nicotine Administration during the Resting State.	DOI: 10.1159/000450711	We present an encephalography (EEG) connectivity study where 30 healthy male nonsmokers were randomly allocated either to a nicotine group (14 subjects, 7 mg of transdermal nicotine) or to a placebo group. EEG activity was recorded in an eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) condition before and after drug administration. This is a reanalysis of a previous dataset. Through a source reconstruction procedure, we extracted 13 time series representing 13 sources belonging to a resting-state network. Here, we conducted connectivity analysis (renormalized partial directed coherence; rPDC) on sources, focusing on the frequency range of 8.5-18.4 Hz, subdivided into 3 frequency bands (α1, α2, and β1) with the hypothesis that an increase in vigilance would modulate connectivity. Furthermore, a phase-amplitude coupling (mean resultant vector length; VL) analysis, was performed investigating whether an increase of vigilance would modulate phase-amplitude coupling. In the VL analysis we estimated the coupling of the phases of 3 low frequencies (α1, α2, and β1), respectively, with the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations (30-40 Hz, low γ). With rPDC we found that during the EC condition, nicotine decreased feedback connectivity (from the precentral gyrus to precuneus, angular gyrus, cuneus and superior occipital gyrus) at 10.5-12.4 Hz. The VL analysis showed nicotine-induced increases in coupling at 10.5-18.4 Hz in the precuneus, cuneus and superior occipital gyrus during the EC condition. During the EO condition, no significant results were found in connectivity or phase-amplitude coupling measures at any frequency range. In conclusion, the results suggest that nicotine potentially increases the level of vigilance in the EC condition.

When EMG contamination does not necessarily hide high-frequency EEG: scalp electrical recordings before and after Dysport injections.	DOI: 10.1007/s00221-016-4708-3	The main aim of the present study was to investigate effects of partial reductions of electromyogram (EMG) on high-frequency scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) at rest and during performance of certain cognitive tasks. Nineteen healthy women performed the same cognitive tasks before and after cosmetic injections of Dysport in certain sites of facial muscles. Scalp EEG and EMG were recorded. Impact of Dysport injections on changes of spectral power in β2 and low γ frequency ranges (18-40 Hz) in EEG and EMG derivations was investigated. Also changes of spectral power in EEG and EMG derivations during comparisons of different cognitive states were calculated before and after Dysport injections separately. Dysport injections led to EMG decreases in facial muscles around the injection zones and also led to reductions of power of electric processes in scalp derivations. Along with it results of EEG power comparisons between the pairs of the cognitive states were qualitatively similar before and after Dysport injections. These facts to all appearance demonstrate that though scalp EEGs in the range above 15-40 Hz are contaminated by EMG, in certain experimental situations EMG contamination does not preclude qualitative detections of electroencephalographic correlates of mental activities in β2 and low γ frequency ranges. Parallel EEG and EMG registrations can help not to overestimate EMG contamination in psychophysiological EEG studies.

EEG Source Reconstruction in Male Nonsmokers after Nicotine Administration during the Resting State.	DOI: 10.1159/000445481	Modern psychopharmacological research in humans focuses on how specific psychoactive molecules modulate oscillatory brain activity. We present state-of-the-art EEG methods applied in a resting-state drug study. Thirty healthy male nonsmokers were randomly allocated either to a nicotine group (14 subjects, 7 mg transdermal nicotine) or a placebo group (16 subjects). EEG activity was recorded in eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions before and after drug administration. A source reconstruction (minimum norm algorithm) analysis was conducted within a frequency range of 8.5-18.4 Hz subdivided into three different frequency bands. During EO, nicotine reduced the power of oscillatory activity in the 12.5- to 18.4-Hz frequency band in the left middle frontal gyrus. In contrast, in the EC condition, nicotine reduced the power in the 8.5- to 10.4-Hz frequency band in the superior frontal gyri and in the 10.5- to 12.4-Hz and 12.5- to 18.4-Hz frequency bands in the supplementary motor areas. In summary, nicotine reduced the power of the 12.5- to 18.4-Hz band in the left middle frontal gyrus during EO, and it reduced power from 8.5 to 18.4 Hz in a brain area spanning from the superior frontal gyri to the supplementary motor areas during EC. In conclusion, the results suggest that nicotine counteracts the phenomenon of anteriorization of α activity, hence potentially increasing the level of vigilance.

Acetylcholine modulates human working memory and subsequent familiarity based recognition via alpha oscillations.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.05.049	Working memory (WM) can be defined as the ability to maintain and process physically absent information for a short period of time. This vital cognitive function has been related to cholinergic neuromodulation and, in independent work, to theta (4-8Hz) and alpha (9-14Hz) band oscillations. However, the relationship between both aspects remains unclear. To fill this apparent gap, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and a within-subject design in healthy humans who either received the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine (8mg) or a placebo before they performed a Sternberg WM paradigm. Here, sequences of sample images were memorized for a delay of 5s in three different load conditions (two, four or six items). On the next day, long-term memory (LTM) for the images was tested according to a remember/know paradigm. As a main finding, we can show that both theta and alpha oscillations scale during WM maintenance as a function of WM load; this resembles the typical performance decrease. Importantly, cholinergic stimulation via galantamine administration slowed down retrieval speed during WM and reduced associated alpha but not theta power, suggesting a functional relationship between alpha oscillations and WM performance. At LTM, this pattern was accompanied by impaired familiarity based recognition. These findings show that stimulating the healthy cholinergic system impairs WM and subsequent recognition, which is in line with the notion of a quadratic relationship between acetylcholine levels and cognitive functions. Moreover, our data provide empirical evidence for a specific role of alpha oscillations in acetylcholine dependent WM and associated LTM formation.

The separate and combined effects of monoamine oxidase A inhibition and nicotine on resting state EEG.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881115613518	While nicotine is often associated with the neuropsychological effects of tobacco smoke, the robust monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition observed in chronic smokers is also likely to play a role. Electroencephalographically-indexed alterations in baseline neural oscillations by nicotine have previously been reported in both smokers and non-smokers, however, little is known about the effects of MAO inhibition in combination with nicotine on resting state EEG. In a sample of 24 healthy non-smoking males, the effects of 6 mg nicotine gum, as well as MAO-A inhibition via 75 mg moclobemide, were investigated in separate and combined conditions over four separate test sessions. Drug effects were observed in the alpha2, beta2, and theta band frequencies. Nicotine increased alpha2 power, and moclobemide decreased beta2 power. Theta power was decreased most robustly by the combination of both drugs. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the nicotinic and MAO inhibiting properties of tobacco may differentially influence fast-wave oscillations (alpha2 and beta2), while acting in synergy to influence theta oscillations.

Modulation of auditory deviance detection by acute nicotine is baseline and deviant dependent in healthy nonsmokers: a mismatch negativity study.	DOI: 10.1002/hup.2418	Cognitive enhancement resulting from nicotinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation may be evidenced by increased efficiency of the auditory-frontal cortex network of auditory discrimination, which is impaired in schizophrenia, a cognitive disorder associated with excessive tobacco use.

The effect of enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission by nicotine on EEG indices of inhibition in the human brain.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pbb.2014.03.019	The role of the cholinergic system in inhibition remains to be elucidated. Nicotine is a potent tool to augment this system, but most studies investigated its effects solely on behavior. Reference to brain activity is important to specifically identify inhibition-related mechanisms. In the current study the objective was to elucidate the role of the cholinergic system in inhibition. 16 healthy non-smokers performed in a stop task while EEG was recorded. A pre- versus post-treatment, within subjects, placebo controlled, single-blind design was used. It was hypothesized that nicotine would decrease stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) and increase the amplitude of inhibition-related event related potentials, the stop N2 and stop P3. Behavioral measures show nicotine shortened SSRT, but only when pretreatment values were not taken into account. On EEG measures, an enhanced stop P3 under nicotine was found, but only in a subsample sensitive to nicotine based on diastolic blood pressure. The results are indicative of enhanced inhibitory activity possibly reflecting enhanced activation in the superior frontal gyrus.

Effects of acute nicotine on prepulse inhibition of auditory change-related cortical responses.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bbr.2013.07.045	Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle is a measure of inhibitory function in which a weak leading stimulus suppresses the startle response to an intense stimulus. Usually, startle blink reflexes to an intense sound are used for measuring PPI. A recent magnetoencephalographic study showed that a similar phenomenon is observed for auditory change-related cortical response (Change-N1m) to an abrupt change in sound features. It has been well established that nicotine enhances PPI of startle. Therefore, in the present magnetoencephalographic study, the effects of acute nicotine on PPI of the Change-N1m were studied in 12 healthy subjects (two females and 10 males) under a repeated measures and placebo-controlled design. Nicotine (4 mg) was given as nicotine gum. The test Change-N1m response was elicited with an abrupt increase in sound pressure by 6 dB in a continuous background sound of 65 dB. PPI was produced by an insertion of a prepulse with a 3-dB-louder or 6-dB-weaker sound pressure than the background 75 ms before the test stimulus. Results show that nicotine tended to enhance the test Change-N1m response and significantly enhanced PPI for both prepulses. Therefore, nicotine's enhancing effect on PPI of the Change-N1m was similar to that on PPI of the startle. The present results suggest that the two measures share at least some mechanisms.

Nicotine effects on anterior cingulate cortex in schizophrenia and healthy smokers as revealed by EEG-informed fMRI.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2012.09.005	Nicotine can have beneficial effects on attention performance and corresponding brain function in both schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, but it remains controversial whether nicotine affects brain function differentially in patients vs. controls. The effects of nicotine on brain activity elicited by attention-requiring oddball-type tasks have not been studied in schizophrenia patients. In this study we sought to investigate the impact of nicotine on the p300 evoked potential component and corresponding fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) activation measures in schizophrenia patients and controls. Applying a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design, the effects of 1mg nasal nicotine on brain activity elicited by a visual oddball-type task in N=14 schizophrenia and N=15 control smokers were studied with simultaneous EEG-fMRI. EEG single trial amplitudes were used to inform the fMRI analysis. We found a nicotine-associated increase in P300-informed fMRI activation in schizophrenia patients and controls, mainly in the anterior cingulate and adjacent medial frontal cortex. No group differences in the response to nicotine were found. Remarkably, averaged EEG and fMRI activation measures considered in isolation were largely unaffected by nicotine. Taken together, the effects of nicotine on P300 amplitude-associated brain activation do not seem to be fundamentally different in schizophrenic smokers and healthy controls.

Separate and combined effects of low dose ketamine and nicotine on behavioural and neural correlates of sustained attention.	DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.06.012	Given the cognitive-promoting properties of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (nAChR) agonist, nicotine, the increased prevalence of smoke-inhaled nicotine in schizophrenia has been interpreted as an attempt to self-correct cognitive deficits, which have been particularly pronounced in the attentional domain. As glutamatergic abnormalities have been implicated in these attentional deficiencies, this study attempted to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and nAChR systems in the modulation of attention by investigating, in healthy volunteers, the separate and combined effects of nicotine and the NMDAR antagonist ketamine on neural and behavioural responses in a sustained attention task. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, performance and the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) in a visual information processing (RVIP) task were examined in 20 smokers and 20 non-smokers (both male and female). Assessment involved intravenous injection of a low subperceptual bolus dose (.04mg/kg) of ketamine or placebo, which was accompanied by acute treatment with nicotine (4mg) or placebo gum. Nicotine-enhanced attentional processing was most evident in nonsmokers, with both performance accuracy and P300 amplitude measures. Ketamine's detrimental effects on these behavioural and electrophysiologic measures were negatively moderated by acute nicotine, the synergistic effects being expressed differently in smokers and nonsmokers. These findings support the view that acute alterations and individual differences in nAChR function can moderate even subtle glutamatergic-driven cognitive deficiencies in schizophrenia and can be important therapeutic targets for treating cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.

Electroencephalogram, cognitive state, psychological disorders, clinical symptom, and oxidative stress in horticulture farmers exposed to organophosphate pesticides.	DOI: 10.1177/0748233711407243	The aim of this paper was to study the toxicity of organophosphate (OP) pesticides in exposed farmers for electroencephalography, cognitive state, psychological disorders, clinical symptom, oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase, and DNA damage. A comparative cross-sectional analysis was carried out in 40 horticulture farmers who were exposed to OPs in comparison to a control group containing 40 healthy subjects with the same age and sex and education level. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase, DNA damage, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total thiol molecules, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were measured in the blood of subjects. Clinical examination and complete blood test were undertaken in order to record any abnormal sign or symptoms. Cognitive function, psychological symptoms, and psychological distress were examined and recorded. Comparing with controls, the farmers showed higher blood levels of SOD and LPO while their TAC decreased. Farmers showed clinical symptoms such as eczema, breathing muscle weakness, nausea, and saliva secretion. Regarding cognitive function, the orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language were not significantly different in farmers and controls. Among examinations for psychological distress, only labeled somatization was significantly higher in farmers. The present findings indicate that oxidative stress and inhibition of AChE can be seen in chronically OP-exposed people but incidence of neuropsychological disorders seems a complex multivariate phenomenon that might be seen in long-term high-dose exposure situations. Use of supplementary antioxidants would be useful in the treatment of farmers.

Human θ burst stimulation enhances subsequent motor learning and increases performance variability.	DOI: 10.1093/cercor/bhq231	Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) transiently increases motor cortex excitability in healthy humans by a process thought to involve synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP), and this is enhanced by nicotine. Acquisition of a ballistic motor task is likewise accompanied by increased excitability and presumed intracortical LTP. Here, we test how iTBS and nicotine influences subsequent motor learning. Ten healthy subjects participated in a double-blinded placebo-controlled trial testing the effects of iTBS and nicotine. iTBS alone increased the rate of learning but this increase was blocked by nicotine. We then investigated factors other than synaptic strengthening that may play a role. Behavioral analysis and modeling suggested that iTBS increased performance variability, which correlated with learning outcome. A control experiment confirmed the increase in motor output variability by showing that iTBS increased the dispersion of involuntary transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked thumb movements. We suggest that in addition to the effect on synaptic plasticity, iTBS may have facilitated performance by increasing motor output variability; nicotine negated this effect on variability perhaps via increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in cerebral cortex.

A comparative analysis of sensory visual evoked oscillations with visual cognitive event related oscillations in Alzheimer's disease.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.07.036	We compared visual evoked oscillatory responses of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n=22) to healthy elderly controls (n=19) elicited by simple light stimuli. The visual evoked oscillatory responses in AD subjects without cholinergic treatment (n=11) show significant differences (df=2.38, F=4.957, P=0.012) from the controls and the AD subjects treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor (n=11). Higher theta oscillatory responses in untreated AD subjects are seen on the electrode locations over bi-parietal and right occipital regions after simple light stimuli with less, if any, cognitive load. These changes were restricted to the theta frequency range only and are related to location, frequency bands and drug effects. In our previous work we observed that visual event related oscillations elicited after the visual stimuli with a higher cognitive load, i.e. an oddball target, display lower amplitudes: between controls and AD subjects in delta frequency band without a drug effect, over the left and mid-central region. These differences between the visual evoked oscillations and the visual event related oscillations imply that there are at least two different cognitive circuits that are activated upon visual stimuli in AD patients.

White-matter lesions along the cholinergic tracts are related to cortical sources of EEG rhythms in amnesic mild cognitive impairment.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.20612	Does impairment of cholinergic systems represent an important factor in the development of amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), as a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Here we tested the hypothesis that electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms, known to be modulated by the cholinergic system, may be particularly affected in aMCI patients with lesions along the cholinergic white-matter tracts. Eyes-closed resting EEG data were recorded in 28 healthy elderly (Nold) and 57 aMCI patients. Lesions along the cholinergic white-matter tracts were detected with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences on magnetic resonance imaging. The estimation of the cholinergic lesion was performed with a validated semi-automatic algorithm pipeline after registration to a stereotactic template, image integration with stereotactic masks of the cholinergic tracts, and normalization to intracranial volume. The aMCI patients were divided into two groups of high (MCI Ch+; N = 29; MMSE = 26.2) and low cholinergic damage (MCI Ch-; N = 28; MMSE = 26.6). EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). Cortical EEG generators were estimated by LORETA software. As main results, (i) power of occipital, parietal, temporal, and limbic alpha 1 sources was maximum in Nold, intermediate in MCI Ch-, and low in MCI Ch+ patients; (ii) the same trend was true in theta sources. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that damage to the cholinergic system is associated with alterations of EEG sources in aMCI subjects.

Does EEG (visual and quantitative) reflect mental impairment in subcortical vascular dementia?	DOI: 10.1016/j.jns.2007.01.046	The aim of this study was to determine if the results of visual and quantitative EEG (QEEG) parameters reveal a correlation with mental impairment in subcortical vascular dementia (SVD), one of the most frequent causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly. In SVD, like in Alzheimer's disease disturbances were found in cholinergic transmission. The cholinergic deficit as manifested in changes of synaptic potentials is reflected in EEG signals.

Increased frontal phase-locking of event-related theta oscillations in Alzheimer patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2006.07.006	This is a pilot study describing event-related oscillations in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia (AD). Theta responses of 22 mild probable AD subjects according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (11 non-treated, 11 treated by cholinesterase inhibitors), and 20 healthy elderly controls were analyzed by using the conventional visual oddball paradigm. We aimed to compare theta responses of the three groups in a range between 4-7 Hz at the frontal electrodes. At F(3) location, theta responses of healthy subjects were phase locked to stimulation and theta oscillatory responses of non-treated Alzheimer patients showed weaker phase-locking, i.e. average of Z-transformed means of correlation coefficients between single trials was closer to zero. In treated AD patients, phase-locking following target stimulation was two times higher in comparison to the responses of non-treated patients. The results indicate that the phase-locking of theta oscillations at F(3) in the treated patients is as strong as the control subjects. The F(4) theta responses were not statistically significant between the groups. Our findings imply that the theta responses at F(3) location are highly unstable in comparison to F(4) in non-treated mild AD patients and cholinergic agents may modulate event-related theta oscillatory activities in the frontal regions.

Nicotinic modulation of human auditory sensory memory: Evidence from mismatch negativity potentials.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2005.07.014	Impairment in mismatch negativity (MMN) generation is a robust biological marker of schizophrenia. Understanding the physiological and pharmacological processes involved in its generation may therefore advance our understanding of this complex disorder. The present study tested if acute administration of nicotine modulates human auditory sensory memory as measured with MMN. ERP responses to tone duration deviants were recorded using a stimulation protocol with continuously changing (roving) standard stimuli in order to measure the effect of stimulus repetitions on encoding of new stimuli (MMN memory trace effect). Twenty healthy adult volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either a nicotine gum or placebo after a baseline ERP recording. Nicotine administration augmented MMN amplitude in the treatment group compared to the baseline recording, while no MMN change was found in the placebo group. The drug effect was due to a selective enhancement of a frontal positive potential to standard stimuli (from 80-200 ms post-stimulus), while the negativity to deviants remained unaffected. Furthermore, under nicotine stimulation this repetition positivity showed a more marked increase with stimulus repetition compared to baseline and placebo. These results have potential implications for schizophrenia by suggesting that nicotinic agonists could ameliorate patients' MMN deficits by improving stimulus encoding and sensory memory trace formation.

Low-dose atropine amplifies cardiac vagal modulation and increases dynamic baroreflex function in humans.	DOI: 10.1016/j.autneu.2004.12.001	It has been previously known that low-dose atropine (LDA) enhances vagal outflow to the heart. To demonstrate the importance of vagal cardiac modulation in arterial blood pressure (ABP) stability, we evaluated the effect of vagal cardiac stimulation with administration of LDA on ABP fluctuation during dynamic hypertensive and hypotensive stimuli. We assessed changes in RR interval (RRI), ABP, power spectral densities of heart rate variability (HRV) and ABP variability, and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in 16 healthy volunteers before and after administration of LDA (2 microg/kg). Transient hypertension was induced by phenylephrine (2 microg/kg), whereas hypotension was induced by bilateral thigh cuff deflation after a 3-min suprasystolic occlusion. LDA elicited bradycardia and significantly increased high-frequency (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz) power of HRV and spontaneous BRS, as determined by transfer function analysis. The increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) after phenylephrine administration was significantly attenuated by LDA (16+/-2 to 11+/-3 mmHg, P<0.005) and was associated with the augmented reflex bradycardia, whereas the decrease in SBP after cuff deflation was not affected (14+/-5 to 13+/-5 mmHg) with the augmented reflex tachycardia. Increases of HF HRV were correlated significantly and negatively with the increased SBP induced by phenylephrine before and after LDA (r=-0.502, P<0.05). These data suggest that the increased vagal cardiac function induced by LDA augments HR buffering effects, and is important in minimizing arterial pressure fluctuation during dynamic hypertensive stimuli.

Effects of cigarette smoking on cognitive processing.	DOI: 10.1080/00207450490270668	Several previous studies have reported that cigarette smoking enhances performance of cognitive processing. These enhancements are generally attributed to the pharmacological effects of nicotine, while there is some debate whether the effects of smoking/nicotine are a result of recovery from abstinence. Evoked potentials (EPs) and event related potentials (ERPs) of the brain have been applied as an index of information processing in a wide variety of normal and cognitive impaired subjects. This study was carried out on 20 healthy students (23 +/- 2.3 years old) from the medical faculty of City University. Study population comprised ten chronic cigarette smokers consuming an average of 14 +/- 4.2 cigarettes per day, with a history of smoking for more than one year. Ten non -smokers served as control. Standard oddball paradigm was presented, and EEG activity was recorded at the Fz, Cz, Pz electrode sites. Twenty responses to target stimuli were averaged at each location. N1, P2, N2, and P300 components were evaluated in these recordings. Amplitudes were measured relative to prestimulus baseline, and peak latencies were defined as the time point of maximum amplitude. It was found that there were no significant differences between either N1, P2, N2, P300 amplitudes or peak latency values of cigarette smokers and non smokers. As a result, chronic cigarette smoking generally does not improve cognitive processing.

Greater quinidine-induced QTc interval prolongation in women.

Women are at greater risk than men for development of this adverse event when taking drugs that prolong the QT interval.

Brain-gut response to stress and cholinergic stimulation in irritable bowel syndrome. A preliminary study.	DOI: 10.1097/00004836-199309000-00009	To investigate the influence of the brain-gut interactions on the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), we compared such patients (n = 10) with healthy control subjects (n = 11) by measuring the pressure of the colon and small intestine simultaneously with analysis of power spectrum of the electroencephalography (EEG) under mental stress and administration of neostigmine. Stress slightly increased the colonic motility index, reduced the percentage of alpha power, and increased the percentage of beta and theta power of the EEG in the patients with IBS more than in the controls (p < 0.05). The patients with IBS had a longer phase II (p < 0.01) and shorter phase I (p < 0.02) of fasting duodenal motor activity than the controls. Neostigmine (10 micrograms/kg) caused a significant difference in the colonic motility index (p < 0.01) and power spectra of EEG (p < 0.05) in the patients with IBS compared to the controls. Significant positive correlation was detected between colonic motility and power spectral change induced by stress (r = 0.46, p < 0.05) or neostigmine (r = 0.51, p < 0.01). These results suggest that patients with IBS have exaggerated responsivity of the gut and the brain to mental stress and cholinergic stimulation. Moreover, there is a possibility that these exaggerated responses are related.

Effect of the cholinesterase inhibiting substance galanthamine on human EEG and visual evoked potentials.	DOI: 10.1016/0013-4694(92)90050-r	The action of galanthamine (GAL), a cholinesterase inhibiting substance, on resting EEG and on flash visual evoked potentials (VEPs) was tested in 9 healthy subjects. Alpha power was increased significantly in 4 of 8 subjects after the infusion of 10 mg, which provided a median inhibition of 47% of acetylcholinesterase in erythrocytes. Mean alpha frequency and peak alpha frequency decreased significantly in 5 of the 8 subjects by 0.22-0.98 Hz. Alpha power increase and alpha frequency decrease were not accompanied by changes in theta power. The amplitudes of the late components of the flash VEP were increased in 8 of 9 subjects receiving doses of 10-35 mg of GAL, while the early components remained unaffected. Increase of late VEP components was significantly correlated with the strength of cholinesterase inhibition. The synchronizing effect of GAL in these healthy volunteers obviously contrasts with the known desynchronizing effect of physostigmine in animal experiments.

A putative social chemosignal elicits faster cortical responses than perceptually similar odorants.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.10.040	Social chemosignals, so-called pheromones, have recently attracted much attention in that effects on women's psychophysiology and cortical processing have been reported. We here tested the hypothesis that the human brain would process a putative social chemosignal, the endogenous steroid androstadienone, faster than other odorants with perceptually matched intensity and hedonic characteristics. Chemosensory event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded in healthy women. ERP analyses indicate that androstadienone was processed significantly faster than the control odorants. Androstadienone elicited shorter latencies for all recorded ERP components but most so for the late positivity. This finding indicates that androstadienone is processed differently than other related odorants, suggesting the possibility of a specific neuronal subsystem to the main olfactory pathway akin to the one previously reported in Old-world monkeys and emotional visual stimuli in humans.

Electroencephalographic characterization of brain dopaminergic stimulation by apomorphine in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1159/000026560	Apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist (given in a dose of 0.75 mg s.c.), was administered to 8 healthy volunteers; electroencephalograph (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) mapping were performed before dosing and 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 h after dosing. Apomorphine caused an overall increase in beta activity at time 0.5 h in both absolute and relative energy; P300 and CNV ERPs were not significantly altered, although a tendency towards increased P300 latency was seen. The results confirm that the EEG mapping technique is sufficiently sensitive to monitor dopaminergic neurochemical stimulation by means of apomorphine. This could lead to a new, non-invasive and repeatable method for monitoring central neuronal systems which is more convenient to apply repeatedly than for example positron emission tomography techniques. Furthermore, electrophysiological techniques undoubtedly constitute an alternative to classical neuroendocrinological methods, allowing a more direct assessment of central nervous system neurotransmission. Finally, these EEG approaches could lead to better characterization of drugs acting on dopaminergic pathways, such as antipsychotics.

Somatosensory evoked potentials at rest and during movement in Parkinson's disease: evidence for a specific apomorphine effect on the frontal N30 wave.	DOI: 10.1016/0168-5597(94)90133-3	"Studies attempting to relate the abnormalities of the frontal N30 components of the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) have shown contradictory results. We recorded the frontal and parietal SEPs to median nerve stimulation in 2 groups of PD patients: a group of 17 patients presenting the wearing-off phenomenon, and a group of 10 untreated PD patients. The results were compared with a group of 13 healthy volunteers of the same age and with a group of 10 non-parkinsonian patients. All parkinsonian and non-parkinsonian patients were studied before (""off"" condition) and after a subcutaneous injection of apomorphine (""on"" condition). The gating effects of a voluntary movement (clenching of the hand) on the SEPs were also studied for the wearing-off group of PD patients (in states off and on) in comparison with the healthy subjects. At rest and in the off condition the amplitude of the frontal N30 was significantly reduced in the 2 groups of PD patients. We demonstrate that the movement gating ability of the PD patient is preserved in spite of the reduced amplitude of the frontal N30. This result suggests that the specific change in the frontal N30 in PD is not the consequence of a continuous gating of the sensory inflow by a motor corollary discharge. Clinical motor improvement induced by apomorphine was associated with a significant enhancement of the frontal N30 wave. In contrast, the subcortical P14 and N18 waves and the cortical N20, P22, P27 and N45 were not statistically modified by the drug. Apomorphine infusion did not change the absolute reduced voltage of the N30 reached during the movement gating. While the frontal N30 component of the non-parkinsonian patients was significantly lower in comparison to healthy subjects, this wave did not change after the apomorphine administration. In the wearing-off PD patient group the frontal N30 increment was positively correlated with the number of off hours per day. This specific apomorphine sensitivity of the frontal N30 was interpreted as a physiological index of the dopaminergic modulatory control exerted on the neuronal structures implicated in the generation of the frontal N30."

BAER-101, a selective potentiator of α2- and α3-containing GABAA receptors, fully suppresses spontaneous cortical spike-wave discharges in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS).	DOI: 10.1002/ddr.22160	BAER-101 (formerly AZD7325) is a selective partial potentiator of α2/3-containing γ-amino-butyric acid A receptors (GABAARs) and produces minimal sedation and dizziness. Antiseizure effects in models of Dravet and Fragile X Syndromes have been published. BAER-101 has been administered to over 700 healthy human volunteers and patients where it was found to be safe and well tolerated. To test the extent of the antiseizure activity of BAER-1010, we tested BAER-101 in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) model, a widely used and translationally relevant model. GAERS rats with recording electrodes bilaterally located over the frontal and parietal cortices were used. Electroencepholographic (EEG) signals in freely moving awake rats were analyzed for spike-wave discharges (SWDs). BAER-101 was administered orally at doses of 0.3-100 mg/kg and diazepam was used as a positive control using a cross-over protocol with a wash-out period between treatments. The number of SWDs was dose-dependently reduced by BAER-101 with 0.3 mg/kg being the minimally effective dose (MED). The duration of and total time in SWDs were also reduced by BAER-101. Concentrations of drug in plasma achieved an MED of 10.1 nM, exceeding the Ki for α2 or α3, but 23 times lower than the Ki for α5-GABAARs. No adverse events were observed up to a dose 300× MED. The data support the possibility of antiseizure efficacy without the side effects associated with other GABAAR subtypes. This is the first report of an α2/3-selective GABA PAM suppressing seizures in the GAERS model. The data encourage proceeding to test BAER-101 in patients with epilepsy.

Aiming at determining the possible relevance of the neuropeptide Y Y2 receptor for action cascading processes, this study investigates a functional promoter variation (rs2234759) in the neuropeptide Y Y2 receptor gene (NPY2R). 176 healthy subjects completed a stop-change paradigm. Applying mathematical constraints to the obtained behavioral data allowed for a classification of the action cascading processing mode on a serial to parallel continuum. Neurophysiological data (EEG) were analyzed along this mathematical constraint. The behavioral data show that the Y2-receptor high expression G allele is associated with a less efficient mode of action cascading where different task goals are activated in parallel. The neurophysiological data indicate that this effect is based on modulations at the response selection stage but not on changes in the preceding attentional selection processes. Analyses show that the interrelation between behavioral and neurophysiological data is mediated by genotype effects. At the level of response selection, genotype effects are associated with activity changes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Changes in the reliability of neural synchronization processes in the theta frequency band are also related to these effects. Possibly, these Y2-receptor-related effects emerge from the receptor's strong interrelation with the dopamine system.

Sleep-EEG in patients with primary aldosteronism in comparison to healthy controls and patients with depression.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.02.020	The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)/glucocorticoid receptor balance plays an important role in the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression. Aldosterone, a primary MR ligand, seems to be related to the pathophysiology of anxiety and depressive symptoms. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of aldosterone excess on sleep EEG, as sleep EEG is a tool to gain insight into psychoneuroendocrine function. Here, 19 untreated patients (9 males, 10 females) suffering from primary aldosteronism were investigated using sleep EEG and several rating scales for anxiety, depression, quality of life and sleep before starting specific treatment. Parameters were compared to age and sex matched healthy controls and patients with depression and correlated with laboratory findings and blood pressure. Patients had higher values for anxiety and depression compared to the general population, although a psychiatric disorder in their history was ruled out. Although sleep disturbances were reported in the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, sleep EEG did not show significant changes between patients and healthy controls. No depression specific pattern in sleep EEG was found. But in contrast to females, several sleep-EEG parameters of male PA patients differed significantly from patients with depression. There was a significant correlation between blood pressure and the severity of depression and anxiety in females. Correlation analysis between blood pressure and rating scales indicate a relationship between blood pressure and anxiety in women. In conclusion, these data suggest gender related effects of aldosterone excess in males and females.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, HPA-axis and sleep-EEG changes in unmedicated patients with depression after total sleep deprivation.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2006-931476	Changes in the activity of the renin-angiontensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in depression have recently been reported. Renin and aldosterone secretion are coupled to sleep in healthy subjects. As total sleep deprivation (TSD) leads to a rapid mood improvement in patients with depression, it is of interest to investigate its effect on the response of the RAAS in the recovery night in this population as a possible probe for the neurobiological effects of TSD and potentially other rapid acting antidepressive interventions. Additionally we explored the HPA-system and the sleep-EEG-changes.

Aldosterone release during the sleep-wake cycle in humans.	DOI: 10.1152/ajpendo.1999.276.1.E43	The aim of this study was to assess the relative influence on the 24-h aldosterone profile of the adrenocorticotropic system, primarily modulated by a circadian rhythmicity, and the renin-angiotensin system, which is influenced by sleep. Cortisol, plasma renin activity (PRA), and aldosterone were measured for 24 h in healthy subjects under basal conditions, once with nocturnal sleep and once with a night of sleep deprivation followed by 8 h of daytime sleep. The sleep period displayed high mean aldosterone levels, pulse amplitude, and frequency that were reduced during waking periods. During sleep, aldosterone pulses were mainly related to PRA oscillations, whereas they were mainly associated with cortisol pulses during waking periods. Cross-correlation analysis between sleep electroencephalographic activity in the delta band and aldosterone levels yielded significant results, aldosterone following delta waves by approximately 30 min. This study demonstrates that the 24-h aldosterone profile is strongly influenced by sleep processes. A dual influence, by the renin-angiotensin system during sleep and by the adrenocorticotropic system during wakefulness, is exerted on aldosterone pulses throughout the 24-h period.

Effects of calcitonin on human auditory and visual evoked brain potentials.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02244964	Besides its Ca(++)-regulative effects, calcitonin is known to diminish sensitivity to painful stimuli. The present study aimed to clarify whether calcitonin has similar effects on stimulus processing in other modalities. Effects of calcitonin were assessed on brain potentials recorded from the human scalp which were evoked either by auditory clicks or visual checkerboard pattern-reversals. Twelve healthy men were tested in a double-blind intra-subject design receiving either 0.1 IU/kg salmon calcitonin (sCT) or 1.0 IU/kg sCT or saline solution during a 20 min IV infusion. sCT significantly increased latency of wave V of the brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP). Effects of BAEP wave V increased in magnitude with increasing dose of sCT and with decreasing intensity of the click stimulus. There was also a slight increase in latency of the N80 of the pattern-reversal visual evoked potential (PR-VEP). Additionally, subjects rated themselves as less activated following the high dose of sCT compared to placebo. The pattern of results is in accord with a slowing or inhibitory influence of calcitonin on auditory and visual sensory processing, thus paralleling findings concerning calcitonin effects on the perception of painful somatosensory stimuli.

Day-to-day individual alpha frequency variability measured by a mobile EEG device relates to anxiety.	DOI: 10.1111/ejn.16002	The individual alpha frequency (IAF) has previously been identified as a unique neural signature within the 8-12 Hz alpha frequency band. However, the day-to-day variability of this feature is unknown. To investigate this, healthy participants recorded their own brain activity daily at home using the Muse 2 headband, a low-cost consumer-grade mobile electroencephalography (EEG) device. Resting-state recordings of all participants using a high-density (HD) EEG were also collected in lab before and after the at-home data collection period. We found that the IAF extracted from the Muse 2 was comparable to that of location-matched HD-EEG electrodes. No significant difference was found between these IAF values before and after the at-home recording period for the HD-EEG device. Similarly, there was also no statistically significant difference between the beginning and end of the at-home recording period for the Muse 2 headband over 1 month. Despite the group-level stability of IAF, the individual-level day-to-day IAF variability carried mental health-relevant information: Exploratory analyses revealed a relationship between IAF day-to-day variability and trait anxiety. We also noted that the IAF systematically varied across the scalp and although the Muse 2 electrodes do not cover the occipital lobe where alpha oscillations were the strongest, IAFs measured in the temporal lobe and occipital lobe were strongly correlated. Altogether, these results show that mobile EEG devices are useful for studying IAF variability. The relationship between day-to-day variability of region-specific IAF and the dynamics of psychiatric symptoms, particularly anxiety, should be further investigated.

Thalamic post-inhibitory bursting occurs in patients with organic dystonia more often than controls.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2013.10.006	We now test the hypothesis that post-inhibitory bursting in the human pallidal receiving nucleus of the thalamus (ventral oral) mediates inhibitory pallido-thalamic transmission during dystonia. We have compared thalamic single neuron activity in nine patients with organic dystonia to that in a patient with psychogenic dystonia (Psyd) and in healthy waking monkeys. In organic dystonia, EMG power is commonly concentrated at the lowest frequency of the smoothed autopower spectrum (0.39Hz). Therefore, segments of spike trains with a signal-to-noise ratio ≥2 at 0.39Hz were termed dystonia frequency (DF) segments, which occurred more commonly during dystonia related to movement. Those with a SNR<2 were termed non-dystonia frequency (nDF) segments, which were associated with spontaneous dystonia. We concentrated on nDF activity since neuronal activity in our controls was measured at rest. Neuronal spike trains were categorized into those with post-inhibitory bursts (G, grouped), with single spikes (NG, non-grouped), or with both single spikes and bursts (I, intermediate). nDF spike trains in ventral oral had more G category firing in dystonia than in controls. The burst rate and the pre-burst silent period in nDF firing of organic dystonia were consistently greater than those of both the monkeys and the patient with Psyd. The distribution of the pre-burst silent period was bimodal with a longer mode of approximately GABAb (gamma amino butyric acid receptor-type b) duration. These results demonstrate distinct differences of post-inhibitory bursting in organic dystonia versus controls. The presence of inhibitory events consistent with GABAb duration suggests interventions for treatment of dystonia.

Event related oscillations in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2008.07.081	Bipolar disorder involves dysfunction in gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)/glutamatergic systems and neural circuits that regulate cognitive processing. Valproate, a mood stabilizing anticonvulsant, modulates GABA/glutamate and shows neuroprotective effect. Electroencephalographic oscillatory activity assessment is an alternative brain imaging technique with high time resolution. It presents integrative brain functioning. We aimed to assess the oscillatory responses of patients with bipolar disorder in euthymic state of bipolar disorder and the changes after treatment with valproate. Event related potentials to visual odd-ball paradigm in 10 euthymic medication free, bipolar patients were measured before and after 6 weeks of valproate monotherapy and compared with sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Delta frequency bands, as representative of signal detection and decision-making, were obtained by digital filtering. At baseline, patients showed higher delta responses to target stimuli in all but significantly left frontal channels in comparison to controls. After 6 weeks of treatment, delta responses decreased significantly in central frontal (Fz) (p: 0.028), left frontal (F3) (p: 0.028), left (T3) (p: 0.015), right anterior (T4) (p: 0.011), and left posterior temporal (T5) (p: 0.011) channels compared to baseline and became no different to the controls, which did not differ between two assessments. The findings point to a diffuse increase in low frequency electrical activity which was prominent in the left frontal location in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. Reduction of the electrical activity of the left frontal and bilateral anterior temporal areas with treatment may be through modulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic mechanisms and indicative of valproate's neuroprotective effect.

Marked increases of plasma gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations in cirrhotic patients with portacaval shunts are not associated with alterations of cerebral functions.	DOI: 10.1159/000200724	Several previous studies have shown that the plasma concentration of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) is markedly increased in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, and it has been suggested that decreased metabolism of peripheral GABA might contribute to the cerebral dysfunctions observed. In the present study, plasma GABA-like activity was determined by a radioreceptor assay in 21 cirrhotic patients in whom, at least 2 months prior to the study, portocaval shunt surgery had been performed for treatment of recurrent variceal bleeding. Compared to 10 healthy volunteers, plasma GABA concentrations were increased in all cirrhotic patients, whereas most other amino acids, including those known to interfere with the GABA radioreceptor assay at elevated concentrations, were within the normal range. Despite an about 3- to 16-fold increase in individual GABA concentration, none of the patients showed clinical signs of overt hepatic encephalopathy on conventional neurologic (including EEG) and mental status examination. Furthermore, when a psychometric test system was used for evaluation of intellectual and psychomotor functions, all patients performed within the normal range and could not be distinguished from healthy volunteers. The data indicate that, at least in chronic liver disease, impaired metabolism of peripheral GABA does not lead to cerebral dysfunctions.

Altered S100 Calcium-Binding Protein B and Matrix Metallopeptidase 9 as Biomarkers of Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy with Hippocampus Sclerosis.	DOI: 10.1007/s12031-018-1164-5	Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is the most common form of partial epilepsy. The aim of the present study is to highlight possible and suitable biomarkers that can help in the diagnosis and prognosis of this intractable form of epilepsy. The study was carried out on 30 epileptic patients of both sexes with complex partial seizures, having an age ranging from 4 to 30 years and were selected from the outpatient epilepsy clinic at the Kasr El-Aini Hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Thirty healthy children and young adults, age- and sex-matched to the patients, were included in the study as controls. Patients with epilepsy and healthy controls were subjected to a set of laboratory analyses including S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), C-reactive protein (CRP), and prolactin (PRL), in addition to neurophysiological, radiological, and psychometric assessments, on the basis of the recent evidence of the field. The results of this study showed a marked increase in the investigated biomarkers in patients with epilepsy compared to controls. The performance of the epileptic patients in psychometric assessments was below the average threshold, with the MRI analysis showing specific findings of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and EEG showing anterior temporal spikes. A significant negative correlation was found between MMP9 and psychometric test. On the other hand, a significant positive correlation was observed between seizure severity and the indicated biomarker. The present study suggests that S100B and MMP9 could be used as biomarkers for neuronal injury and helps in the prognosis of MTLE.

High Mobility Group Protein B1 (HMGB1) and Interleukin-1β as Prognostic Biomarkers of Epilepsy in Children.	DOI: 10.1177/0883073818801654	The present study examined whether serum biomarkers can predict the prognosis of childhood epilepsy, including seizure frequency, electroencephalographic (EEG) changes, and cognitive impairment. We measured serum concentrations of high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), S100 calcium-binding protein B (S-100B), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and α1-antichymotrypsin (AACT) in 180 children with new-onset epilepsy and 40 healthy children. Cognitive evaluations were performed 18 months after the initial seizure episodes at diagnosis (ie, baseline visit). The relationship between serum biomarkers and epilepsy prognosis was investigated using Pearson correlation coefficients, logistic regression analyses, and receiver operating characteristic curves. Sixty-seven patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 92 had focal motor seizures, and 21 had epileptic spasms. Serum concentrations of HMGB1, IL-1β, S-100B, and GFAP were significantly higher in the epilepsy group within 24 hours of a seizure episode than in the control group. Furthermore, HMGB1 and IL-1β were significant predictors of epilepsy prognosis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that HMGB1 could more accurately predict seizure frequency than IL-1β; when the serum concentration of HMGB1 was >9.625 ng/mL, there was 80.6% sensitivity and 92.5% specificity for predicting seizure frequency reduction. In conclusion, HMGB1 and IL-1β have a predictive value for epilepsy prognosis in children.

PER3 polymorphism predicts cumulative sleep homeostatic but not neurobehavioral changes to chronic partial sleep deprivation.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0005874	The variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism 5-repeat allele of the circadian gene PERIOD3 (PER3(5/5)) has been associated with cognitive decline at a specific circadian phase in response to a night of total sleep deprivation (TSD), relative to the 4-repeat allele (PER3(4/4)). PER3(5/5) has also been related to higher sleep homeostasis, which is thought to underlie this cognitive vulnerability. To date, no study has used a candidate gene approach to investigate the response to chronic partial sleep deprivation (PSD), a condition distinct from TSD and one commonly experienced by millions of people on a daily and persistent basis. We evaluated whether the PER3 VNTR polymorphism contributed to cumulative neurobehavioral deficits and sleep homeostatic responses during PSD.

Frontal and rostral anterior cingulate (rACC) theta EEG in depression: implications for treatment outcome?	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.03.007	In major depressive disorder (MDD), elevated theta current density in the rostral anterior cingulate (rACC), as estimated by source localization of scalp-recorded electroencenphalogram (EEG), has been associated with response to antidepressant treatments, whereas elevated frontal theta has been linked to non-response. This study used source localization to attempt to integrate these apparently opposite results and test, whether antidepressant response is associated with elevated rACC theta and non-response with elevated frontal theta and whether theta activity is a differential predictor of response to different types of commonly used antidepressants. In the international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D), a multi-center, international, randomized, prospective practical trial, 1008 MDD participants were randomized to escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine-XR. The study also recruited 336 healthy controls. Treatment response and remission were established after eight weeks using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17). The resting-state EEG was assessed at baseline with eyes closed and source localization (eLORETA) was employed to extract theta from the rACC and frontal cortex. Patients with MDD had elevated theta in both frontal cortex and rACC, with small effect sizes. High frontal and rACC theta were associated with treatment non-response, but not with non-remission, and this effect was most pronounced in a subgroup with previous treatment failures. Low theta in frontal cortex and rACC are found in responders to antidepressant treatments with a small effect size.

EEG Abnormalities Are Associated With Poorer Depressive Symptom Outcomes With Escitalopram and Venlafaxine-XR, but Not Sertraline: Results From the Multicenter Randomized iSPOT-D Study.	DOI: 10.1177/1550059415621435	"Rationale Limited research is available on electrophysiological abnormalities such as epileptiform EEG or EEG slowing in depression and its association with antidepressant treatment response. Objectives We investigated the association between EEG abnormalities and antidepressant treatment response in the international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D). Methods Of 1008 participants with major depressive disorder randomized to escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine-XR, 622 completed 8 weeks of treatment per protocol. The study also recruited 336 healthy controls. Treatment response was established after 8 weeks using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17). The resting-state EEG was assessed at baseline with eyes closed. EEG abnormalities including epileptiform activity, EEG slowing, and alpha peak frequency (APF) were scored for all subjects, blind to treatment outcome. Results Patients and controls did not differ in the occurrence of EEG abnormalities. Furthermore, in the per protocol sample the occurrence of epileptiform EEG and EEG slowing (as a combined marker) were associated with a reduced likelihood of responding to escitalopram (P = .019; odds ratio [OR] = 3.56) and venlafaxine-XR (P = .043; OR = 2.76), but not sertraline (OR = 0.73). The response rates for this ""any EEG abnormality"" groups versus the ""no-abnormality"" group were 33% and 64% for escitalopram and 41% and 66% for venlafaxine-XR, respectively. A slow APF was associated with treatment response only in the sertraline group (P = .21; d = .027). Conclusions EEG abnormalities are associated with nonresponse to escitalopram and venlafaxine-XR, but not sertraline, whereas a slow APF is associated to response for sertraline only."

Heartbeat-Evoked Potential in Major Depressive Disorder: A Biomarker for Differential Treatment Prediction between Venlafaxine and rTMS?	DOI: 10.1159/000529308	Currently, major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment plans are based on trial-and-error, and remission rates remain low. A strategy to replace trial-and-error and increase remission rates could be treatment stratification. We explored the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) as a biomarker for treatment stratification to either antidepressant medication or rTMS treatment.

Utility of event-related potentials in predicting antidepressant treatment response: An iSPOT-D report.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.07.022	It is essential to improve antidepressant treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and one way this could be achieved is by reducing the number of treatment steps by employing biomarkers that can predict treatment outcome. This study investigated differences between MDD patients and healthy controls in the P3 and N1 component from the event-related potential (ERP) generated in a standard two-tone oddball paradigm. Furthermore, the P3 and N1 are investigated as predictors for treatment outcome to three different antidepressants. In the international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D)--a multi-center, international, randomized, prospective practical trial--1008 MDD participants were randomized to escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine-XR. The study also recruited 336 healthy controls. Treatment response and remission were established after eight weeks using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. P3 and N1 latencies and amplitudes were analyzed using a peak-picking approach and further replicated by using exact low resolution tomography (eLORETA). A reduced P3 was found in MDD patients compared to controls by a peak-picking analysis. This was validated in a temporal global field power analysis. Source density analysis revealed that the difference in cortical activity originated from the posterior cingulate and parahippocampal gyrus. Male non-responders to venlafaxine-XR had significantly smaller N1 amplitudes than responders. This was demonstrated by both analytical methods. Male non-responders to venlafaxine-XR had less activity originating from the left insular cortex. The observed results are discussed from a neural network viewpoint.

P300 in obsessive-compulsive disorder: source localization and the effects of treatment.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2013.09.003	Converging evidence suggests that frontostriatal abnormalities underlie OCD symptoms. The event-related potential P300 is generated along a widely distributed network involving several of the areas implicated in OCD. P300 abnormalities reported in patients with OCD suggest increased activity in these areas. The aim of the present study was to investigate this assumption in unmedicated patients with OCD, and to assess the effects of OCD treatment on P300 brain activity patterns. Seventy-one unmedicated patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD and 71 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects participated in the study. The P300 was obtained through 32-channel EEG during an auditory oddball paradigm. Forty-three patients underwent a second EEG assessment after treatment with sertraline and behavioural therapy. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to localize the sources of brain electrical activity.

Influence of phosphatidylserine on cognitive performance and cortical activity after induced stress.	DOI: 10.1179/147683008X301478	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of phosphatidylserine (PS) on cognition and cortical activity after mental stress. After familiarization, 16 healthy subjects completed cognitive tasks after induced stress in a test-re-test design (T1 and T2). Directly after T1, subjects were assigned double-blind to either PS or placebo groups followed by T2 after 42 days. At T1 and T2, cortical activity was measured at baseline and immediately after stress with cognitive tasks using electro-encephalography (EEG). EEG was recorded at 17 electrode positions and fast Fourier transforms (FFT) determined power at Theta, Alpha-1, Alpha-2, Beta-1 and Beta-2. Statistics were calculated using ANOVA (group x trial x time). The main finding of the study was that chronic supplementation of phosphatidylserine significantly decreases Beta-1 power in right hemispheric frontal brain regions (F8; P < 0.05) before and after induced stress. The results for Beta-1 power in the PS group were connected to a more relaxed state compared to the controls.

Double-blind cross-over study of phosphatidylserine vs. placebo in patients with early dementia of the Alzheimer type.	DOI: 10.1016/0924-977x(92)90025-4	Thirty-three patients with mild primary degenerative dementia according to DSM-III (MMS between 15 and 27) took part in a double-blind cross-over study of phosphatidylserine (Fidia, 300 mg/d) versus placebo. Both treatment phases lasted for 8 weeks with an 8 week washout phase in between and a 4 week washout phase before treatment phase one. Clinical global improvement ratings showed significantly more patients improving under BC-PS than under placebo during treatment phase one. The improvement carried over to the following wash-out and treatment phases. There were no significant improvements in GBS dementia rating scale, psychometric tests or P300-latency. 16-channel EEG mapping findings indicated that the patients initially showed higher power values in all frequency bands (except alpha), when compared to a younger, healthy control group. BC-PS reduced the higher power values compared to placebo, shifting EEG power more towards the normal level.

Phosphatidylserine: quantitative EEG effects in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1159/000119041	Eight healthy paid male volunteers (age: 21-28 years, mean: 24.5 +/- 1.7 years; weight 62-79 kg) were administered via intravenous infusion (3 min) acute 25-, 50-, and 75-mg doses of phosphatidylserine, or matching placebo in a latin-square design. Multichannel EEG recordings were performed in baseline conditions, during intravenous infusion, and 10, 30, 90, 180, and 360 min after drug/placebo administration. Blood pressure, heart rate, critical flicker-fusion frequency, and the subjects' performance at immediate and short-term retention tests were assessed after each electroencephalographic (EEG) recording. The EEG signal was quantified off-line by power spectral analysis, and bidimensional scalp maps were produced for each EEG variable. Descriptive statistical comparisons among subjects and between pre- and postdrug EEG recordings allowed the detection of systematic EEG changes (notably increment of the power on the 'alpha' frequency, which was restricted to the anterior electrode deviations at the 50-mg dose and the widespread to the whole scalp at the highest dose, and increase of the signal total power) in the absence of significant modifications of the subjects' neuropsychological status.

Pre-Stimulus Power but Not Phase Predicts Prefrontal Cortical Excitability in TMS-EEG.	DOI: 10.3390/bios13020220	The cortical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has notable inter-trial variability. One source of this variability can be the influence of the phase and power of pre-stimulus neuronal oscillations on single-trial TMS responses. Here, we investigate the effect of brain oscillatory activity on TMS response in 49 distinct healthy participants (64 datasets) who had received single-pulse TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Across all frequency bands of theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (14-30 Hz), there was no significant effect of pre-TMS phase on single-trial cortical evoked activity. After high-powered oscillations, whether followed by a TMS pulse or not, the subsequent activity was larger than after low-powered oscillations. We further defined a measure, corrected_effect, to enable us to investigate brain responses to the TMS pulse disentangled from the power of ongoing (spontaneous) oscillations. The corrected_effect was significantly different from zero (meaningful added effect of TMS) only in theta and beta bands. Our results suggest that brain state prior to stimulation might play some role in shaping the subsequent TMS-EEG response. Specifically, our findings indicate that the power of ongoing oscillatory activity, but not phase, can influence brain responses to TMS. Aligning the TMS pulse with specific power thresholds of an EEG signal might therefore reduce variability in neurophysiological measurements and also has the potential to facilitate more robust therapeutic effects of stimulation.

Impact of Music in Males and Females for Relief from Neurodegenerative Disorder Stress.	DOI: 10.1155/2022/3080437	Neurological imbalance sometimes resulted in stress, which is experienced by the number of people at some moment in their life. A considerable measurement scheme can quantify the stress level in an individual, in which music has always been considered as the best therapy for stress relief in healthy human being as well in severe medical conditions. In this work, the impact of four types of music interventions with the lyrics of Hindi music and varying spectral centroid has been studied for an analysis of stress relief in males and females. The self-reported data for stress using state-trait anxiety (STA) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals for 14 channels in response to music interventions have been considered. Features such as Hjorth (activity, mobility, and complexity), variance, standard deviation, skew, kurtosis, and mean have been extracted from five bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) of each channel of the recorded EEG signals from 9 males and 9 females of the age category between 18 and 25 years. The support vector machine classifier has been used to classify three subsets: (i) male and female, (ii) baseline and female, and (iii) baseline and male. The noteworthy accuracy of 100% was found at the delta band for the first subset, beta and gamma bands for the second subset, and beta, gamma, and delta bands for the third subset. STA score has shown more deviation in the male category than in female, which gives a clear insight into the impact of music intervention with varying spectral centroid that has a higher impact to relieve stress in the male category than the female category.

Psychomotor and cognitive effects of a single oral dose of talnetant (SB223412) in healthy volunteers compared with placebo or haloperidol.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881108094524	Central Nervous System (CNS) effects of talnetant, an NK-3 antagonist in development for schizophrenia, were compared to those of haloperidol and placebo. The study was randomised, double-blind, three-way crossover of talnetant 200 mg, haloperidol 3 mg or placebo. Twelve healthy males participated and EEG, saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements, adaptive tracking, body sway, finger tapping, hormones, visual analogue scales (VAS) for alertness, mood and calmness and psychedelic effects, left/right distraction task, Tower of London and Visual and Verbal Learning Task were assessed. Haloperidol showed (difference to placebo; 95% CI; p-value) decreases in EEG alpha power (-0.87microV; -1.51/-0.22; p = 0.0110), saccadic inaccuracy (2.0%; 0.5/3.6; p = 0.0133), smooth pursuit eye movements (-7.5%; -12.0/-3.0; p = 0.0026), adaptive tracking (-3.5%; -5.4/-1.7; p = 0.0009), alertness (-6.8 mm; -11.1/-2.4; p = 0.0039), negative mood (-4.6 mm; -8.6/-0.6; p = 0.0266), the ability to control thoughts (1.2 mm; 0.2/2.3; p = 0.0214), and an increase of serum prolactin (ratio 4.1; 3.0/5.6; p < 0.0001). Talnetant showed decreased alpha power (-0.69 muV; -1.34/-0.04; p = 0.0390), improved adaptive tracking (1.9%; 0.1/3.7; p = 0.0370) and reduced calmness on VAS Bond and Lader (-4.5 mm; -8.0/-1.0; p = 0.0151). Haloperidol effects were predominantly CNS-depressant, while those of talnetant were slightly stimulatory.

Theanine maintains sleep quality in healthy young women by suppressing the increase in caffeine-induced wakefulness after sleep onset.	DOI: 10.1039/d3fo01247f	Energy drinks take advantage of caffeine's effects on wakefulness and performance; however, excessive intake has a negative effect on sleep. Green tea is consumed worldwide and has both a stimulating effect from caffeine and a calming or relaxing effect from theanine. Theanine reduces the excitotoxicity of caffeine. This study evaluated whether theanine improves the sleep quality worsened by caffeine in healthy young women. Sleep latency, sleep time, wake after sleep onset (WASO) time, and the number of WASOs were measured. A crossover study was performed using four treatment groups: theanine (50 mg), caffeine (30 mg), combined theanine and caffeine (TC), and placebo. The sleep stage was determined using electroencephalograms, and cerebral blood flow was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. The caffeine group showed a significant increase in the WASO time compared with the placebo group; no difference was observed between the theanine or TC group and the placebo group. There were no differences in the sleep-onset latency or number of WASOs between the theanine, caffeine, or TC groups and the placebo group. In combination with theanine, only the caffeine-induced increase in the WASO time was suppressed. Our results suggest that theanine can reduce caffeine's effects on sleep quality.

Anti-Stress, Behavioural and Magnetoencephalography Effects of an L-Theanine-Based Nutrient Drink: A Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Trial.	DOI: 10.3390/nu8010053	L-theanine (γ-glutamylethylamide) is an amino acid found primarily in the green tea plant. This study explored the effects of an L-theanine-based nutrient drink on mood responses to a cognitive stressor. Additional measures included an assessment of cognitive performance and resting state alpha oscillatory activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Thirty-four healthy adults aged 18-40 participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced crossover study. The primary outcome measure, subjective stress response to a multitasking cognitive stressor, was significantly reduced one hour after administration of the L-theanine drink when compared to placebo. The salivary cortisol response to the stressor was reduced three hours post-dose following active treatment. No treatment-related cognitive performance changes were observed. Resting state alpha oscillatory activity was significantly greater in posterior MEG sensors after active treatment compared to placebo two hours post-dose; however, this effect was only apparent for those higher in trait anxiety. This change in resting state alpha oscillatory activity was not correlated with the change in subjective stress response or the cortisol response, suggesting further research is required to assess the functional relevance of these treatment-related changes in resting alpha activity. These findings further support the anti-stress effects of L-theanine.

L-theanine, a natural constituent in tea, and its effect on mental state.		Tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world after water. Tea is known to be a rich source of flavonoid antioxidants. However tea also contains a unique amino acid, L-theanine that may modulate aspects of brain function in humans. Evidence from human electroencephalograph (EEG) studies show that it has a direct effect on the brain (Juneja et al. Trends in Food Science & Tech 1999;10;199-204). L-theanine significantly increases activity in the alpha frequency band which indicates that it relaxes the mind without inducing drowsiness. However, this effect has only been established at higher doses than that typically found in a cup of black tea (approximately 20mg). The aim of the current research was to establish this effect at more realistic dietary levels. EEG was measured in healthy, young participants at baseline and 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 minutes after ingestion of 50mg L-theanine (n=16) or placebo (n=19). Participants were resting with their eyes closed during EEG recording. There was a greater increase in alpha activity across time in the L-theanine condition (relative to placebo (p+0.05). A second study replicated this effect in participants engaged in passive activity. These data indicate that L-theanine, at realistic dietary levels, has a significant effect on the general state of mental alertness or arousal. Furthermore, alpha activity is known to play an important role in critical aspects of attention, and further research is therefore focussed on understanding the effect of L-theanine on attentional processes.

Source density analysis of the human EEG after ingestion of a drink containing decaffeinated extract of green tea enriched with L-theanine and theogallin.	DOI: 10.1080/03093640701580610	Source density analysis of EEG recordings from 12 healthy human volunteers was used in a randomized, placebo controlled cross over study to investigate the change in physiological parameters after ingestion of a soft drink containing green tea extract enriched with L-theanine and theogallin. EEG was recorded 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after ingestion during different recording conditions. Visually evoked P300 potentials were recorded every hour in addition to the EEG recordings. Analysis of the data revealed a general attenuation of electrical delta power under the condition of eyes open during the first hour (statistically significant at p < 0.01). During a reading test increases of delta and theta power were observed at frontal electrode sites starting with the second hour after administration, significant at the third and fourth hour (p < 0.04) in comparison to placebo. These changes indicate a higher level of mental performance. Increases of beta 1 power starting with the second hour indicated a higher degree of relaxation. However, no statistical significance was reached. Analysis of visually evoked P300 waves revealed a decrease in latency at the last hour (statistical significance p < 0.04) as well as increases of amplitudes at the electrode position Cz (from the first to the third hour, statistically not significant). This type of result in general suggests an improvement of attention. Thus, decaffeinated extract of green tea still has a stimulating effect despite the lack of caffeine presumably due to its high content in L-theanine and theogallin as found in preclinical experiments.

Effects of sweet and bitter gustatory stimuli in anorexia nervosa on EEG frequency spectra.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2003.11.001	The possible differences in processing gustatory stimuli in anorexic patients compared to healthy control subjects was investigated by electrophysiological methods. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in outpatients treated with anorexia nervosa (AN) and age-matched controls after exposure to sweet (milk chocolate) and bitter (black tea) taste stimuli. Power spectrum analysis was performed on EEG epochs recorded in the above conditions. Compared to controls a significantly higher percent of theta, and lower percent of alpha1 band power was found in anorexic patients, irrespective of the kind of taste effects and hemispheric side. The pattern of activation caused by sweet and bitter stimuli was found to be different in these two groups, possibly indicating altered gustatory processing mechanisms in AN.

Nonlinear and linear EEG complexity changes caused by gustatory stimuli in anorexia nervosa.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2003.10.003	The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of pleasant and unpleasant gustatory stimuli on nonlinear and linear complexity measures of the EEG in healthy controls and in anorexia nervosa (AN) patients. The subjects were exposed to unpleasant (bitter tea) and pleasant (chocolate) gustatory stimuli for 2 min. Multichannel EEG was recorded and the dimensional complexity (point-correlation dimension) and Omega complexity were calculated from the EEG epochs corresponding to the above taste conditions. In AN patients lower-dimensional complexity was observed in the majority of recording sites than that seen in controls, independent of taste conditions. Higher Omega complexity was seen in control subjects in the left side irrespective of taste effects. No such hemispheric difference was observed in AN. The lower-dimensional complexity seen in AN patients may be caused by long-lasting effects of malnutrition. The lack of a significant Omega complexity change in response to exposure of sweet taste in the left side seen in AN patients may correspond to a decreased sensitivity to such stimuli in these subjects.

Topographic pharmaco-EEG mapping of the effects of the South American psychoactive beverage ayahuasca in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-2125.2002.01609.x	Ayahuasca is a traditional South American psychoactive beverage used in Amazonian shamanism, and in the religious ceremonies of Brazilian-based syncretic religious groups with followers in the US and several European countries. This tea contains measurable amounts of the psychotropic indole N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and beta-carboline alkaloids with MAO-inhibiting properties. In a previous report we described a profile of stimulant and psychedelic effects for ayahuasca as measured by subjective report self-assessment instruments.

Chewing-gum flavor affects measures of global complexity of multichannel EEG.	DOI: 10.1159/000119329	Global complexity of spontaneous brain electric activity was studied before and after chewing gum without flavor and with 2 different flavors. One-minute, 19-channel, eyes-closed electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded from 20 healthy males before and after using 3 types of chewing gum: regular gum containing sugar and aromatic additives, gum containing 200 mg theanine (a constituent of Japanese green tea), and gum base (no sugar, no aromatic additives); each was chewed for 5 min in randomized sequence. Brain electric activity was assessed through Global Omega (Omega)-Complexity and Global Dimensional Complexity (GDC), quantitative measures of complexity of the trajectory of EEG map series in state space; their differences from pre-chewing data were compared across gum-chewing conditions. Friedman Anova (p < 0.043) showed that effects on Omega-Complexity differed significantly between conditions and differences were maximal between gum base and theanine gum. No differences were found using GDC. Global Omega-Complexity appears to be a sensitive measure for subtle, central effects of chewing gum with and without flavor.

Treatment in early psychosis with N-acetyl-cysteine for 6months improves low-level auditory processing: Pilot study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.schres.2017.07.008	Sensory impairments constitute core dysfunctions in schizophrenia. In the auditory modality, impaired mismatch negativity (MMN) has been observed in chronic schizophrenia and may reflect N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) hypo-function, consistent with models of schizophrenia based on oxidative stress. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated deficits in the N100 component of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) in early psychosis patients. Previous work has shown that add-on administration of the glutathione precursor N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) improves the MMN and clinical symptoms in chronic schizophrenia. To date, it remains unknown whether NAC also improves general low-level auditory processing and if its efficacy would extend to early-phase psychosis. We addressed these issues with a randomized, double-blind study of a small sample (N=15) of early psychosis (EP) patients and 18 healthy controls from whom AEPs were recorded during an active, auditory oddball task. Patients were recorded twice: once prior to NAC/placebo administration and once after six months of treatment. The N100 component was significantly smaller in patients before NAC administration versus controls. Critically, NAC administration improved this AEP deficit. Source estimations revealed increased activity in the left temporo-parietal lobe in patients after NAC administration. Overall, the data from this pilot study, which call for replication in a larger sample, indicate that NAC improves low-level auditory processing in early psychosis.

Glutamatergic modulation of auditory information processing in the human brain.

In rodents, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a stimulator of the cystine-glutamate exchanger, attenuates the cognitive and behavioral effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. On the basis of these findings, we tested whether NAC would reduce ketamine effects on behavior, MMN, and P300 in healthy humans.

Glutathione precursor, N-acetyl-cysteine, improves mismatch negativity in schizophrenia patients.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1301624	In schizophrenia patients, glutathione dysregulation at the gene, protein and functional levels, leads to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction. These patients also exhibit deficits in auditory sensory processing that manifests as impaired mismatch negativity (MMN), which is an auditory evoked potential (AEP) component related to NMDA receptor function. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor, was administered to patients to determine whether increased levels of brain glutathione would improve MMN and by extension NMDA function. A randomized, double-blind, cross-over protocol was conducted, entailing the administration of NAC (2 g/day) for 60 days and then placebo for another 60 days (or vice versa). 128-channel AEPs were recorded during a frequency oddball discrimination task at protocol onset, at the point of cross-over, and at the end of the study. At the onset of the protocol, the MMN of patients was significantly impaired compared to sex- and age- matched healthy controls (p=0.003), without any evidence of concomitant P300 component deficits. Treatment with NAC significantly improved MMN generation compared with placebo (p=0.025) without any measurable effects on the P300 component. MMN improvement was observed in the absence of robust changes in assessments of clinical severity, though the latter was observed in a larger and more prolonged clinical study. This pattern suggests that MMN enhancement may precede changes to indices of clinical severity, highlighting the possible utility AEPs as a biomarker of treatment efficacy. The improvement of this functional marker may indicate an important pathway towards new therapeutic strategies that target glutathione dysregulation in schizophrenia.

Detection of attempted movement from the EEG during neuromuscular block: proof of principle study in awake volunteers.	DOI: 10.1038/srep12815	Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to detect intraoperative awareness during general anaesthesia. Traditionally, BCI research is aimed at establishing or improving communication and control for patients with permanent paralysis. Patients experiencing intraoperative awareness also lack the means to communicate after administration of a neuromuscular blocker, but may attempt to move. This study evaluates the principle of detecting attempted movements from the electroencephalogram (EEG) during local temporary neuromuscular blockade. EEG was obtained from four healthy volunteers making 3-second hand movements, both before and after local administration of rocuronium in one isolated forearm. Using offline classification analysis we investigated whether the attempted movements the participants made during paralysis could be distinguished from the periods when they did not move or attempt to move. Attempted movement trials were correctly identified in 81 (68-94)% (mean (95% CI)) and 84 (74-93)% of the cases using 30 and 9 EEG channels, respectively. Similar accuracies were obtained when training the classifier on the participants' actual movements. These results provide proof of the principle that a BCI can detect movement attempts during neuromuscular blockade. Based on this, in the future a BCI may serve as a communication channel between a patient under general anaesthesia and the anaesthesiologist.

Exploring the possible relationship between skin microbiome and brain cognitive functions: a pilot EEG study.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-024-57649-z	Human microbiota mainly resides on the skin and in the gut. Human gut microbiota can produce a variety of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that affect many physiological functions and most importantly modulate brain functions through the bidirectional gut-brain axis. Similarly, skin microorganisms also have identical metabolites of SCFAs reported to be involved in maintaining skin homeostasis. However, it remains unclear whether these SCFAs produced by skin bacteria can affect brain cognitive functions. In this study, we hypothesize that the brain's functional activities are associated with the skin bacterial population and examine the influence of local skin-bacterial growth on event-related potentials (ERPs) during an oddball task using EEG. Additionally, five machine learning (ML) methods were employed to discern the relationship between skin microbiota and cognitive functions. Twenty healthy subjects underwent three rounds of tests under different conditions-alcohol, glycerol, and water. Statistical tests confirmed a significant increase in bacterial population under water and glycerol conditions when compared to the alcohol condition. The metabolites of bacteria can turn phenol red from red-orange to yellow, confirming an increase in acidity. P3 amplitudes were significantly enhanced in response to only oddball stimulus at four channels (Fz, FCz, and Cz) and were observed after the removal of bacteria when compared with that under the water and glycerol manipulations. By using machine learning methods, we demonstrated that EEG features could be separated with a good accuracy (> 88%) after experimental manipulations. Our results suggest a relationship between skin microbiota and brain functions. We hope our findings motivate further study into the underlying mechanism. Ultimately, an understanding of the relationship between skin microbiota and brain functions can contribute to the treatment and intervention of diseases that link with this pathway.

EEG spectral slope: A reliable indicator for continuous evaluation of consciousness levels during propofol anesthesia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120426	The level of consciousness undergoes continuous alterations during anesthesia. Prior to the onset of propofol-induced complete unconsciousness, degraded levels of behavioral responsiveness can be observed. However, a reliable index to monitor altered consciousness levels during anesthesia has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we obtained 60-channel EEG data from 24 healthy participants during an ultra-slow propofol infusion protocol starting with an initial concentration of 1 μg/ml and a stepwise increase of 0.2 μg/ml in concentration. Consecutive auditory stimuli were delivered every 5 to 6 s, and the response time to the stimuli was used to assess the responsiveness levels. We calculated the spectral slope in a time-resolved manner by extracting 5-second EEG segments at each auditory stimulus and estimated their correlation with the corresponding response time. Our results demonstrated that during slow propofol infusion, the response time to external stimuli increased, while the EEG spectral slope, fitted at 15-45 Hz, became steeper, and a significant negative correlation was observed between them. Moreover, the spectral slope further steepened at deeper anesthetic levels and became flatter during anesthesia recovery. We verified these findings using an external dataset. Additionally, we found that the spectral slope of frontal electrodes over the prefrontal lobe had the best performance in predicting the response time. Overall, this study used a time-resolved analysis to suggest that the EEG spectral slope could reliably track continuously altered consciousness levels during propofol anesthesia. Furthermore, the frontal spectral slope may be a promising index for clinical monitoring of anesthesia depth.

Microsynt: Exploring the syntax of EEG microstates.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120196	"Microstates represent electroencephalographic (EEG) activity as a sequence of switching, transient, metastable states. Growing evidence suggests the useful information on brain states is to be found in the higher-order temporal structure of these sequences. Instead of focusing on transition probabilities, here we propose ""Microsynt"", a method designed to highlight higher-order interactions that form a preliminary step towards understanding the syntax of microstate sequences of any length and complexity. Microsynt extracts an optimal vocabulary of ""words"" based on the length and complexity of the full sequence of microstates. Words are then sorted into classes of entropy and their representativeness within each class is statistically compared with surrogate and theoretical vocabularies. We applied the method on EEG data previously collected from healthy subjects undergoing propofol anesthesia, and compared their ""fully awake"" (BASE) and ""fully unconscious"" (DEEP) conditions. Results show that microstate sequences, even at rest, are not random but tend to behave in a more predictable way, favoring simpler sub-sequences, or ""words"". Contrary to high-entropy words, lowest-entropy binary microstate loops are prominent and favored on average 10 times more than what is theoretically expected. Progressing from BASE to DEEP, the representation of low-entropy words increases while that of high-entropy words decreases. During the awake state, sequences of microstates tend to be attracted towards ""A - B - C"" microstate hubs, and most prominently A - B binary loops. Conversely, with full unconsciousness, sequences of microstates are attracted towards ""C - D - E"" hubs, and most prominently C - E binary loops, confirming the putative relation of microstates A and B to externally-oriented cognitive processes and microstate C and E to internally-generated mental activity. Microsynt can form a syntactic signature of microstate sequences that can be used to reliably differentiate two or more conditions."

Brain connectivity changes of propofol-induced altered states of consciousness using High-Density EEG Source Estimation.	DOI: 10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871256	Through source estimation, high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) signals at scalp level can be converted into signals at cerebral cortex level, which helps to measure cortical activity during anesthesia induced changes in consciousness level to explore the mechanism. In this research, the high-density EEG of propofol-induced consciousness states alterations in 20 healthy adults were converted into cortical signals of 68 regions of interest (ROI), after alpha bandpass filtering, the pairwise orthogonal power envelope connectivity (PEC) was calculated. Then, due to the number of PECs was huge, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to select as few PECs as possible as the indicators to distinguish baseline (BS) and moderate sedation (MD) states. The results show that most PECs that can be used as indicators are related to ROI related to default mode network (DMN). At the same time, changes of thalamocortical connectivity and frontal-parietal connectivity could be observed, similar to the neuroimaging method of directly measuring cerebral cortical activity. By extracting the PEC as a classifier to classify the BS and MD States, the accuracy could reach more than 70%. Therefore, this method can not only reflect the mechanism of cortical activity alterations induced by anesthetics, but also provide a new idea for monitoring the depth of anesthesia in the future. Clinical Relevance - This shows that the high-density EEG of scalp level can be converted into cortical signals by source estimation, which is similar to the neuroimaging method of directly measuring cortical activity.

The ke0 of propofol was estimated using an effect-compartment model linking pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, in which response variables were electroencephalographic approximate entropy (ApEn) or bispectral index (BIS) (n = 32 each for propofol infusion rates of 6 and 12 mg·kg-1·h-1). Epoch lengths of ApEn were 2, 10, 30, and 60 seconds (s). The correlations between plasma propofol concentrations (Cp) and BIS and ApEn 2, 10, 30, and 60 s were determined, as was the Ce associated with 50% probability of unconsciousness (Ce50,LOC). The pharmacokinetics of propofol were well described by a three-compartment model. The correlation coefficient between Cp and ApEn 2, 10, 30, and 60 s were -0.64, -0.54, -0.39, and -0.26, respectively, whereas correlation coefficient between Cp and BIS was -0.74. The blood-brain equilibration half-life based on the ke0 estimates for ApEn at 2, 10, 30, 60 s and BIS were 4.31, 3.96, 5.78. 6.54, 5.09 min, respectively, whereas the Ce50,LOC for ApEn at 2, 10, 30, 60 s and BIS were 1.55, 1.47, 1.28, 1.04, and 1.55 μg·ml-1, respectively. Since ke0, which determines the onset of drug action, varies according to the epoch length, it is necessary to consider the epoch length together when estimating ke0.

Timescales of Intrinsic BOLD Signal Dynamics and Functional Connectivity in Pharmacologic and Neuropathologic States of Unconsciousness.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2545-17.2018	Environmental events are processed on multiple timescales via hierarchical organization of temporal receptive windows (TRWs) in the brain. The dependence of neural timescales and TRWs on altered states of consciousness is unclear. States of reduced consciousness are marked by a shift toward slowing of neural dynamics (<1 Hz) in EEG/ECoG signals. We hypothesize that such prolongation of intrinsic timescales are also seen in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. To test this hypothesis, we measured the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals using mean frequency (MF) and temporal autocorrelation (AC) in healthy volunteers (n = 23; male/female 14/9) during graded sedation with propofol. We further examined the relationship between the intrinsic timescales (local/voxel level) and its regional connectivity (across neighboring voxels; regional homogeneity, ReHo), global (whole-brain level) functional connectivity (GFC), and topographical similarity (Topo). Additional results were obtained from patients undergoing deep general anesthesia (n = 12; male/female: 5/7) and in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) (n = 21; male/female: 14/7). We found that MF, AC, and ReHo increased, whereas GFC and Topo decreased, during propofol sedation. The local alterations occur before changes of distant connectivity. Conversely, all of these parameters decreased in deep anesthesia and in patients with DOC. We conclude that propofol synchronizes local neuronal interactions and prolongs the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals. These effects may impede communication among distant brain regions. Furthermore, the intrinsic timescales exhibit distinct dynamic signatures in sedation, deep anesthesia, and DOC. These results improve our understanding of the neural mechanisms of unconsciousness in pharmacologic and neuropathologic states.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Information processing in the brain occurs through a hierarchy of temporal receptive windows (TRWs) in multiple timescales. Anesthetic drugs induce a reversible suppression of consciousness and thus offer a unique opportunity to investigate the state dependence of neural timescales. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that sedation with propofol is accompanied by the prolongation of the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals presumably reflecting enlarged TRWs. We show that this is accomplished by an increase of local and regional signal synchronization, effects that may disrupt information exchange among distant brain regions. Furthermore, we show that the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals exhibit distinct dynamic signatures in sedation, deep anesthesia, and disorders of consciousness.

The impact of blackcurrant juice on attention, mood and brain wave spectral activity in young healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1080/1028415X.2017.1420539	There is a growing body of evidence from randomized controlled trials which indicates that consumption of berries has a positive effect upon the cognitive function of healthy adults. It has been recommended that studies combining cognitive and physiological measures be undertaken in order to strengthen the evidence base for the putative effects of flavonoid consumption on cognitive outcomes. This pilot study utilized a randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled crossover design to assess the influence of the acute administration of anthocyanin-rich blackcurrant juice, standardized at 500 mg of polyphenols, on mood and attention. Additionally, this trial used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess if any changes in cognitive performance are associated with changes in localized prefrontal cortex neuronal activity in nine healthy young adults. Outcomes from the pilot EEG data highlight an anxiolytic effect of the consumption of a single serve blackcurrant juice, as indexed by a suppression of α spectral power, and an increase in the slow wave δ and θ spectral powers. There was also an indication of greater alertness and lower fatigue, as indexed by an increase in β power and suppression of α spectral power. Outcomes from the CogTrack™ system indicated a small acute increase in reaction times during the digit vigilance task.

Evidence of hysteresis in propofol pharmacodynamics.	DOI: 10.1111/anae.14009	It is commonly assumed that loss of responsiveness and recovery of responsiveness occur at similar concentrations of propofol. However, the 'conscious' and 'anaesthetised' conditions produced by general anaesthetics may behave as two bistable states. We hypothesised that loss of responsiveness and recovery of responsiveness occur at different propofol concentrations. Propofol was administered to 19 healthy volunteers by effect-site target-controlled infusion using increasing and decreasing stable concentration steps of 7 min. Propofol serum concentrations were measured from venous blood samples at the end of each 7-min step. A long step of 14 min was performed at loss of responsiveness. At this step, propofol concentrations were measured at 7 and 14 min. Propofol concentrations measured at loss of responsiveness and recovery of responsiveness were 2.6 (1.2-4.7) μg.ml-1 and 1.6 (0.6-3.3) μg.ml-1 , respectively (p < 0.001). Propofol plasma concentration and the corresponding bispectral index values measured at minute 7 and minute 14 of the long step performed at loss of responsiveness were 2.6 (1.2-4.7) vs. 2.6 (1.3-4.3) at recovery of responsiveness, (p = 0.96) and 61.2 (49.0-77.0) vs. 58.4 (45.0-74.0), (p = 0.058), respectively. Loss of responsiveness and recovery of responsiveness appear to occur at different propofol concentrations. However, it is possible that, if equilibration was not achieved between plasma and effect-sites at the end of each 7-min step, the higher concentrations found at loss of responsiveness compared with those observed during recovery of responsiveness could be explained by a possible bias in estimations of the effect-site concentrations of propofol by the Schnider model, rather than neural inertia.

Assessing nitrous oxide effect using electroencephalographically-based depth of anesthesia measures cortical state and cortical input.	DOI: 10.1007/s10877-017-9978-1	Existing electroencephalography (EEG) based depth of anesthesia monitors cannot reliably track sedative or anesthetic states during n-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist based anesthesia with ketamine or nitrous oxide (N2O). Here, a physiologically-motivated depth of anesthesia monitoring algorithm based on autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) modeling and derivative measures of interest, Cortical State (CS) and Cortical Input (CI), is retrospectively applied in an exploratory manner to the NMDA receptor antagonist N2O, an adjuvant anesthetic gas used in clinical practice. Composite Cortical State (CCS) and Composite Cortical State distance (CCSd), two new modifications of CS, along with CS and CI were evaluated on electroencephalographic (EEG) data of healthy control individuals undergoing N2O inhalation up to equilibrated peak gas concentrations of 20, 40 or 60% N2O/O2. In particular, CCSd has been devised to vary consistently for increasing levels of anesthetic concentration independent of the anesthetic's microscopic mode of action for both N2O and propofol. The strongest effects were observed for the 60% peak gas concentration group. For the 50-60% peak gas levels, individuals showed statistically significant reductions in responsiveness compared to rest, and across the group CS and CCS increased by 39 and 42%, respectively, while CCSd was found to decrease by 398%. On the other hand a clear conclusion regarding the changes in CI could not be reached. These results indicate that, contrary to previous depth of anesthesia monitoring measures, the CS, CCS, and especially CCSd measures derived from frontal EEG are potentially useful for differentiating gas concentration and responsiveness levels in people under N2O. On the other hand, determining the utility of CI in this regard will require larger sample sizes and potentially higher gas concentrations. Future work will assess the sensitivity of CS-based and CI measures to other anesthetics and their utility in a clinical environment.

Directional connectivity between frontal and posterior brain regions is altered with increasing concentrations of propofol.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0113616	Recent studies using electroencephalography (EEG) suggest that alteration of coherent activity between the anterior and posterior brain regions might be used as a neurophysiologic correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. One way to assess causal relationships between brain regions is given by renormalized partial directed coherence (rPDC). Importantly, directional connectivity is evaluated in the frequency domain by taking into account the whole multichannel EEG, as opposed to time domain or two channel approaches. rPDC was applied here in order to investigate propofol induced changes in causal connectivity between four states of consciousness: awake (AWA), deep sedation (SED), loss (LOC) and return of consciousness (ROC) by gathering full 10/20 system human EEG data in ten healthy male subjects. The target-controlled drug infusion was started at low rate with subsequent gradual stepwise increases at 10 min intervals in order to carefully approach LOC (defined as loss of motor responsiveness to a verbal stimulus). The direction of the causal EEG-network connections clearly changed from AWA to SED and LOC. Propofol induced a decrease (p = 0.002-0.004) in occipital-to-frontal rPDC of 8-16 Hz EEG activity and an increase (p = 0.001-0.040) in frontal-to-occipital rPDC of 10-20 Hz activity on both sides of the brain during SED and LOC. In addition, frontal-to-parietal rPDC within 1-12 Hz increased in the left hemisphere at LOC compared to AWA (p = 0.003). However, no significant changes were detected between the SED and the LOC states. The observed decrease in back-to-front EEG connectivity appears compatible with impaired information flow from the posterior sensory and association cortices to the executive prefrontal areas, possibly related to decreased ability to perceive the surrounding world during sedation. The observed increase in the opposite (front-to-back) connectivity suggests a propofol concentration dependent association and is not directly related to the level of consciousness per se.

Neurophysiological correlates of sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness.	DOI: 10.1097/ALN.0000000000000482	Recent studies of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness in humans have focused predominantly on the intravenous drug propofol and have identified anterior dominance of alpha rhythms and frontal phase-amplitude coupling patterns as neurophysiological markers.

Neural correlates of successful semantic processing during propofol sedation.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.22375	Sedation has a graded effect on brain responses to auditory stimuli: perceptual processing persists at sedation levels that attenuate more complex processing. We used fMRI in healthy volunteers sedated with propofol to assess changes in neural responses to spoken stimuli. Volunteers were scanned awake, sedated, and during recovery, while making perceptual or semantic decisions about nonspeech sounds or spoken words respectively. Sedation caused increased error rates and response times, and differentially affected responses to words in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and the left inferior temporal gyrus (LITG). Activity in LIFG regions putatively associated with semantic processing, was significantly reduced by sedation despite sedated volunteers continuing to make accurate semantic decisions. Instead, LITG activity was preserved for words greater than nonspeech sounds and may therefore be associated with persistent semantic processing during the deepest levels of sedation. These results suggest functionally distinct contributions of frontal and temporal regions to semantic decision making. These results have implications for functional imaging studies of language, for understanding mechanisms of impaired speech comprehension in postoperative patients with residual levels of anesthetic, and may contribute to the development of frameworks against which EEG based monitors could be calibrated to detect awareness under anesthesia.

Cortical hypersynchrony predicts breakdown of sensory processing during loss of consciousness.	DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.017	Intrinsic cortical dynamics modulates the processing of sensory information and therefore may be critical for conscious perception. We tested this hypothesis by electroencephalographic recording of ongoing and stimulus-related brain activity during stepwise drug-induced loss of consciousness in healthy human volunteers. We found that progressive loss of consciousness was tightly linked to the emergence of a hypersynchronous cortical state in the alpha frequency range (8-14 Hz). This drug-induced ongoing alpha activity was widely distributed across the frontal cortex. Stimulus-related responses to median nerve stimulation consisted of early and midlatency response components in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and a late component also involving temporal and parietal regions. During progressive sedation, the early response was maintained, whereas the midlatency and late responses were reduced and eventually vanished. The antagonistic relation between the late sensory response and ongoing alpha activity held for constant drug levels on the single-trial level. Specifically, the late response component was negatively correlated with the power and long-range coherence of ongoing frontal alpha activity. Our results suggest blocking of intracortical communication by hypersynchronous ongoing activity as a key mechanism for the loss of consciousness.

Delta entropy of heart rate variability along with deepening anesthesia.

Approximate entropy of R-R intervals is an HRV measure that has a tendency to decrease during anesthesia, but it is severely compromised by low-frequency variations of the signal. However, the negative effect of the low-frequency variations can be eliminated by differentiating the R-R interval tachogram before analysis.

The correlation between BIS and the concentration of propofol in the brain, and the relationship between these subjective and objective tools in assessing sedation levels are the subject of this study.

Automated responsiveness monitor to titrate propofol sedation.	DOI: 10.1213/ane.0b013e3181b0fd0f	In previous studies, we showed that failure to respond to automated responsiveness monitor (ARM) precedes potentially serious sedation-related adversities associated with loss of responsiveness, and that the ARM was not susceptible to false-positive responses. It remains unknown, however, whether loss and return of response to the ARM occur at similar sedation levels. We hypothesized that loss and return of response to the ARM occur at similar sedation levels in individual subjects, independent of the propofol effect titration scheme.

Entropy during propofol hypnosis, including an episode of wakefulness.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2044.2004.03523.x	Depth of anaesthesia has proved to be a complex process to quantify. Monitors based on bispectral analysis of the electroencephalogram and auditory evoked potential have been available, but only recently has a monitor based on entropy become available. This study determined state entropy and response entropy in nine healthy volunteers during propofol hypnosis with a brief intervening period of wakefulness. Both the calculated entropy indices decreased with increasing levels of sedation (r2 = 0.58 and 0.61, respectively) and they showed a high correlation with each other (r2 = 0.94). However, an overlap was observed in real time indices between different stages of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale. Only three of the nine volunteers had explicit memories from the episode of wakefulness. Electroencephalographic entropy monitors seem to have potential for staging clinical hypnotic effects.

Propofol effective concentration 50 and its relationship to bispectral index.	DOI: 10.1046/j.0003-2409.2001.02446.x	Sixty unpremedicated healthy adult patients were studied during induction of anaesthesia with intravenous propofol delivered by a 'Diprifusor' target-controlled infusion. Bispectral index (BIS) and spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were measured concurrently with the predicted blood and effect site propofol concentrations. Logistic regression was used to calculate the predicted propofol blood and effect site concentrations required to produce unconsciousness and no response to a noxious stimulus in 50% and 95% of patients and to correlate BIS with these end-points. The Diprifusor TCI software produces anaesthesia at consistent target concentrations. Bispectral index correlates well with clinical end-points and may be useful during propofol anaesthesia.

Quantitative electroencephalographic analysis of the biphasic concentration-effect relationship of propofol in surgical patients during extradural analgesia.	DOI: 10.1093/bja/80.6.725	We studied effects on the EEG of propofol infused at a rate of 0.5 mg kg-1 min-1 for 10 min in 10 healthy male surgical patients under extradural analgesia. The EEG amplitude in six frequency bands was related to arterial blood propofol concentrations and responsiveness to verbal commands. The EEG amplitude showed a characteristic biphasic response to increasing blood propofol concentrations in all frequency bands. During the infusion, patients lost responsiveness when EEG amplitudes in the high frequency bands were decreasing after having reached a maximum. EEG changes were different during infusion and emergence. Pharmacodynamic modelling, using two effect compartments with dissimilar equilibration constants, resulted in satisfactory fits. We conclude that propofol exerts a biphasic effect on the EEG amplitude in all frequency bands. The dissimilarity of EEG changes during infusion and during emergence suggests that two effect compartments with different equilibration constants exert opposing effects on the EEG.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol in a new solvent.	DOI: 10.1097/00000539-199712000-00040	Pain on injection is the most commonly reported adverse event after propofol injection. In a randomized, cross-over study in two groups of 12 healthy male volunteers (24-42 yr), we compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two new propofol formulations (1% and 2% concentrations) in a fat emulsion consisting of medium- and long-chain triglycerides with the standard propofol formulation. After a single intravenous bolus injection of 2 mg/kg, propofol blood levels were measured for 24 h and evaluated according to an open three-compartment model. The derived pharmacokinetic variables were not different among formulations. Additionally, electroencephalographic recordings of the onset and duration of hypnotic action were comparable with all formulations. After propofol 1% in the new formulation, fewer volunteers reported severe or moderate pain on injection (9%) than after the standard formulation (59%) (P < 0.05). We attribute this result to a lower concentration of free propofol in the aqueous phase of the new formulation.

Electroencephalographic burst suppression by propofol infusion in humans: hemodynamic consequences.		The hemodynamic effects of a propofol infusion adjusted to achieve and maintain a burst-suppression pattern [episodes of depressed background activity (electrical silence) more than 4 s alternating with a high-voltage slow activity], were studied in 10 patients without cardiorespiratory disease undergoing elective neurosurgical interventions. Propofol infusion was started after a bolus dose of 1 mg/kg at a rate of 20 mg.kg-1 x h-1, reduced after 30 min to 15 mg.kg-1 x h-1, and terminated after 60 min (1926 +/- 346 mg cumulative propofol dose, maximal serum concentration 9.2 +/- 2.9 micrograms/dL; mean +/- SD). Hemodynamic data and arterial blood samples were collected during a sedated, resting control period, and then every 15 min during drug infusion. Lactated Ringer's solution was infused at a rate sufficient to maintain pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at or above control levels (20-30 mL.kg-1 x h-1). Burst-suppression pattern in the electroencephalogram was achieved after 15.7 +/- 3.2 min and maintained until 10.9 +/- 2.6 min after the propofol infusion was terminated. Significant decreases (% of control, Friedman and Wilcoxon Wilcox test, P < 0.05) were found in heart rate (19%), mean arterial pressure (20%), cardiac index (23%), and left ventricular stroke work index (26%). No adverse consequences were caused by the propofol or crystalloid infusion. The results demonstrate that doses of propofol sufficient to silence the electroencephalogram are associated with venodilating and myocardial depressant properties. However, propofol can be administered with minimal hemodynamic risk in healthy patients when cardiac filling pressures are maintained by intravenous fluid administration.

EEG and memory effects of low-dose infusions of propofol.	DOI: 10.1093/bja/69.3.246	The purpose of this study was to identify EEG changes associated with low-dose propofol infusion producing only sedative effects, and to describe the memory effects of low-dose propofol infusion. Ten healthy volunteers underwent EEG monitoring (at Fz, Cz, Pz and Oz electrode sites) before, during and after propofol 0.5 mg kg-1 i.v. bolus and 75 micrograms kg-1 min-1 as an infusion. Mean serum concentration of propofol during infusion was 0.86 (SD 0.14) micrograms ml-1. The EEG changed significantly during infusion, with increased power in the beta 1 (15-20 Hz), beta 2 (20.5-30 Hz) and delta (1-3.5 Hz) frequencies. Beta 1 and beta 2 power changes were most marked at the Fz and Cz electrodes. Subjects were sedated, but able to complete cognitive tasks. Visual analogue scales of attention and sleepiness were obtained throughout the study and demonstrated a sedative effect during propofol infusion, but were not a significant factor in memory performance or EEG changes. A verbal learning task (Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Task) administered before, during and after infusion showed a marked reduction in short-term memory capacity and dramatically impaired free recall and recognition during infusion. Nine of 10 subjects had partial amnesia for complex visual scenes presented during infusion, recalling less than 50% of the material. Stronger cueing was required to retrieve information presented during propofol infusion, with an increase in mean retrieval time from 95.4 (41.2) s to 426.8 (83.1) s.

Central analgesic effects of acetylsalicylic acid in healthy men.		Acetylsalicylic acid (CAS 50-78-2) (1000 mg orally) was investigated in a non-inflammatory experimental pain model in healthy male volunteers, selected for maximal homogeneity. Phasic pain was induced by intracutaneously applied electrical pulses of constant current. The nociceptive responses measured were, the pain ratings, the cerebral potentials and the EEG delta power in response to the stimuli. In addition, spontaneous EEG, auditory evoked potentials and reaction times were evaluated to determine effects upon the vigilance system. The study was performed in a placebo-controlled, double-blind repeated measures design. Blood samples were taken to monitor the plasma concentrations of the active agents. Acetylsalicylic acid produced clear analgesic effects in all pain relevant target variables. The effects increased with post-medication time, becoming significantly different from placebo 90 min after medication (p less than 0.01). At this time point the pain ratings were reduced by 4%, the pain related cerebral potentials by 15%, and the stimulus induced delta power of the EEG by 20%. These findings suggest a central action of acetylsalicylic acid by attenuation of experimentally induced nociceptive activity. No influences could be observed upon auditory evoked potentials, spontaneous EEG and reaction times. In other words, acetylsalicylic acid did not change vigilance by unspecific alterations of the CNS. The plasma concentration of acetylsalicylic acid reached mean values of 2.5 +/- 2.4 micrograms/ml within 25 min after oral medication, which remained constant during the entire post-medication period of 105 min.

A randomized cross-over trial to define neurophysiological correlates of AV-101 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockade in healthy veterans.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-020-00917-z	The kynurenine pathway (KP) is a strategic metabolic system that combines regulation of neuronal excitability via glutamate receptor function and neuroinflammation via other KP metabolites. This pathway has great promise in treatment of depression and suicidality. The KP modulator AV-101 (4-chlorokynurenine, 4-Cl-KYN), an oral prodrug of 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) glycine site antagonist, and of 4-chloro-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (4-Cl-3-HAA), a suppressor of NMDAR agonist quinolinic acid (QUIN), is a promising potential antidepressant that targets glutamate functioning via the KP. However, a recent placebo-controlled clinical trial of AV-101 in depression found negative results. This raises the question of whether AV-101 can penetrate the brain and engage the NMDAR and KP effectively. To address this problem, ten healthy US military veterans (mean age = 32.6 years ± 6.11; 1 female) completed a phase-1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to examine dose-related effects of AV-101 (720 and 1440 mg) on NMDAR engagement measured by γ-frequency band auditory steady-state response (40 Hz ASSR) and resting EEG. Linear mixed models revealed that 1440 mg AV-101, but not 720 mg, increased 40 Hz ASSR and 40 Hz ASSR γ-inter-trial phase coherence relative to placebo. AV-101 also increased 4-Cl-KYN, 7-Cl-KYNA, 4-Cl-3-HAA, 3-HAA, and KYNA in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting KYN and QUIN. AV-101 was safe and well tolerated. These results corroborate brain target engagement of 1440 mg AV-101 in humans, consistent with blockade of interneuronal NMDAR blockade. Future studies should test higher doses of AV-101 in depression. Suicidal behavior, which has been associated with high QUIN and low KYNA, is also a potential target for AV-101.

Inter-individual variability in neural response to low doses of LSD.	DOI: 10.1038/s41398-024-03013-8	"The repeated use of small doses of psychedelics (also referred to as ""microdosing"") to facilitate benefits in mental health, cognition, and mood is a trending practice. Placebo-controlled studies however have largely failed to demonstrate strong benefits, possibly because of large inter-individual response variability. The current study tested the hypothesis that effects of low doses of LSD on arousal, attention and memory depend on an individual's cognitive state at baseline. Healthy participants (N = 53) were randomly assigned to receive repeated doses of LSD (15 mcg) or placebo on 4 occasions divided over 2 weeks. Each treatment condition also consisted of a baseline and a 1-week follow-up visit. Neurophysiological measures of arousal (resting state EEG), pre-attentive processing (auditory oddball task), and perceptual learning and memory (visual long-term potentiation (LTP) paradigm) were assessed at baseline, dosing session 1 and 4, and follow-up. LSD produced stimulatory effects as reflected by a reduction in resting state EEG delta, theta, and alpha power, and enhanced pre-attentive processing during the acute dosing sessions. LSD also blunted the induction of LTP on dosing session 4. Stimulatory effects of LSD were strongest in individuals with low arousal and attention at baseline, while inhibitory effects were strongest in high memory performers at baseline. Decrements in delta EEG power and enhanced pre-attentive processing in the LSD treatment condition were still present during the 1-week follow-up. The current study demonstrates across three cognitive domains, that acute responses to low doses of LSD depend on the baseline state and provides some support for LSD induced neuroadaptations that sustain beyond treatment."

Modulation of long-term potentiation following microdoses of LSD captured by thalamo-cortical modelling in a randomised, controlled trial.	DOI: 10.1186/s12868-024-00844-5	Microdosing psychedelics is a phenomenon with claimed cognitive benefits that are relatively untested clinically. Pre-clinically, psychedelics have demonstrated enhancing effects on neuroplasticity, which cannot be measured directly in humans, but may be indexed by non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) paradigms. This study used a visual long-term potentiation (LTP) EEG paradigm to test the effects of microdosed lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on neural plasticity, both acutely while on the drug and cumulatively after microdosing every third day for six weeks. Healthy adult males (n = 80) completed the visual LTP paradigm at baseline, 2.5 h following a dose of 10 µg of LSD or inactive placebo, and 6 weeks later after taking 14 repeated microdoses. Visually induced LTP was used as indirect index of neural plasticity. Surface level event-related potential (ERPs) based analyses are presented alongside dynamic causal modelling of the source localised data using a generative thalamocortical model (TCM) of visual cortex to elucidate underlying synaptic circuitry.

Low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) increase reward-related brain activity.	DOI: 10.1038/s41386-022-01479-y	"Renewed interest in classic psychedelics as treatments for psychiatric disorders warrants a deeper understanding of their neural mechanisms. Single, high doses of psychedelic drugs have shown promise in treating depressive disorders, perhaps by reversing deficits in reward processing in the brain. In addition, there are anecdotal reports that repeated ingestion of low doses of LSD, or ""microdosing"", improve mood, cognition, and feelings of wellbeing. However, the effects of low doses of classic psychedelics on reward processing have not been studied. The current study examined the effects of two single, low doses of LSD compared to placebo on measures of reward processing. Eighteen healthy adults completed three sessions in which they received placebo (LSD-0), 13 μg LSD (LSD-13) and 26 μg LSD (LSD-26) in a within-subject, double-blind design. Neural activity was recorded while participants completed the electrophysiological monetary incentive delay task. Event-related potentials were measured during feedback processing (Reward-Positivity: RewP, Feedback-P3: FB-P3, and Late-Positive Potential: LPP). Compared to placebo, LSD-13 increased RewP and LPP amplitudes for reward (vs. neutral) feedback, and LSD-13 and LSD-26 increased FB-P3 amplitudes for positive (vs. negative) feedback. These effects were unassociated with most subjective measures of drug effects. Thus, single, low doses of LSD (vs. placebo) increased three reward-related ERP components reflecting increased hedonic (RewP), motivational (FB-P3), and affective processing of feedback (LPP). These results constitute the first evidence that low doses of LSD increase reward-related brain activity in humans. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of depressive disorders."

The impact of hearing aids and age-related hearing loss on auditory plasticity across three months - An electrical neuroimaging study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.heares.2017.06.012	The present study investigates behavioral and electrophysiological auditory and cognitive-related plasticity in three groups of healthy older adults (60-77 years). Group 1 was moderately hearing-impaired, experienced hearing aid users, and fitted with new hearing aids using non-linear frequency compression (NLFC on); Group 2, also moderately hearing-impaired, used the same type of hearing aids but NLFC was switched off during the entire period of study duration (NLFC off); Group 3 represented individuals with age-appropriate hearing (NHO) as controls, who were not different in IQ, gender, or age from Group 1 and 2. At five measurement time points (M1-M5) across three months, a series of active oddball tasks were administered while EEG was recorded. The stimuli comprised syllables consisting of naturally high-pitched fricatives (/sh/, /s/, and /f/), which are hard to distinguish for individuals with presbycusis. By applying a data-driven microstate approach to obtain global field power (GFP) as a measure of processing effort, the modulations of perceptual (P50, N1, P2) and cognitive-related (N2b, P3b) auditory evoked potentials were calculated and subsequently related to behavioral changes (accuracy and reaction time) across time. All groups improved their performance across time, but NHO showed consistently higher accuracy and faster reaction times than the hearing-impaired groups, especially under difficult conditions. Electrophysiological results complemented this finding by demonstrating longer latencies in the P50 and the N1 peak in hearing aid users. Furthermore, the GFP of cognitive-related evoked potentials decreased from M1 to M2 in the NHO group, while a comparable decrease in the hearing-impaired group was only evident at M5. After twelve weeks of hearing aid use of eight hours each day, we found a significantly lower GFP in the P3b of the group with NLFC on as compared to the group with NLFC off. These findings suggest higher processing effort, as evidenced by higher GFP, in hearing-impaired individuals when compared to those with normal hearing, although the hearing-impaired show a decrease of processing effort after repeated stimulus exposure. In addition, our findings indicate that the acclimatization to a new hearing aid algorithm may take several weeks.

Identification of BDNF sensitive electrophysiological markers of synaptic activity and their structural correlates in healthy subjects using a genetic approach utilizing the functional BDNF Val66Met polymorphism.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0095558	"Increasing evidence suggests that synaptic dysfunction is a core pathophysiological hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders. Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is key synaptogenic molecule and targeting synaptic repair through modulation of BDNF signalling has been suggested as a potential drug discovery strategy. The development of such ""synaptogenic"" therapies depend on the availability of BDNF sensitive markers of synaptic function that could be utilized as biomarkers for examining target engagement or drug efficacy in humans. Here we have utilized the BDNF Val66Met genetic polymorphism to examine the effect of the polymorphism and genetic load (i.e. Met allele load) on electrophysiological (EEG) markers of synaptic activity and their structural (MRI) correlates. Sixty healthy adults were prospectively recruited into the three genetic groups (Val/Val, Val/Met, Met/Met). Subjects also underwent fMRI, tDCS/TMS, and cognitive assessments as part of a larger study. Overall, some of the EEG markers of synaptic activity and brain structure measured with MRI were the most sensitive markers of the polymorphism. Met carriers showed decreased oscillatory activity and synchrony in the neural network subserving error-processing, as measured during a flanker task (ERN); and showed increased slow-wave activity during resting. There was no evidence for a Met load effect on the EEG measures and the polymorphism had no effects on MMN and P300. Met carriers also showed reduced grey matter volume in the anterior cingulate and in the (left) prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, anterior cingulate grey matter volume, and oscillatory EEG power during the flanker task predicted subsequent behavioural adaptation, indicating a BDNF dependent link between brain structure, function and behaviour associated with error processing and monitoring. These findings suggest that EEG markers such as ERN and resting EEG could be used as BDNF sensitive functional markers in early clinical development to examine target engagement or drug related efficacy of synaptic repair therapies in humans."

We investigate the association between the cerebellum volume and the presence of variant allele Valine at codon 129 of the Prnp gene in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS). The Prnp coding sequence was determined in 41 refractory MTLE-HS patients. The cerebellum volume corrected by the intracranial volume of patients with the normal Prnp genotypes was compared with that of patients presenting the variant alleles at codon 129. Twenty patients showed the Met129Met genotype, 16 showed Met129Val, and 5 had Val129Val. There were no association among clinical, demographic, electrophysiological, antiepileptic drugs used, and the presence of the Prnp variant alleles. The presence of Prnp variant allele at codon 129 was not associated with the analyzed cerebellum volume. Prnp variant alleles at codon 129 are not associated with cerebellum volume in patients with refractory MTLE-HS.

The Met-genotype of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with reduced Stroop interference in elderly.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.09.042	Aging is accompanied by impairments of executive functions that rely on the functional integrity of fronto-striatal networks. This integrity is modulated by the release of neurotrophins like the brain-derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, we investigate effects of the functional BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on interference processing in 131 healthy elderly subjects using event-related potentials (ERPs). In a Stroop task, participants had to indicate the name or the colour of colour-words while colour was either compatible or incompatible with the name. We show that susceptibility to Stroop-interference is affected by the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism: the Met-allele carriers showed better performance and enhanced N450 in interference trials. Other processes necessary to prepare and allocate cognitive resources to a particular task were not affected by BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, underlining the specificity of the observed effects. The observed performance and ERP difference is possibly due to dopamine related effects of BDNF in fronto-striatal networks, where it putatively mediates a shift in the balance of the direct and indirect pathway involved in inhibitory functions.

Paradoxical association of the brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor val66met genotype with response inhibition.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.12.022	Response inhibition is a basic executive function which is dysfunctional in various basal ganglia diseases. The brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor (BDNF) plays an important pathophysiological role in these diseases. In the current study we examined the functional relevance of the BDNF val66met polymorphism for response inhibition processes in 57 healthy human subjects using event-related potentials (ERPs), i.e. the Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3, which likely reflect different aspects of inhibition. Our results support the pre-motor inhibition theory of the Nogo-N2. We show that the BDNF val66met polymorphism selectively modulates the Nogo-N2. Response inhibition was better in the val/met-met/met group, since this group committed fewer false alarms, and their Nogo-N2 was larger, compared to the val/val group. This is the first study showing that met alleles of the BDNF val66met polymorphism confer an advantage for a specific cognitive function. We propose a neuronal model how this advantage gets manifest on a neuronal level.

The Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene influences trigeminal pain-related evoked responses.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpain.2012.05.014	Cortical pain processing is associated with large-scale changes in neuronal connectivity, resulting from neural plasticity phenomena of which brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a central driver. The common single nucleotide polymorphism Val66Met is associated with reduced BDNF activity. Using the trigeminal pain-related evoked potential (tPREP) to repeated electrical painful stimuli, we investigated whether the methionine substitution at codon 66 of the BDNF gene was associated with changes in cortical processing of noxious stimuli. Fifty healthy volunteers were genotyped: 30 were Val/Val and 20 were Met-carriers. tPREPs to 30 stimuli of the right supraorbital nerve using a concentric electrode were recorded. The N2 and P2 component latencies and the N2-P2 amplitude were measured over the 30 stimuli and separately, by dividing the measurements in 3 consecutive blocks of 10 stimuli. The average response to the 30 stimuli did not differ in latency or amplitude between the 2 genotypes. There was a decrease in the N2-P2 amplitude between first and third block in the Val/Val group but not in Met-carriers. BDNF Val66Met is associated with reduced decremental response to repeated electrical stimuli, possibly as a result of ineffective mechanisms of synaptic memory and brain plasticity associated with the polymorphism.

Association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and trait depression is mediated via resting EEG alpha band activity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2008.07.004	A functional polymorphism of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF Val66Met, is associated with risk for major depression alongside impairments in memory and selective attention. This study aims to identify the mediating neural mechanisms in links between BDNF and depression using highly heritable electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. In 305 healthy subjects, BDNF Val66Met genotypes were compared in terms of trait depression, neural function (EEG during a resting state) and cognitive performance. The mediating effects of the EEG brain imaging endophenotypes were also examined using structural equation (path) modeling. A genotype-endophenotype-phenotype path model showed that Met homozygosity predicted elevated working memory commission errors and altered EEG activity; that is elevated relative theta and delta power coupled with reduced alpha power. In turn, reduced EEG alpha activity mediated the relationship between the Met/Met genotype and trait depression. These findings demonstrate the utility of an integrative endophenotype approach. They suggest that the BDNF Met/Met homozygote has a direct impact on memory systems, but impacts trait depression via the secondary effects of neural changes.

Central Nervous System Processing of Floral Odor and Mother's Milk Odor in Infants.	DOI: 10.1093/chemse/bjab024	Newborns have a functioning sense of smell at birth, which appears to be highly significant for feeding and bonding. Still, little is known about the cerebral odor processing in this age group. Studies of olfactory function relied mostly on behavioral, autonomic, and facial responses of infants. The aim of the present study was to investigate central odor processing in infants focusing on electroencephalography (EEG)-derived responses to biologically significant odors, namely a food and a non-food odor. A total of 21 term-born, healthy infants participated (11 boys and 10 girls; age range 2-9 months, mean 5.3 ± 2.2 months). Odor stimuli were presented using a computer-controlled olfactometer. Breast milk was used as food odor. Farnesol was presented as a non-food odor. In addition, odorless air was used as a control stimulus. Each stimulus was presented 30 times for 1 s with an interstimulus interval of 20 s. EEG was recorded from 9 electrodes and analyzed in the frequency domain. EEG amplitudes in the delta frequency band differed significantly after presentation of food (breast milk) odor in comparison to the control condition and the non-food odor (farnesol). These changes were observed at the frontal recording positions. The present study indicates that central odor processing differs between a food and a non-food odor in infants. Results are interpreted in terms of focused attention towards a physiologically relevant odor (breast milk), suggesting that olfactory stimuli are of specific significance in this age group.

The Effect of Caffeine on Movement-Related Cortical Potential Morphology and Detection.	DOI: 10.3390/s24124030	Movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) is observed in EEG recordings prior to a voluntary movement. It has been used for e.g., quantifying motor learning and for brain-computer interfacing (BCIs). The MRCP amplitude is affected by various factors, but the effect of caffeine is underexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate if a cup of coffee with 85 mg caffeine modulated the MRCP amplitude and the classification of MRCPs versus idle activity, which estimates BCI performance. Twenty-six healthy participants performed 2 × 100 ankle dorsiflexion separated by a 10-min break before a cup of coffee was consumed, followed by another 100 movements. EEG was recorded during the movements and divided into epochs, which were averaged to extract three average MRCPs that were compared. Also, idle activity epochs were extracted. Features were extracted from the epochs and classified using random forest analysis. The MRCP amplitude did not change after consuming caffeine. There was a slight increase of two percentage points in the classification accuracy after consuming caffeine. In conclusion, a cup of coffee with 85 mg caffeine does not affect the MRCP amplitude, and improves MRCP-based BCI performance slightly. The findings suggest that drinking coffee is only a minor confounder in MRCP-related studies.

Slow release caffeine and prolonged (64-h) continuous wakefulness: effects on vigilance and cognitive performance.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-2869.2001.00266.x	Some long work or shift work schedules necessitate an elevated and prolonged level of vigilance and performance but often result in sleep deprivation (SD), fatigue and sleepiness, which may impair efficiency. This study investigated the effects of a slow-release caffeine [(SRC) at the daily dose of 600 mg] on vigilance and cognitive performance during a 64 h continuous wakefulness period. Sixteen healthy males volunteered for this double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled, two-way crossover study. A total of 300-mg SRC or placebo (PBO) was given twice a day at 21:00 and 9:00 h during the SD period. Vigilance was objectively assessed with continuous electroencephalogram (EEG), the multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) and wrist actigraphy. Cognitive functions (information processing and working memory), selective and divided attention were determined with computerised tests from the AGARD-NATO STRES Battery (Standardised Tests for Research with Environmental Stressors). Attention was also assessed with a symbol cancellation task and a Stroop's test; alertness was appreciated from visual analogue scales (VAS). Tests were performed at the hypo (02:00-04:00 h, 14:00-16:00 h) and hypervigilance (10:00-12:00 h, 22:00-00:00 h) periods during SD. Central temperature was continuously measured and safety of treatment was assessed from repeated clinical examinations. Compared with PBO, MSLT showed that SRC subjects were more vigilant from the onset (P=0.001) to the end of SD (P < 0.0001) whereas some cognitive functions were improved till the thirty third of SD but others were ameliorated through all the SD period and alertness was better from the thirteenth hour of SD, as shown by Stroop's test (P=0.048). We showed that 300-mg SRC given twice daily during a 64-h SD is able to antagonize the impairment produced on vigilance and cognitive functions.

Effects of single and repeated doses of theophylline on aspects of performance, electrophysiology and subjective assessments in healthy human subjects.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02253594	The effects of both single and repeated doses of theophylline were evaluated on a battery of nine performance tests, the EEG, the EMG and on subjective assessments of mood and side-effects. The subjects were 20 healthy adults who participated in both phases of this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover study. The single dose of 400 mg and the repeated doses of 300 mg b.d. for 4 weeks were intended to attain therapeutic serum concentrations. The Sternberg Additive Factors Method for assessing information processing revealed enhanced performance in both phases of this study, while the Horizontal Addition Test showed improved performance in the single dose phase only. The remaining seven performance tests failed to show significant differences between theophylline and placebo. Single doses of theophylline did not significantly alter mood, but marked adverse effects were encountered in the repeated dose phase, possibly related to unpleasant side-effects. Both EEG and EMG findings indicative of stimulation were associated with a single dose of theophylline, but substantial tolerance developed during 4 weeks of therapy. These findings demonstrate CNS stimulation by both single and repeated doses of theophylline with the occurrence of adverse side-effects during repeated administrations.

Radiofrequency signal affects alpha band in resting electroencephalogram.	DOI: 10.1152/jn.00765.2014	The aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of the radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on human resting EEG with a control of some parameters that are known to affect alpha band, such as electrode impedance, salivary cortisol, and caffeine. Eyes-open and eyes-closed resting EEG data were recorded in 26 healthy young subjects under two conditions: sham exposure and real exposure in double-blind, counterbalanced, crossover design. Spectral power of EEG rhythms was calculated for the alpha band (8-12 Hz). Saliva samples were collected before and after the study. Salivary cortisol and caffeine were assessed by ELISA and HPLC, respectively. The electrode impedance was recorded at the beginning of each run. Compared with the sham session, the exposure session showed a statistically significant (P < 0.0001) decrease of the alpha band spectral power during closed-eyes condition. This effect persisted in the postexposure session (P < 0.0001). No significant changes were detected in electrode impedance, salivary cortisol, and caffeine in the sham session compared with the exposure one. These results suggest that GSM-EMFs of a mobile phone affect the alpha band within spectral power of resting human EEG.

Acute effect of energy boost dietary supplement on P3 waveform: double blind, placebo controlled study.		Human cognition may be enhanced by energy drinks containing caffeine and/or other stimulants, which are thought to improve attentional as well as motor performance, and reduce reaction times. Due to the fact that literature shows that even low doses of caffeine may improve cognitive performance, we investigated an acute effect of a single dose of a caffeinated energy dietary supplement, on attention and motor responses by means of event related potentials. Healthy volunteers were examined in double blind, placebo controlled study. EEG recordings from 32 channels were performed in three sessions: before the supplementation (session 1), 30 min after the supplementation (session 2) and 90 min after the supplementation (session 3) in three tasks: visual P3, auditory P3, and motor task. Repeated measures ANOVA analysis showed reduced P3 amplitude increase after energy dietary supplementation (compared to placebo group) throughout all sessions (up to 90 min after consumption) in the visual task, and speeding the classification process observed as a decrease of P3 midpoint latency, but only 30 min after supplementation. The latter effect was present in both, but more pronounced in the visual task. Nonparametric cluster based permutation analysis showed one significant cluster in the placebo group from visual P3 task (approximately between 400 and 520 ms) over the centro‑parietal area, which was absent in the study group. Our results suggest that caffeinated energy dietary supplement containing only 55 mg of caffeine may enhance some attentional processes observed by changes in P3 features, but not in motor performance.

Caffeine effects on resting-state arousal in children.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2009.05.012	From previous work in our laboratory, increases in skin conductance level (SCL), together with global (across-scalp) decreases in electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha power and increases in alpha frequency, are useful indices of arousal increase, and here we sought to identify changes in these indices with caffeine ingestion in children. We explored the effects of a single oral dose of caffeine (80 mg) in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled repeated-measures cross-over study. Thirty healthy children aged between 8 and 13 years (mean age 10.5 years; 11 females) participated in two sessions, 1 week apart. EEG and SCL from a 3 min eyes-closed epoch, commencing approximately 30 min after ingestion of caffeine or placebo, were examined. Caffeine was associated with increased SCL, and a global reduction in EEG power in the theta and alpha bands, as well as topographically-focused reductions in delta and beta power, and a focal increase in alpha frequency. Only global alpha level demonstrated the expected inverse relationship with SCL in both placebo and caffeine conditions. These results are generally consistent with recent electrodermal and EEG studies of arousal. Together with our previous adult data, they indicate that caffeine can be used to increase arousal in both adults and children, without the potential confounds associated with varying task demands. Caffeine appears useful as a simple tool for manipulating arousal in studies exploring its role in physiological and behavioural functioning. This may be helpful in determining the role of hypothetical arousal anomalies in syndromes such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

A low- dose of caffeine suppresses EEG alpha power and improves working memory in healthy University males.	DOI: 10.1016/j.physbeh.2022.113955	The effects of a low dose of caffeine, administered in the morning, on brain wave activity and cognitive function were investigated in 25 healthy university Southeast Asian men (mean age ±standard deviation: 21 ± 2 years). Participants received a placebo (PLA) or a 50 mg caffeinated drink (CAF) under randomized, double-blind crossover conditions, with 1 week between conditions. Brain wave activity was assessed using electroencephalography (EEG) from a 5 min eyes-closed resting state. Cognitive function, i.e., visuomotor processing speed, working memory, and attention were assessed using the trail-making test A (Trails A) and B (Trails B), and digit span Forwards (DF), respectively. All tests were examined before drinking (BD), 30 min after drinking (AD), and 35 min after 5-min isokinetic exercise (AE). [Results] The CAF showed a significant decrease in the percentage changes from baseline (%∆) of alpha wave activity over the midline electrodes, i.e., frontal, central, and occipital areas after AD (p<0.05). Data from cognitive function tests were significantly improved after AD (p<0.05). A significant inverse correlation between the diminished alpha wave activity over the midline central and occipital cortical regions and the Trails B positive scores were observed (p<0.05). [Conclusion] The diminishment in resting alpha wave activity and improvement of cognitive function on working memory assessed by the Trails B following caffeine consumption would support the stimulant effects of low-dose caffeine as a morning wake-up drink in young adults.

The impact of daily caffeine intake on nighttime sleep in young adult men.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-021-84088-x	Acute caffeine intake can delay sleep initiation and reduce sleep intensity, particularly when consumed in the evening. However, it is not clear whether these sleep disturbances disappear when caffeine is continuously consumed during daytime, which is common for most coffee drinkers. To address this question, we investigated the sleep of twenty male young habitual caffeine consumers during a double-blind, randomized, crossover study including three 10-day conditions: caffeine (3 × 150 mg caffeine daily), withdrawal (3 × 150 mg caffeine for 8 days, then switch to placebo), and placebo (3 × placebo daily). After 9 days of continuous treatment, electroencephalographically (EEG)-derived sleep structure and intensity were recorded during a scheduled 8-h nighttime sleep episode starting 8 (caffeine condition) and 15 h (withdrawal condition) after the last caffeine intake. Upon scheduled wake-up time, subjective sleep quality and caffeine withdrawal symptoms were assessed. Unexpectedly, neither polysomnography-derived total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep architecture nor subjective sleep quality differed among placebo, caffeine, and withdrawal conditions. Nevertheless, EEG power density in the sigma frequencies (12-16 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement sleep was reduced in both caffeine and withdrawal conditions when compared to placebo. These results indicate that daily caffeine intake in the morning and afternoon hours does not strongly impair nighttime sleep structure nor subjective sleep quality in healthy good sleepers who regularly consume caffeine. The reduced EEG power density in the sigma range might represent early signs of overnight withdrawal from the continuous presence of the stimulant during the day.

Effects of caffeine on visual evoked potential (P300) and neuromotor performance.	DOI: 10.1590/s0004-282x2004000300002	The stimulant effects of caffeine on cognitive performance have been widely investigated. The visual evoked potential, specially the P300 component, has been used in studies that explain the stimulant mechanisms of caffeine through neurophysiological methods. In this context, the present study aimed to investigate electrophysiological changes (P300 latency) and modification of cognitive and motor performance produced by caffeine. Fifteen healthy volunteers, 9 women and 6 men (26 +/- 5 years, 67 +/- 12.5 kg) were submitted three times to the following procedure: electroencefalographic recording, Word Color Stroop Test, and visual discrimination task. Subjects took a gelatin caffeine capsule (400 mg) or a placebo (P1 and P2), in a randomized, crossover, double-blind design. A one-factor ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test were used to compare dependent variables on the C, P1 and P2 moments. The statistical analyses indicated a non-significant decrease in reaction time, Stroop execution time and latency at Cz on the caffeine moment when compared to the others. Moreover, a non-significant increase in Stroop raw score and latency at Pz could be observed. The only significant result was found at Fz. These findings suggest that the positive tendency of caffeine to improve cognitive performance is probably associated with changes in the frontal cortex, a widely recognized attention area.

Recovery after prolonged sleep deprivation: residual effects of slow-release caffeine on recovery sleep, sleepiness and cognitive functions.	DOI: 10.1159/000082851	A long work schedule often results in sleep deprivation, sleepiness, impaired performance and fatigue. We investigated the residual effects of slow-release caffeine (SRC) on sleep, sleepiness and cognitive performance during a 42-hour recovery period following a 64-hour continuous wakefulness period in 16 healthy males, according to a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Three hundred milligrams of SRC or placebo was given twice a day at 21:00 and 9:00 during the first 48 h of wakefulness. Recovery sleep was analysed with electroencephalography (EEG) and wrist actigraphy, daytime sleepiness with continuous EEG, sleep latency tests and actigraphy and cognitive functions with computerized tests from the NATO AGARD STRES battery. Both drug groups exhibited almost the same sleep architecture with a rebound of slow-wave sleep during both recovery nights and of REM sleep during the second night. Wakefulness level and cognitive functions were similarly impaired in both groups on the first day of recovery and partially returned to baseline on the second. To conclude, SRC appears to have no unwanted side-effects on recovery sleep, wakefulness and cognitive performance after a long period of sleep deprivation and might therefore be a useful choice over other psychostimulants for a long work schedule.

Effects of caffeine on topographic quantitative EEG.	DOI: 10.1159/000054958	Despite the widespread use of caffeine as a central nervous stimulant, the central pharmacodynamic properties of the drug have not yet been conclusively evaluated in humans. The present study was undertaken to assess the acute effects of caffeine on measures of topographical quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) in normal subjects. Ten healthy male volunteers (mean age +/- SD 25 +/- 4 years) received placebo and 200 mg of caffeine as powder with oral water solution (caffeine amount = 2 cups of coffee) under randomized, double-blind crossover conditions on two different occasions. Before administration and 30 min afterwards, a 17-channel quantitative EEG was recorded during relaxation with eyes open and closed (15 min each). Caffeine caused a significant reduction of total EEG power at fronto-parieto-occipital and central electrode positions of both hemispheres when the subjects kept their eyes open. Absolute power of the slow and fast alpha and slow beta activities was diminished in various regions of the brain (p < 0.05). The effect was more pronounced with the subjects keeping their eyes open than with eyes closed. It can be concluded that quantitative EEG is a sensitive method to assess the effects of psychostimulants on the human brain. Therefore, in pharmaco-EEG studies, environmental factors such as caffeine have to be excluded.

Dose-dependent pharmacokinetics and psychomotor effects of caffeine in humans.	DOI: 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1997.tb04356.x	Twelve healthy volunteers received oral placebo, 250 mg of caffeine, and 500 mg of caffeine in a randomized, double-blind, single-dose crossover study. Caffeine kinetics were nonlinear, with clearance significantly reduced and elimination half-life prolonged at the 500-mg compared to the 250-mg dose. The lower dose of caffeine produced more favorable subjective effects than the higher dose (elation, peacefulness, pleasantness), whereas unpleasant effects (tension, nervousness, anxiety, excitement, irritability, nausea, palpitations, restlessness) following the 500-mg dose exceeded those of the 250-mg dose. The lower dose of caffeine enhanced performance on the digit symbol substitution test and a tapping speed test compared to placebo; high-dose caffeine produced less performance enhancement than the lower dose. The plasma concentration versus response relationship revealed concentration-dependent increases in anxiety and improvements in cognitive and motor performance at low to intermediate concentrations. Both caffeine doses reduced electroencephalographic amplitude over the 4 Hz to 30 Hz spectrum, as well as in the alpha (8-11 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) ranges; however, effects were not dose-dependent. While favorable subjective and performance-enhancing stimulant effects occur at low to intermediate caffeine doses, the unfavorable subjective and somatic effects, as well as performance disruption, from high doses of caffeine may intrinsically limit the doses of caffeine used in the general population.

Alteration of Resting Electroencephalography by Acute Caffeine Consumption in Early Phase Psychosis.	DOI: 10.1177/15500594211057355	Individuals with schizophrenia use twice as much caffeine on average when compared to healthy controls. Knowing the high rates of consumption, and the potential negative effects of such, it is important we understand the cortical mechanisms that underlie caffeine use, and the consequences of caffeine use on neural circuits in this population. Using a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, repeated measures design, the current study examines caffeine's effects on resting electroencephalography (EEG) power in those who have been recently diagnosed with schizophrenia (SZ) compared to regular-using healthy controls (HC). Correlations between average caffeine consumption, withdrawal symptoms, drug related symptoms and clinical psychosis symptoms were measured and significant correlations with neurophysiological data were examined. Results showed caffeine had no effect on alpha asymmetry in the SZ group, although caffeine produced a more global effect on the reduction of alpha2 power in the SZ group. Further, those with more positive symptoms were found to have a greater reduction in alpha2 power following caffeine administration. Caffeine also reduced beta power during eyes closed and eyes open resting in HC, but only during eyes closed resting conditions in the SZ group. These findings provide a descriptive profile of the resting EEG state following caffeine administration in individuals with schizophrenia. The findings ultimately suggest caffeine does not affect alpha or beta power as readily in this population and a higher dose may be needed to achieve the desired effects, which may elucidate motivational factors for high caffeine use.

Differences in pharmacokinetic and electroencephalographic responses to caffeine in sleep-sensitive and non-sensitive subjects.	DOI: 10.1016/j.crvi.2006.01.006	The present study investigated pharmacokinetic and electroencephalographic responses to caffeine (140 mg) in two groups of healthy volunteers reporting, or not, caffeine-related sleep disturbances. Significant differences in caffeine consumption and smoking habits were observed between the two groups. Plasma samples were taken from each subject before (T0) and after caffeine intake at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. Three pharmacokinetic parameters: half-life (t1/2), maximum time (Tmax) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) were calculated from caffeine plasma concentration measurements determined by reversed phase HPLC analysis. Caffeine-sensitive subjects showed significantly greater half-life values when calculated on 24 h after the administration than tolerant subjects (p<0.05). Since the elimination kinetics were similar on the first 6 h after caffeine administration, the increased caffeine clearance observed overnight, when smoking was resumed in the control group, may indicate a short delay for the induction of hepatic cytochrome, reported here for the first time. Electrophysiological responses to caffeine, including vigilance and cortical activity, were assessed by ambulatory electroencephalographic (EEG) recorded during a period of 6 h before and after caffeine consumption. Following caffeine intake, the caffeine-intolerant subjects presented an increase in vigilance levels with faster peak alpha, beta frequency and lower delta and theta power when compared to tolerant subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters and EEG data showed significant differences between sleep-sensitive and control subjects. These variations may be, in part, explained by cigarette smoking and the higher caffeine intake observed in the subjects of the control groups while caffeine sleep-sensitive subjects have a significantly lower caffeine intake, as already reported in previous studies on patients with sleep disturbances.

Regular Caffeine Intake Delays REM Sleep Promotion and Attenuates Sleep Quality in Healthy Men.	DOI: 10.1177/07487304211013995	Acute caffeine intake can attenuate homeostatic sleep pressure and worsen sleep quality. Caffeine intake-particularly in high doses and close to bedtime-may also affect circadian-regulated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep promotion, an important determinant of subjective sleep quality. However, it is not known whether such changes persist under chronic caffeine consumption during daytime. Twenty male caffeine consumers (26.4 ± 4 years old, habitual caffeine intake 478.1 ± 102.8 mg/day) participated in a double-blind crossover study. Each volunteer completed a caffeine (3 × 150 mg caffeine daily for 10 days), a withdrawal (3 × 150 mg caffeine for 8 days then placebo), and a placebo condition. After 10 days of controlled intake and a fixed sleep-wake cycle, we recorded electroencephalography for 8 h starting 5 h after habitual bedtime (i.e., start on average at 04:22 h which is around the peak of circadian REM sleep promotion). A 60-min evening nap preceded each sleep episode and reduced high sleep pressure levels. While total sleep time and sleep architecture did not significantly differ between the three conditions, REM sleep latency was longer after daily caffeine intake compared with both placebo and withdrawal. Moreover, the accumulation of REM sleep proportion was delayed, and volunteers reported more difficulties with awakening after sleep and feeling more tired upon wake-up in the caffeine condition compared with placebo. Our data indicate that besides acute intake, also regular daytime caffeine intake affects REM sleep regulation in men, such that it delays circadian REM sleep promotion when compared with placebo. Moreover, the observed caffeine-induced deterioration in the quality of awakening may suggest a potential motive to reinstate caffeine intake after sleep.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to caffeine in poor and normal sleepers.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02246500	Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to caffeine (2.5 mg/kg) were compared between ten healthy self-rated poor sleepers and ten normal sleepers. Sleep pattern assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). There was no significant difference in mean estimated daily caffeine consumption between the groups. The poor sleepers had significantly higher scores for neuroticism on the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) and anxiety on the Hospital Anxiety Depression (HAD) scale, compared with normal sleepers. Caffeine pharmacokinetics were assessed by measurement of saliva caffeine concentrations. Poor sleepers showed significantly greater variability in caffeine Cmax, clearance had half-life, compared to normal sleepers. Pharmacodynamic measures included heart rate, blood pressure, visual analogue scales for concentration, vigilance and relaxation, psychomotor performance [Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and tapping rate (TR)] and EEG activity [Contingent negative variation (CNV), auditory evoked potential and power spectral analysis]. Prior to caffeine administration, poor sleepers compared to normal sleepers had faster heart rates, lower ratings for concentration and relaxation, poorer performance on the DSST, greater CNV magnitude, faster peak alpha frequency and lower delta, theta and beta power. These differences persisted after caffeine ingestion and overall differences between the groups on these measures were significant (P < 0.01-.001). Post-dose, but not pre-dose, scores for vigilance and TR were significantly lower overall in poor compared with normal sleepers. Despite the baseline differences between poor and normal sleepers, the changes following caffeine administration were similar in direction and magnitude in both groups.

The influence of caffeine on human EEG under resting conditions and during mental loads.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00180102	The effect of caffeine (single oral doses of 200 mg and 400 mg) on the CNS was tested under resting conditions and while performing a concentration performance test in a placebo-controlled pilot study on ten healthy males. The EEG was evaluated quantitatively by spectral analysis with a Computer Aided Topographical ElectroEncephaloMetry system. Comparison of the averaged frequency content revealed a clear difference between the change in the functional state of the brain due to the mental arithmetics, on the one hand, and the caffeine effect, on the other. Both states of altered brain activity were reflected in a particular topographical distribution of the frequency change with respect to a frontal-occipital accentuation. Comparison of the two periods of mental arithmetics in the absence or presence of caffeine showed a tendency to concentration-dependent differences from each other. Administration of 200 mg and 400 mg caffeine in the relaxed state effected the decrease in spectral power in the theta and alpha ranges. The concentration performance test without caffeine effected decreases in power in the alpha range in frontal to parietal cortex and enhanced theta power in frontal and occipital regions and the alpha power in occipital cortex. The caffeine-dependent decrease in theta power and the decrease in delta power seen under relaxation conditions after 400 mg are not observed during the concentration performance test in the presence of caffeine.

EEG Microstates in Early Phase Psychosis: The Effects of Acute Caffeine Consumption.	DOI: 10.1177/15500594221084994	Individuals with schizophrenia use on average twice as much caffeine than the healthy population, but the underlying cortical effects of caffeine in this population are still not well understood. Using resting electroencephalography (EEG) data, we can determine recurrent configurations of the electric field potential over the cortex. These configurations, referred to as microstates, are reported to be altered in schizophrenia and can give us insight into the functional dynamics of large-scale brain networks. In the current study, we use a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, repeated-measures design to examine the effects of a moderate dose of caffeine (200mg) on microstate classes A, B, C, and D in a sample of individuals within the first five years of psychosis onset compared to healthy controls. The results support the reduction of microstate class C and D, as well as the increase of microstate class A and B in schizophrenia. Further, acute caffeine administration appears to exacerbate these group differences by reducing class D, and increasing occurrences of class A and B states in the patient group only. The current results support the hypothesis of a microstate class D reduction as an endophenotypic marker for psychosis and provide the first descriptive account of how caffeine is affecting these microstate classes in an early phase psychosis sample.

Aging, caffeine, and information processing: an event-related potential analysis.	DOI: 10.1016/0168-5597(95)00069-5	Structural and energetic processes in information processing were studied in young and elderly subjects. A visually focussed selective search task was used, in which subjects had to select relevant information, followed by controlled memory search processes to locate a target item. Caffeine was used to manipulate the energetic state of the subjects. During task performance event-related potentials (ERPs) and reaction time (RT) were recorded. Subjects were 15 young and 15 elderly healthy, non-smoking, moderate caffeine consumers (250-600 mg/day). Before the experimental sessions they abstained from caffeine for > or = 12 h. In the experiment subjects received 250 mg caffeine or placebo dissolved in decaffeinated coffee. RT data seem to indicate that aging effects are at least partly due to a shift in the speed-accuracy trade-off. ERP results provide evidence for decreased levels of energy resources in the elderly. The identification of relevant information and stimulus evaluation processes were delayed in the elderly, suggesting an additional effect of aging on structural processes. Caffeine improved performance and increased the amplitude of the N1, N2b, and P3b, in both young and old subjects. These results suggest that caffeine makes more energy resources available for task performance. The effects of aging on P3b latency were counteracted by caffeine. Other caffeine effects did not differ significantly between young and elderly subjects.

Modulation of magnetoencephalography alpha band activity by radiofrequency electromagnetic field depicted in sensor and source space.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-021-02560-0	Several studies reported changes in spontaneous electroencephalogram alpha band activity related to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, but findings showed both an increase and a decrease of its spectral power or no effect. Here, we studied the alpha band modulation after 900 MHz mobile phone radiofrequency exposure and localized cortical regions involved in these changes, via a magnetoencephalography (MEG) protocol with healthy volunteers in a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced crossover design. MEG was recorded during eyes open and eyes closed resting-state before and after radiofrequency exposure. Potential confounding factors, known to affect alpha band activity, were assessed as control parameters to limit bias. Entire alpha band, lower and upper alpha sub-bands MEG power spectral densities were estimated in sensor and source space. Biochemistry assays for salivary biomarkers of stress (cortisol, chromogranin-A, alpha amylase), heart rate variability analysis and high-performance liquid chromatography for salivary caffeine concentration were realized. Results in sensor and source space showed a significant modulation of MEG alpha band activity after the radiofrequency exposure, with different involved cortical regions in relation to the eyes condition, probably because of different attention level with open or closed eyes. None of the control parameters reported a statistically significant difference between experimental sessions.

Mapping the pharmacological modulation of brain oxygen metabolism: The effects of caffeine on absolute CMRO2 measured using dual calibrated fMRI.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.03.028	This study aims to map the acute effects of caffeine ingestion on grey matter oxygen metabolism and haemodynamics with a novel MRI method. Sixteen healthy caffeine consumers (8 males, age=24.7±5.1) were recruited to this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Each participant was scanned on two days before and after the delivery of an oral caffeine (250mg) or placebo capsule. Our measurements were obtained with a newly proposed estimation approach applied to data from a dual calibration fMRI experiment that uses hypercapnia and hyperoxia to modulate brain blood flow and oxygenation. Estimates were based on a forward model that describes analytically the contributions of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and of the measured end-tidal partial pressures of CO2 and O2 to the acquired dual-echo GRE signal. The method allows the estimation of grey matter maps of: oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), CBF, CBF-related cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2). Other estimates from a multi inversion time ASL acquisition (mTI-ASL), salivary samples of the caffeine concentration and behavioural measurements are also reported. We observed significant differences between caffeine and placebo on average across grey matter, with OEF showing an increase of 15.6% (SEM±4.9%, p<0.05) with caffeine, while CBF and CMRO2 showed differences of -30.4% (SEM±1.6%, p<0.01) and -18.6% (SEM±2.9%, p<0.01) respectively with caffeine administration. The reduction in oxygen metabolism found is somehow unexpected, but consistent with a hypothesis of decreased energetic demand, supported by previous electrophysiological studies reporting reductions in spectral power with EEG. Moreover the maps of the physiological parameters estimated illustrate the spatial distribution of changes across grey matter enabling us to localise the effects of caffeine with voxel-wise resolution. CBF changes were widespread as reported by previous findings, while changes in OEF were found to be more restricted, leading to unprecedented mapping of significant CMRO2 reductions mainly in frontal gyrus, parietal and occipital lobes. In conclusion, we propose the estimation framework based on our novel forward model with a dual calibrated fMRI experiment as a viable MRI method to map the effects of drugs on brain oxygen metabolism and haemodynamics with voxel-wise resolution.

Cortical substrates of the effects of caffeine and time-on-task on perception of effort.	DOI: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00898.2013	Caffeine intake results in a decrease in perception of effort, but the cortical substrates of this perceptual effect of caffeine are unknown. The aim of this randomized counterbalanced double-blind crossover study was to investigate the effect of caffeine on the motor-related cortical potential (MRCP) and its relationship with rating of perceived effort (RPE). We also investigated whether MRCP is associated with the increase in RPE occurring over time during submaximal exercise. Twelve healthy female volunteers performed 100 intermittent isometric knee extensions at 61 ± 5% of their maximal torque 1.5 h after either caffeine (6 mg/kg) or placebo ingestion, while RPE, vastus lateralis electromyogram (EMG), and MRCP were recorded. RPE and MRCP amplitude at the vertex during the first contraction epoch (0-1 s) were significantly lower after caffeine ingestion compared with placebo (P < 0.05) and were significantly higher during the second half of the submaximal intermittent isometric knee-extension protocol compared with the first half (P < 0.05). No significant effects of caffeine and time-on-task were found for EMG amplitude and submaximal force output variables. The covariation between MRCP and RPE across both caffeine and time-on-task (r10 = -0.335, P < 0.05) provides evidence in favor of the theory that perception of effort arises from neurocognitive processing of corollary discharges from premotor and motor areas of the cortex. Caffeine seems to reduce perception of effort through a reduction in the activity of cortical premotor and motor areas necessary to produce a submaximal force, and time-on-task has the opposite effect.

Glycine attenuates impairments of stimulus-evoked gamma oscillations in the ketamine model of schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119004	Although a substantial number of studies suggests some clinical benefit concerning negative symptoms in schizophrenia through the modulation of NMDA-receptor function, none of these approaches achieved clinical approval. Given the large body of evidence concerning glutamatergic dysfunction in a subgroup of patients, biomarkers to identify those with a relevant clinical benefit through glutamatergic modulation are urgently needed. A similar reduction of the early auditory evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) as found in schizophrenia patients can be observed in healthy subjects following the application of an NMDA-receptor antagonist in the ketamine-model, which addresses the excitation / inhibition (E/I) imbalance of the disease. Moreover, this oscillatory change can be related to the emergence of negative symptoms. Accordingly, this study investigated whether glycine-related increases of the aeGBR, through NMDA-receptor co-agonism, accompany an improvement concerning negative symptoms in the ketamine-model. The impact of subanesthetic ketamine doses and the pretreatment with glycine was examined in twenty-four healthy male participants while performing a cognitively demanding aeGBR paradigm with 64-channel electroencephalography. Negative Symptoms were assessed through the PANSS. S-Ketamine alone caused a reduction of the aeGBR amplitude associated with more pronounced negative symptoms compared to placebo. Pretreatment with glycine attenuated both, the ketamine-induced alterations of the aeGBR amplitude and the increased PANSS negative scores in glycine-responders, classified based on relative aeGBR increase. Thus, we propose that the aeGBR represents a possible biomarker for negative symptoms in schizophrenia related to insufficient glutamatergic neurotransmission. This would allow to identify patients with negative symptoms, who might benefit from glutamatergic treatment.

Prolongation of QT interval by terbutaline in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1097/01.fjc.0000152031.38750.b1	In a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled crossover study, we characterized how terbutaline prolonged cardiac corrected QT interval (QTc). The study was carried out in six young and healthy male subjects in supine position. Escalating terbutaline doses were administered intravenously at infusion rates of 6 mL/h (10 microg terbutaline/min), 12 mL/h (20 microg terbutaline/min), and 18 mL/h (30 microg terbutaline/min). Terbutaline maximally prolonged QTc intervals on average by 60%, from 358 milliseconds (SD 28) to 456 milliseconds (SD 19). The effect was closely associated with a simultaneous decrease in plasma potassium concentration from 4.0 mmol/L (SD 0.1) to 2.5 mmol/L (SD 0.1). The final phase of slow ventricular repolarization, the interval between the apex and the end of T wave, was proven to be highly sensitive to the hypokalemic terbutaline actions, whereas the earlier repolarization phases were not strongly affected by terbutaline. Estimated by using the classic Nernst equation for membrane potentials, terbutaline-induced hypokalemia hyperpolarized ventricular myocardium from the resting level of -90 mV to -110 mV. The prolongation of QTc interval was related to ventricular hyperpolarization with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91. Terbutaline-induced prolongation of QTc interval in healthy volunteers is in conformity with repolarization studies carried out in isolated canine heart ventricular preparations in which the cardiac ventricular cell membrane potential determines the duration of the final phase of slow ventricular repolarization.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide affects homeostatic sleep regulation in healthy young men.	DOI: 10.1152/ajpendo.00152.2006	Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) is involved in autonomous regulation, including timekeeping, by its action on the suprachiasmatic nucleus and on neuroendocrine secretion, energy metabolism, and transmitter release. In particular, the interactions between PACAP and the glutamatergic system are well recognized. We compared the effect of intravenously administered PACAP to that of placebo in eight healthy male subjects. PACAP in a concentration of 4x12.5 microg was administered in a pulsatile fashion hourly between 2200 and 0100. Sleep EEG was recorded from 2300 to 1000, which was also the time when subjects were allowed to sleep. Blood samples were taken every 20 min between 2200 and 0700 for the determination of cortisol, GH, and prolactin. PACAP administration led to no changes in the macro-sleep structure as assessed according to standard criteria. Spectral analysis revealed a significant reduction in the theta-frequency range in the first 4-h interval and of the spindle frequency range in the second 4-h interval of the registration period. This was accompanied by an increase in the time constant tau of the physiological delta-power decline in the course of the night, i.e., a less pronounced dynamic of the reduction of delta-power with time. This was accompanied by a trend (P<0.1) toward decreased prolactin secretion in the first 4-h period of the night. No other changes in endocrine secretion were observed. We concluded that PACAP leads to a reduction of the dynamics of homeostatic sleep regulation and prolactin secretion. Both effects are the opposite of those seen after sleep deprivation but similar to the changes after napping, i.e., a reduced sleep propensity. This implies that PACAP might be involved in homeostatic sleep regulation.

A novel method for efficient estimation of brain effective connectivity in EEG.

While the connectivity may be classified as structural, functional and causal, a complete in-vivo directional analysis is guaranteed by the latter and is referred to as Effective Connectivity (EC). Two most widely used EC techniques are Directed Transfer Function (DTF) and Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) which are based on multivariate autoregressive models. The drawbacks of these techniques include poor frequency resolution and the requirement for experimental approach to determine signal normalization and thresholding techniques in identifying significant connectivities between multivariate sources.

The effect of selective REM-sleep deprivation on the consolidation and affective evaluation of emotional memories.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nlm.2015.02.008	Emotion boosts the consolidation of events in the declarative memory system. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is believed to foster the memory consolidation of emotional events. On the other hand, REM sleep is assumed to reduce the emotional tone of the memory. Here, we investigated the effect of selective REM-sleep deprivation, SWS deprivation, or wake on the affective evaluation and consolidation of emotional and neutral pictures. Prior to an 9-h retention interval, sixty-two healthy participants (23.5 ± 2.5 years, 32 female, 30 male) learned and rated their affect to 80 neutral and 80 emotionally negative pictures. Despite rigorous deprivation of REM sleep or SWS, the residual sleep fostered the consolidation of neutral and negative pictures. Furthermore, emotional arousal helped to memorize the pictures. The better consolidation of negative pictures compared to neutral ones was most pronounced in the SWS-deprived group where a normal amount of REM sleep was present. This emotional memory bias correlated with REM sleep only in the SWS-deprived group. Furthermore, emotional arousal to the pictures decreased over time, but neither sleep nor wake had any differential effect. Neither the comparison of the affective ratings (arousal, valence) during encoding and recognition, nor the affective ratings of the recognized targets and rejected distractors supported the hypothesis that REM sleep dampens the emotional reaction to remembered stimuli. The data suggest that REM sleep fosters the consolidation of emotional memories but has no effect on the affective evaluation of the remembered contents.

Antagonists that target both receptors have been shown to promote sleep initiation and maintenance. Here, we investigated the role of the orexin-2 receptor in sleep regulation in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period crossover clinical trial using two doses (20 and 50 mg) of a highly selective orexin-2 receptor antagonist (2-SORA) (JNJ-48816274). We used a phase advance model of sleep disruption where sleep initiation is scheduled in the circadian wake maintenance zone. We assessed objective and subjective sleep parameters, pharmacokinetic profiles and residual effects on cognitive performance in 18 healthy male participants without sleep disorders. The phase advance model alone (placebo condition) resulted in disruption of sleep at the beginning of the sleep period compared to baseline sleep (scheduled at habitual time). Compared to placebo, both doses of JNJ-48816274 significantly increased total sleep time, REM sleep duration and sleep efficiency, and reduced latency to persistent sleep, sleep onset latency, and REM latency. All night EEG spectral power density for both NREM and REM sleep were unaffected by either dose. Participants reported significantly better quality of sleep and feeling more refreshed upon awakening following JNJ-48816274 compared to placebo. No significant residual effects on objective performance measures were observed and the compound was well tolerated. In conclusion, the selective orexin-2 receptor antagonist JNJ-48816274 rapidly induced sleep when sleep was scheduled earlier in the circadian cycle and improved self-reported sleep quality without impact on waking performance.

CSF-hypocretin-1 levels in patients with major depressive disorder compared to healthy controls.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psychres.2011.06.004	Depressive patients exhibit symptoms of impaired regulation of wakefulness with hyperarousal and agitation as well as difficulties to falling asleep and preserving sleep continuity. Changes in hypocretin (hcrt) levels as polypeptides with impact on arousal and sleep-wake-regulation have been discussed in affective disorders but have not been investigated in patients with solely unipolar depression in comparison to healthy controls. In the present study, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of hcrt-1 for the first time were analyzed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) without psychiatric comorbidities and compared with levels in healthy controls. In 17 inpatients with MDD (mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 13.9 ± 7.4) and 10 healthy controls, CSF-hcrt-1 levels were measured using a fluorescence immunoassay (FIA). The mean hcrt-1 CSF levels in patients with MDD (74.3 ± 17.8pg/ml) did not differ compared to that of healthy controls (82.8 ± 22.1pg/ml). Hcrt-1 levels did not correlate with the severity of depressive episode, the symptoms of depression or the number of episodes. Although autonomic and neurohumoral signs of hyperarousal are common in MDD, hcrt-1 levels in CSF were not found to be altered in MDD compared to healthy controls. Whether hcrt-1 levels are altered in depressive patients exhibiting impaired vigilance regulation has to be investigated in further studies combining measures of CSF-hcrt-1 with electroencephalography.

Rasmussen's syndrome and new-onset narcolepsy, cataplexy, and epilepsy in an adult.	DOI: 10.1016/j.yebeh.2003.08.030	We report a case of new-onset seizures and narcolepsy in a previously healthy 40-year-old man. He developed severe daytime somnolence and cataplexy over the course of a few months. Brain MRI was normal, and polysomnography with multiple sleep latency testing confirmed a diagnosis of narcolepsy. His HLA haplotype is DQB1*0602 and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed no detectable hypocretin. Approximately 18 months later, he developed complex partial seizures. Further MRI showed a progressively enlarging lesion involving the left frontotemporal and insular areas. Pathology from a partial resection was consistent with Rasmussen's syndrome. Evaluation for tumor, infectious, and paraneoplastic etiologies was negative. There was no further progression of the residual lesion on serial MRI. Although the pathophysiologic bases of narcolepsy and Rasmussen's syndrome are unknown, they may have an autoimmune basis. This unique case of both disorders in a single patient suggests the possibility of a common underlying disease process.

Association of BRD2 polymorphisms with photoparoxysmal response.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2006.02.026	A trait locus for electroencephalographic photoparoxysmal response (PPR) has been mapped to the chromosomal region 6p21 near a susceptibility locus for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Linkage disequilibrium mapping revealed strong associations between JME and polymorphisms of the gene encoding the bromodomain-containing protein 2 (BRD2). The present association study tested whether genetic variation of BRD2 confers also susceptibility to PPR. All study participants were of German descent, comprising 187 subjects exhibiting PPR (types I-IV) and 666 healthy controls. Genotypes of each study participant were assessed for seven single nucleotide polymorphisms and one dinucleotide repeat polymorphism, covering the genomic BRD2 sequence. Allelic and haplotypic associations were found between PPR and six BRD2 polymorphisms (P: 0.0075-0.035). Considering the strong neurobiological association of JME and PPR, the present results support evidence that PPR and JME share epileptogenic pathways, for which BRD2 might be an underlying susceptibility gene.

State-dependent regulation of cortical activity by cortisol: an EEG study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2006.05.038	In the present study we investigated the effects of cortisol administration on EEG activity in eight healthy volunteers. We administered 35 mg of cortisol in a within-subjects double-blind placebo-controlled design. Cortisol administration caused a global decrease in cortical activity except for an increase frontally at the left, resulting in a significant change in frontal asymmetry. This pattern of results is almost the exact mirror image of one of our previous studies. Comparing subjective activation measures from the present and previous study showed that activation was substantially higher in the present study that was performed in formal testing conditions involving venipuncture, compared to the previous EEG study that was performed in non-formal testing conditions. However, the direction of the present cortisolinduced change in frontal activity asymmetry is consistent with the cortisolinduced change in asymmetric rotation behavior that we recently reported in similar testing conditions. We also found indications that, in contrast to the effects on the EEG measures, effects of cortisol administration on subjective anxiety and plasma oxytocin levels may be sex-dependent. These results are preliminary because of the post-hoc nature and the small number of subjects in the present study. However, they are in line with recent findings by others, suggesting that the effects of cortisol on cortical activity and subjective activation are state dependent and are influenced by testing conditions.

Post-trial administration of vasopressin in humans does not enhance memory formation (vasopressin and memory consolidation).	DOI: 10.1016/s0196-9781(01)00625-8	Many animal studies show an enhancing effect of vasopressin (VP) on memory, but not all human studies could confirm this finding. This study examined the influence of post-learning administration of VP (40 IU, intranasally) on the consolidation of declarative memories in healthy humans during different intervals of sleep and waking. We could not find any effect of VP on memory consolidation, but EEG activity indicated a significant arousing influence of VP. Results suggest that if VP affects memory function it might do so primarily at the stage of encoding of the materials to be learned but it leaves unaffected processes of consolidation.

EEG-driven photic stimulation effect on plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin.	DOI: 10.1023/a:1026215910176	The effect of EEG-driven photic stimulation on stress-related endocrine function was studied. Subjects were 16 healthy males divided into a photic stimulation group (n = 8) and a control group (n = 8). Electrodermal and emotional lability measures were assessed by nonspecific skin conductance response and the Maudsley Personality Inventory, respectively. Plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin concentrations were measured both before and after EEG-driven photic stimulation as well as the resting condition. Subjects with electrodermal, emotional, or both lability showed comparable decreases of plasma beta-endorphin on photic stimulation as did the stable subjects. Under resting control conditions, however, they showed significant increases of beta-endorphin compared to both stable subjects as well as the photic stimulation condition. In addition, labile subjects showed significant alpha enhancement on photic stimulation compared to stable subjects and to the resting control condition. The data suggest that increases of plasma beta-endorphin in labile control subjects may denote a stress response to the conditions of these experiments, and that any decrease by EEG-driven photic stimulation may indicate a reduction of responsiveness to an acute stress.

Brain oscillatory functioning after long-term alcohol abstinence.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2022.05.015	The heterogeneity of the population with alcohol use disorder (AUD) sometimes makes the knowledge generated in areas such as neuroscience appear to be contradictory. One aspect that may help elucidate this apparent contradiction is controlling for certain variables that are not usually controlled, such as the abstinence time in people with AUD. This research aims to study the neuroelectrical oscillations in people with AUD with longer and shorter abstinence time in comparison with healthy individuals. We recruited twenty-nine individuals with AUD with abstinence time longer than fifteen days and shorter than six months (STA), twenty-six individuals with AUD with abstinence time longer than six months and shorter than thirteen months (LTA), and sixteen healthy individuals (HC). All participants underwent electroencephalographic recording in resting-state with eyes closed. The oscillatory activity obtained was analyzed to obtain the spectral power and phase synchronization level. Regarding the obtained spectral power results, these revealed that the STA group showed higher theta band power and lower alpha band power than the LTA and HC groups. The obtained results at the phase synchronization level also show two main results. On the one hand, the STA group showed lower alpha band phase synchronization than the LTA and HC groups. On the other hand, the HC group showed higher beta band phase synchronization than the STA and LTA groups. In conclusion, the obtained results reflect that abstinence maintenance for six or more months appears to produce an important oscillatory brain functioning normalization in people with AUD.

Cancellation but not restraint ability is modulated by trait anxiety: An event-related potential and oscillation study using Go-Nogo and stop-signal tasks.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jad.2021.11.066	Trait anxiety has a detrimental effect on attention, which further leads to dysfunction of inhibitory control. However, there is no study examining how trait anxiety modulates inhibitory abilities on restraint and cancellation in the same subjects. Therefore, we aimed to use electrophysiological recordings to interrogate whether and to what extent trait anxiety modulated these two kinds of inhibitory functions. The Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), a self-reported assessment of daily absentmindedness, was also used to examine its association with inhibition-related electrophysiological indicators.

Acute central effects of the calcium channel blocker and antiglutamatergic drug caroverine. Double-blind, placebo-controlled, EEG mapping and psychometric studies after intravenous and oral administration.		In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the effects of caroverine (CAS 23465-76-1, Spasmium)--a quinoxaline derived from isoquinoline, the basic structure of papaverine, originally developed as a spasmolytic drug which may, however, exert central effects due to an unspecific calcium channel blocking action and glutamate antagonism--were investigated utilizing EEG-mapping, psychometric and psychophysiological measures. Fifteen healthy volunteers (8 males and 7 females), aged 20-35 years, received randomized and at weekly intervals 40 and 80 mg caroverine intravenously, 40 and 80 mg caroverine orally, as well as placebo. EEG recordings, psychometric and psychophysiological tests, as well as evaluation of pulse, blood pressure and side-effects were carried out at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. Multivariate analysis of EEG mapping data demonstrated that caroverine exerted a significant action on human brain function, as compared with placebo, at all given dosages, as early as in the 1st and as late as in the 8th hour after both intravenous and oral administration during resting (R-EEG) and vigilance-controlled recording (V-EEG). Subsequent univariate analyses revealed, however, differential effects of caroverine--dependent on recording conditions and doses. In the resting condition, an increase of absolute and relative delta and theta power, a decrease of alpha and beta power and a slowing of the centroid of the delta and theta activity occurred, reflecting sedative action. The latter was slightly time- and dose-dependent (more sedation in earlier hours after higher doses). However, in the vigilance-controlled EEG, a dose-dependent decrease of delta and theta power, an increase of alpha power and an acceleration of the centroid of the delta and theta suggested vigilance-promoting effects, which were more pronounced in the later than earlier hours. Psychometric investigations confirmed these differential central effects. In regard to the noopsyche, an improvement was noted 6 h after the lowest oral dose. In the thymopsyche, a deterioration occurred after all doses except the highest oral dose, suggesting sedation. The latter was also seen after all active compounds as a trend in psychophysiological variables. The drug was well tolerated.

Association between fat-soluble nutrient status and auditory and visual related potentials in newly diagnosed non-screened infants with cystic fibrosis: A case-control study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.plefa.2019.09.003	Nutritional deficiencies often precede the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in infants, and occur at a stage where the rapidly developing brain is more vulnerable to insult. We aim to compare fat-soluble nutrient status of newly diagnosed non-screened infants with CF to that of healthy infants, and explore the association with neurodevelopment evaluated by electroencephalography (EEG). Our results show that CF infants had lower levels of all fat-soluble vitamins and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared to controls. The auditory evoked potential responses were higher in CF compared to controls whereas the visual components did not differ between groups. DHA levels were correlated with auditory evoked potential responses. Although resting state frequency power was similar between groups, we observed a negative correlation between DHA levels and low frequencies. This study emphasizes the need for long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up of CF infants and pursuing intervention strategies in the future.

A longitudinal study on the impact of high-altitude hypoxia on perceptual processes.	DOI: 10.1111/psyp.14548	This study aimed to explore the neural mechanisms underlying high-altitude (HA) adaptation and deadaptation in perceptual processes in lowlanders. Eighteen healthy lowlanders were administered a facial S1-S2 matching task that included incomplete face (S1) and complete face (S2) photographs combined with ERP technology. Participants were tested at four time points: shortly before they departed the HA (Test 1), twenty-five days after entering the HA (Test 2), and one week (Test 3) and one month (Test 4) after returning to the lowlands. Compared with those at sea level (SL), shorter reaction times (RTs), shorter latencies of P1 and N170, and larger amplitudes of complete face N170 were found in HAs. After returning to SL, compared with that of HA, the amplitude of the incomplete face P1 was smaller after one week, and the complete face was smaller after one month. The right hemisphere N170 amplitude was greater after entering HA and one week after returning to SL than at baseline, but it returned to baseline after one month. Taken together, the current findings suggest that HA adaptation increases visual cortex excitation to accelerate perceptual processing. More mental resources are recruited during the configural encoding stage of complete faces after HA exposure. The perceptual processes affected by HA exposure are reversible after returning to SL, but the low-level processing stage differs between incomplete and complete faces due to neural compensation mechanisms. The configural encoding stage in the right hemisphere is affected by HA exposure and requires more than one week but less than one month to recover to baseline.

Subclinical epileptiform activity in the Alzheimer continuum: association with disease, cognition and detection method.	DOI: 10.1186/s13195-023-01373-9	Epileptic seizures are an established comorbidity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subclinical epileptiform activity (SEA) as detected by 24-h electroencephalography (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG) has been reported in temporal regions of clinically diagnosed AD patients. Although epileptic activity in AD probably arises in the mesial temporal lobe, electrical activity within this region might not propagate to EEG scalp electrodes and could remain undetected by standard EEG. However, SEA might lead to faster cognitive decline in AD.

Postural control paradigm (BioVRSea): towards a neurophysiological signature.	DOI: 10.1088/1361-6579/ac9c43	Objective.To define a new neurophysiological signature from electroencephalography (EEG) during a complex postural control task using the BioVRSea paradigm, consisting of virtual reality (VR) and a moving platform, mimicking the behavior of a boat on the sea.Approach.EEG (64 electrodes) data from 190 healthy subjects were acquired. The experiment is composed of 6 segments (Baseline, PRE, 25%, 50%, 75%, POST). The baseline lasts 60 s while standing on the motionless platform with a mountain view in the VR goggles. PRE and POST last 40 s while standing on the motionless platform with a sea simulation. The 3 other tasks last 40 s each, with the platform moving to adapt to the waves, and the subject holding a bar to maintain its balance. The power spectral density (PSD) difference for each task minus baseline has been computed for every electrode, for five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and low-gamma). Statistical significance has been computed.Main results.All the bands were significant for the whole cohort, for each task regarding baseline. Delta band shows a prefrontal PSD increase, theta a fronto-parietal decrease, alpha a global scalp power decrease, beta an increase in the occipital and temporal scalps and a decrease in other areas, and low-gamma a significant but slight increase in the parietal, occipital and temporal scalp areas.Significance.This study develops a neurophysiological reference during a complex postural control task. In particular, we found a strong localized activity associated with certain frequency bands during certain phases of the experiment. This is the first step towards a neurophysiological signature that can be used to identify pathological conditions lacking quantitative diagnostics assessment.

Effect of Body Positions on EEG signals in Mal de Debarquement Syndrome.	DOI: 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512699	Multimodal neuroimaging, such as combined electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are being increasingly used to investigate the human brain in healthy and diseased conditions. However, certain neuroimaging data are typically acquired in different body positions, e.g., supine fMRI and upright EEG, overlooking the effect of body position on signal characteristics. In the current study we examined EEG signals in three different positions, i.e., supine, standing and sitting, in patients with a balance disorder called mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS). Individuals with MdDS experience a chronic illusion of self-motion triggered by prolonged exposure to passive motion, such as from sea or air travel. The degree of perception of rocking dizziness is modulated by body position, suggesting a physiological effect related to body positions. In the present study, EEG features were quantified as peak frequency, peak amplitude, and average amplitude of the alpha band due to its strongest signal characteristics compared to other frequencies. The effect of body position was examined in EEG features from data acquired before and after the individuals received treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Our results indicate a significant effect of body positions on the EEG signals in MdDS.

Modulating neural oscillations by transcranial static magnetic field stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: A crossover, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot study.	DOI: 10.1111/ejn.14232	Transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) is a novel non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has been shown to locally increase alpha power in the parietal and occipital cortex. We investigated if tSMS locally increased alpha power in the left or right prefrontal cortex, as the balance of left/right prefrontal alpha power (frontal alpha asymmetry) has been linked to emotional processing and mood disorders. Therefore, altering frontal alpha asymmetry with tSMS may serve as a novel treatment to psychiatric diseases. We performed a crossover, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot study to assess the effects of prefrontal tSMS on neural oscillations. Twenty-four right-handed healthy participants were recruited and received left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tSMS, right DLPFC tSMS, and sham tSMS in a randomized order. Electroencephalography data were collected before (2 min eyes-closed, 2 min eyes-open), during (10 min eyes-open), and after (2 min eyes-open) stimulation. In contrast with our hypothesis, neither left nor right tSMS locally increased frontal alpha power. However, alpha power increased in occipital cortex during left DLPFC tSMS. Right DLPFC tSMS increased post-stimulation fronto-parietal theta power, indicating possible relevance to memory and cognition. Left and right DLPFC tSMS increased post-stimulation left hemisphere beta power, indicating possible changes to motor behavior. Left DLPFC tSMS also increased post-stimulation right frontal beta power, demonstrating complex network effects that may be relevant to aggressive behavior. We concluded that DLPFC tSMS modulated the network oscillations in regions distant from the location of stimulation and that tSMS has region specific effects on neural oscillations.

Effects of cable car ascent to 2700 meters on mean EEG frequency and event-related desynchronization (ERD).	DOI: 10.1007/s10354-005-0161-9	In the Eastern Alps, the Dachstein massif with a height of almost 3000 m is an ideal location for investigating the effects of changes in altitude on the human body. A cable car allows an ascent within a few minutes to 2700 m, where the partial pressure of oxygen is about 550 mm of mercury compared to 760 mm at sea level. Ten healthy subjects performed a reaction time task at an altitude of 990 m and 2700 m. The subjects were instructed to perform a right hand index finger movement as fast as possible after a green light had flashed. The green light flashed 50 times. Simultaneously to the task, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The event-related desynchronization (ERD) analysis of the EEG data showed that changes in alpha ERD values are not significant, but event-related synchronization (ERS) values in the beta band decrease significantly from around 50 % to 10 %. Furthermore, the mean frequency of the beta band increased from 16.68 Hz to 16.81 Hz (p = 0.0019) with the ascent. The suppressed post-movement beta ERS at an altitude of 2700 m may therefore be interpreted as a result of an increased cortical excitability level when compared with the reference altitude of 990 m above sea level.

Effects of a fast cable car ascent to an altitude of 2700 meters on EEG and ECG.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2004.11.065	In the Eastern Alps, the Dachstein massif with a height of almost 3000 m is an ideal location for investigating the effects of changes in altitude on the human body. Within a few minutes, a cable car facilitates an ascent from 1702 to 2700 m above sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is about 550 mmHg (as compared to 760 mmHg at sea level). In this study, 10 healthy subjects performed a reaction time task at 990 m and 2700 m in altitude. The subjects were instructed to perform a right hand index finger movement as fast as possible after a green light flashed (repeated 50 times). The corresponding electrocardiogram (ECG) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. From the ECG heart rate and heart rate variability measures in the time and frequency domain were calculated. An event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis was performed with the EEG data. Finally, the EEG activity and the ECG parameters were correlated. The study showed that with the fast ascent to 2700 m the heart rate increased and the heart rate variability measures decreased. The correlation analysis indicated a close relationship between the EEG activity and the heart rate and heart rate variability. Furthermore it was shown for the first time that the beta ERS in the 14-18 Hz frequency range (post-movement beta ERS) was significantly reduced at high altitude. Very interesting also is the loss of correlation between EEG activity and cardiovascular measures during finger movement at high altitude. The suppressed post-movement beta ERS at the altitude of 2700 m may be interpreted as results of an increased cortical excitability level when compared with the reference altitude at 990 m above sea level.

Effects of zolpidem and zaleplon on sleep, respiratory patterns and performance at a simulated altitude of 4,000 m.	DOI: 10.1159/000076723	The effects of zolpidem or zaleplon on sleep architecture, respiratory patterns and performance were assessed at a simulated altitude of 4,000 m. Twelve male healthy subjects spent 4 nights in a decompression chamber, 1 at sea level (baseline), 3 at 4,000 m to test zolpidem (10 mg), zaleplon (10 mg) and placebo, given 15 min before switching the lights off. Sleep and respiratory patterns were analysed using polysomnography. Cognitive and physical performance was examined the next morning at sea level conditions. The study demonstrates that both zolpidem and zaleplon improved slow wave sleep at altitude, with zolpidem showing more marked effects than zaleplon. Both agents did not adversely affect respiration at altitude during the night, or cognitive or physical performance the next morning at the dosages used in this study. Thus, climbers may safely use both hypnotic agents.

Sleep of Andean high altitude natives.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00717957	The structure of sleep in lowland visitors to altitudes greater than 4000 m is grossly disturbed. There are no data on sleep in long-term residents of high altitudes. This paper describes an electroencephalographic study of sleep in high altitude dwellers who were born in and are permanent residents of Cerro de Pasco in the Peruvian Andes, situated at 4330 m. Eight healthy male volunteers aged between 18 and 69 years were studied. Sleep was measured on three consecutive nights for each subject. Electroencephalographs, submental electromyographs and electro-oculograms were recorded. Only data from the third night were used in the analysis. The sleep patterns of these subjects resembled the normal sleep patterns described by others in lowlanders at sea level. There were significant amounts of slow wave sleep in the younger subjects and rapid eye movement sleep seemed unimpaired.

Electroencephalographic and evoked potential monitoring in the hyperbaric environment.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02832177	The purpose of this study was to investigate brain bioelectrical activity during hyperbaric oxygenation by continuous and simultaneous monitoring of electroencephalographic and bimodal (auditory, somatosensory) evoked potentials. Multivariable recordings (electroencephalogram, brainstem auditory evoked potentials, early somatosensory evoked potentials, heart rate, heart rate variability, and transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen) were measured with a new technique in 12 healthy male volunteers 26 to 52 years old (mean +/- SD, 35.9 +/- 9.5 years). Recordings were obtained while the subjects breathed (1) air at normal atmospheric pressure, (2) 100% oxygen at normal atmospheric pressure, (3) air at 2 atm (10 meters sea water [msw]), and (4) 100% oxygen at 2 atm (10 msw). Spontaneous brain electrical activity, somatosensory evoked potentials, and heart rate variability were not significantly affected during hyperbaric oxygenation, whereas the heart rate showed a significant decrease (paired t test, P less than 0.05). Alterations in brainstem auditory evoked potentials were seen under hyperbaric conditions and did not reach statistical significance (increase of the I-V interpeak latency by paired t test; P less than 0.2). All subjects showed insignificant increases in dominant alpha frequency and decreases in delta frequency under hyperbaric situations.

Effects of acute oral Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and standardized cannabis extract on the auditory P300 event-related potential in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2008.04.008	Reduced amplitudes of auditory evoked P300 are a robust finding in schizophrenic patients, indicating deficient attentional resource allocation and active working memory. Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC), the main active constituent of Cannabis sativa, has been known to acutely impair cognitive abilities in several domains, particularly in memory and attention. Given the psychotic-like effects of Delta9-THC, a cannabinoid hypothesis of schizophrenia has been proposed. This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study investigated the acute effects of cannabinoids on P300 amplitude in 20 healthy volunteers (age 28.2+/-3.1 years, 10 male) by comparing Delta9-THC and standardized cannabis extract containing Delta9-THC and cannabidiol (CBD). P300 waves were recorded during a choice reaction task. As expected, Delta9-THC revealed a significant reduction of P300 amplitude at midline frontal, central, and parietal electrodes. CBD has been known to abolish many of the psychotropic effects of Delta9-THC, but, unexpectedly, failed to demonstrate a reversal of Delta9-THC-induced P300 reduction. Moreover, there were no correlations between cannabinoid plasma concentrations and P300 parameters. These data suggest that Delta(9)-THC may lead to acute impairment of attentional functioning and working memory. It can be speculated whether the lack of effect of CBD may be due to an insufficient dose used or to an involvement of neurotransmitter systems in P300 generation which are not influenced by CBD.

Acute effects of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and standardized cannabis extract on the auditory evoked mismatch negativity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.schres.2007.08.015	Reduced amplitudes of auditory evoked mismatch negativity (MMN) have often been found in schizophrenic patients, indicating deficient auditory information processing and working memory. Cannabis-induced psychotic states may resemble schizophrenia. Currently, there are discussions focusing on the close relationship between cannabis, the endocannabinoid and dopaminergic system, and the onset of schizophrenic psychosis. This study investigated the effects of cannabis on MMN amplitude in 22 healthy volunteers (age 28+/-6 years, 11 male) by comparing Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) and standardized cannabis extract containing Delta(9)-THC and cannabidiol (CBD) in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design. The MMNs resulting from 1000 auditory stimuli were recorded by 32 channel EEG. The standard stimuli were 1000 Hz, 80 dB SPL, and 100 ms duration. The deviant stimuli differed in frequency (1500 Hz). Significantly greater MMN amplitude values at central electrodes were found under cannabis extract, but not under Delta(9)-THC. There were no significant differences between MMN amplitudes at frontal electrodes. MMN amplitudes at central electrodes were significantly correlated with 11-OH-THC concentration, the most important psychoactive metabolite of Delta(9)-THC. Since the main difference between Delta(9)-THC and standardized cannabis extract is CBD, which seems to have neuroprotective and anti-psychotic properties, it can be speculated whether the greater MMN amplitude that may imply higher cortical activation and cognitive performance is related to the positive effects of CBD. This effect may be relevant for auditory cortex activity in particular because only MMN amplitudes at the central, but not at the frontal electrodes were enhanced under cannabis.

Association between a cannabinoid receptor gene (CNR1) polymorphism and cannabinoid-induced alterations of the auditory event-related P300 potential.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2011.04.003	Numerous studies demonstrated a close relationship between cannabis abuse and schizophrenia with similar impairments in cognitive processing, particularly in P300 generation. Recently, an (AAT)n triplet repeat polymorphism within the cannabinoid receptor gene CNR1 has been found to be associated with both schizophrenia and substance dependence, and to modulate the P300 potential. As previously reported, both acute oral Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and standardized cannabis extract containing Δ(9)-THC and cannabidiol (CBD) revealed a significant reduction of P300 amplitudes in healthy subjects but did not show any differences among each other. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the (AAT)n polymorphism differentially modulates the effects of Δ(9)-THC and cannabis extract on P300 generation in 20 healthy volunteers during an auditory choice reaction task. For the >10/>10 genotype, there was a significant decrease of P300 amplitude as well as a significant prolongation of P300 latency under pure Δ(9)-THC but not under cannabis extract. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between the number of AAT repeats and P300 variables for the Δ(9)-THC condition. Our data thus indicate that the CNR1 gene seems to be involved in the regulation of the P300 wave as a marker of selective attention and working memory. Moreover, it appears that variations within CNR1 may differentially alter the sensitivity to the acute effects of cannabinoids on P300 generation in healthy subjects.

Effects of inhalation of essential oils on EEG activity and sensory evaluation.	DOI: 10.2114/jpa.19.35	"The purpose of this study was to investigate EEG changes in subjects directly after inhalation of essential oils, and subsequently, to observe any effect on subjective evaluations. EEG and sensory evaluation were assessed in 13 healthy female subjects in four odor conditions. Four odor conditions (including lavender, chamomile, sandalwood and eugenol) were applied respectively for each subject in the experiment. The results were as follows. 1) Four basic factors were extracted from 22 adjective pairs by factor analysis of the sensory evaluation. The first factor was ""comfortable feeling"", the second ""cheerful feeling"", the third ""natural feeling"" and the fourth ""feminine feeling"". In the score of the first factor (comfortable feeling), the odors in order of high contribution are lavender, eugenol, chamomile and sandalwood. 2) Alpha 1 (8-10 Hz) of EEG at parietal and posterior temporal regions significantly decreased soon after the onset of inhalation of lavender oil (p < 0.01). Significant changes of alpha 1 were also observed after inhalation of eugenol or chamomile. The change after inhalation of sandalwood was not significant. These results showed that alpha 1 activity significantly decreased under odor conditions in which subjects felt comfortable, and showed no significant change under odor conditions in which subjects felt uncomfortable.

Drug-induced arterial pressure elevation is associated with arousal from NREM sleep in normal volunteers.	DOI: 10.1152/jappl.1999.87.3.897	Abrupt changes in arterial pressure produce arousal in sleeping animals. To determine whether arterial pressure elevations can cause arousal from sleep in humans, we studied five healthy individuals without sleep complaints or cardiac abnormalities. Monitoring included electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, and electromyogram to determine stage sleep; finger cuff to measure arterial pressure; and electrocardiogram to measure heart rate. We administered intravenous bolus doses of either phenylephrine or saline after performing a dose-response curve to establish the amount of phenylephrine that produced a 20-mmHg increase in mean arterial pressure. Ten boluses of phenylephrine and ten boluses of saline were then administered in random order during stable non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. An observer blinded to the order of drug administration identified arousals using a standard definition. Arousals were five times more likely to occur after phenylephrine than after saline (58 vs. 12%; P = 0.0071). Phenylephrine administration produced heart rate slowing, indicative of baroreflex stimulation. We conclude that pharmacologically induced arterial pressure elevation is associated with arousal from sleep in normal volunteers.

Support-vector classification of low-dose nitrous oxide administration with multi-channel EEG power spectra.	DOI: 10.1007/s10877-023-01054-w	Support-vector machines (SVMs) can potentially improve patient monitoring during nitrous oxide anaesthesia. By elucidating the effects of low-dose nitrous oxide on the power spectra of multi-channel EEG recordings, we quantified the degree to which these effects generalise across participants. In this single-blind, cross-over study, 32-channel EEG was recorded from 12 healthy participants exposed to 0, 20, 30 and 40% end-tidal nitrous oxide. Features of the delta-, theta-, alpha- and beta-band power were used within a 12-fold, participant-wise cross-validation framework to train and test two SVMs: (1) binary SVM classifying EEG during 0 or 40% exposure (chance = 50%); (2) multi-class SVM classifying EEG during 0, 20, 30 or 40% exposure (chance = 25%). Both the binary (accuracy 92%) and the multi-class (accuracy 52%) SVMs classified EEG recordings at rates significantly better than chance (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively). To determine the relative importance of frequency band features for classification accuracy, we systematically removed features before re-training and re-testing the SVMs. This showed the relative importance of decreased delta power and the frontal region. SVM classification identified that the most important effects of nitrous oxide were found in the delta band in the frontal electrodes that was consistent between participants. Furthermore, support-vector classification of nitrous oxide dosage is a promising method that might be used to improve patient monitoring during nitrous oxide anaesthesia.

Analysis of brain connectivity during nitrous oxide sedation using graph theory.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-020-59264-0	Nitrous oxide, the least potent inhalation anesthetic, is widely used for conscious sedation. Recently, it has been reported that the occurrence of anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness decreases the interconnection between brain regions, resulting in brain network changes. However, few studies have investigated these changes in conscious sedation using nitrous oxide. Therefore, the present study aimed to use graph theory to analyze changes in brain networks during nitrous oxide sedation. Participants were 20 healthy volunteers (10 men and 10 women, 20-40 years old) with no history of systemic disease. We acquired electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of 32 channels during baseline, nitrous oxide inhalation sedation, and recovery. EEG epochs from the baseline and the sedation state (50% nitrous oxide) were extracted and analyzed with the network connection parameters of graph theory. Analysis of 1/f dynamics, revealed a steeper slope while in the sedation state than during the baseline. Network connectivity parameters showed significant differences between the baseline and sedation state, in delta, alpha1, alpha2, and beta2 frequency bands. The most pronounced differences in functional distance during nitrous oxide sedation were observed in the alpha1 and alpha2 frequency bands. Change in 1/f dynamics indicates that changes in brain network systems occur during nitrous oxide administration. Changes in network parameters imply that nitrous oxide interferes with the efficiency of information integration in the frequency bands important for cognitive processes and attention tasks. Alteration of brain network during nitrous oxide administration may be associated to the sedative mechanism of nitrous oxide.

Investigating the effects of nitrous oxide sedation on frontal-parietal interactions.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2017.04.036	Although functional connectivity has received considerable attention in the study of consciousness, few studies have investigated functional connectivity limited to the sedated state where consciousness is maintained but impaired. The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in functional connectivity of the parietal-frontal network resulting from nitrous oxide-induced sedation, and to determine the neural correlates of cognitive impairment during consciousness transition states. Electroencephalography was acquired from healthy adult patients who underwent nitrous oxide inhalation to induce cognitive impairment, and was analyzed using Granger causality (GC). Periods of awake, sedation and recovery for GC between frontal and parietal areas in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma and total frequency bands were obtained. The Friedman test with post-hoc analysis was conducted for GC values of each period for comparison. As a sedated state was induced by nitrous oxide inhalation, power in the low frequency band showed increased activity in frontal regions that was reversed with discontinuation of nitrous oxide. Feedback and feedforward connections analyzed in spectral GC were changed differently in accordance with EEG frequency bands in the sedated state by nitrous oxide administration. Calculated spectral GC of the theta, alpha, and beta frequency regions in the parietal-to-frontal direction was significantly decreased in the sedated state while spectral GC in the reverse direction did not show significant change. Frontal-parietal functional connectivity is significantly affected by nitrous oxide inhalation. Significantly decreased parietal-to-frontal interaction may induce a sedated state.

Nitrous oxide paradoxically modulates slow electroencephalogram oscillations: implications for anesthesia monitoring.	DOI: 10.1213/ANE.0b013e318227b688	Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is one of the oldest analgesics/adjuvant agents still in use today; however, its effects on the human electroencephalogram (EEG) remain unclear. It has been proposed that N(2)O may enhance higher-frequency EEG activity (often indicative of alert states and cognition) duration sedation. This possibly paradoxical effect has been used to explain the failure of many EEG monitors to capture the effects of N(2)O on patient state during anesthesia. To better understand the poor efficacy of current EEG approaches to monitoring N(2)O action, we quantitatively studied the sole effect of N(2)O on the resting EEG in healthy volunteers using multichannel EEG recordings under noise-minimized laboratory conditions.

Bispectral EEG index monitoring of high-dose nitrous oxide and low-dose sevoflurane sedation.		This single-blind controlled clinical study characterized the effects of 30-70% nitrous oxide (N2O) and 0.2-0.8% sevoflurane conscious sedation on quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) readings of 22 healthy dental students as measured by the bispectral index (BIS). The study verified the 2 previously published BIS/N2O investigations showing no correlation between N2O dosage up to 70% and BIS. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scores (OAA/S), however, correlated well with increasing doses of N2O from approximately 35 to 70%. A near linear dose-response relationship was established between OAA/S and end tidal (ET) sevoflurane concentrations of 0.4-0.7%. Only at the highest level of end tidal sevoflurane recorded, 0.7%, was statistically significant BIS depression seen. Subjects evaluated the acceptability of the sedative effect of the 2 gases, showing a slight preference for N2O. Comparable partial anterograde amnesia and sedation (OAA/S) were produced by both agents in administered concentrations of 40-70% N2O and 0.6-0.8% sevoflurane. Female subjects exhibited better memory and significantly less amnesia than males. No statistically significant changes occurred in any of the monitored vital signs. EMG readings demonstrated a statistically significant difference from control values only at the highest, 0.7%, ET concentration of sevoflurane. BIS does not appear useful for evaluating the level of nitrous oxide sedation in the dental setting but may have some value in assessing depth of sedation at deeper levels of sevoflurane sedation.

Sleep apnea-like syndrome induced by nitrous oxide inhalation in normal men.	DOI: 10.1016/s0034-5687(97)00026-1	To study the relationship between sedation and respiration under N2O, we performed polysomnographic recordings in 15 healthy men with documented normal breathing patterns during sleep. In a first study in five subjects, we found that 50% N2O in O2 compared to 50% O2 increased sleep latency to stage 2 (59 +/- 12 vs. 17 +/- 3 min), total sleep duration (59 +/- 12 vs. 26 +/- 11 min), depth of sleep and respiratory events during sleep (18 +/- 5 vs. 1 +/- 1/h of sleep). In a second study, ten subjects were exposed to N2O (30 and 50%) in O2 during two consecutive experimental periods. Eight subjects had EEG features of physiological sleep, but nevertheless exhibited a total of 181 respiratory events. Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) during sleep was similar under 30 and 50% N2O (25 +/- 7 and 25 +/- 5/h of sleep, respectively). Obstructive events predominated, except in three subjects during N2O 30% and one during N2O 50% exposure. We conclude that N2O can induce central and obstructive sleep apneas.

Effects of hyperbilirubinemia on cerebrocortical electrical activity in newborns.	DOI: 10.1203/00006450-200207000-00023	In our study, cerebrocortical electrical activity was recorded as an indicator of bilirubin neurotoxicity. Bilirubin especially affects the thalamus and cerebral cortex. Inasmuch as rhythmic oscillations on the EEG arise from the interaction between cortex and thalamus, electrophysiologic effects of bilirubin on the rhythmic oscillations with long-term postnatal age were investigated. Brain maturation was also analyzed with power spectral analysis quantitatively. For this purpose, 141 EEG records were taken (in the first week, 15th d, at the end of the first month, and at the third month) from 17 infants with hyperbilirubinemia and 22 healthy infants. In all records, the major frequency component was formed by the delta frequency in both groups. In the first records of the hyperbilirubinemia group, the delta frequency was higher than the control group; however the theta, alpha, and beta frequencies and the amplitude levels were lower (p < 0.001). These changes were found to be significantly correlated with the bilirubin levels (p < 0.001). On the 15th d the amplitude of the hyperbilirubinemia group increased to similar levels as the control group. At the frequency bands of delta and theta, there were significant changes related to postnatal age (p < 0.001). In all cerebral regions, the delta frequency decreased and the theta frequency increased with age. However, in the hyperbilirubinemia group the delta frequency was higher, the theta frequency was lower, and the changes between the groups disappeared in the third month despite the differences at all regions of the brain. In terms of the vertex, k complex, and sleep spindle, there were no differences between both groups in the third month (p > 0.05). We conclude that hyperbilirubinemia affects the cerebrocortical electrical activity but appears to be time limited.

Suppression of Low-Frequency Gamma Oscillations by Activation of 40-Hz Oscillation.	DOI: 10.1093/cercor/bhab381	Gamma oscillations have received considerable attention owing to their association with cognitive function and various neuropsychiatric disorders. However, interactions of gamma oscillations at different frequency bands in humans remain unclear. In the present magnetoencephalographic study, brain oscillations in a wide frequency range were examined using a time-frequency analysis during the 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-Hz auditory stimuli in 21 healthy subjects. First, dipoles for auditory steady-state response (ASSR) were estimated and interaction among oscillations at 10-60 Hz was examined using the source strength waveforms. Results showed the suppression of ongoing low-gamma oscillations at approximately 30 Hz during stimulation at 40 Hz. Second, multi-dipole analyses suggested that the main dipole for ASSR and dipoles for suppressed low-frequency gamma oscillations were distinct. Third, an all-sensor analysis was performed to clarify the distribution of the 40-Hz ASSR and suppression of low-frequency gamma oscillations. Notably, the area of suppression surrounded the center of the 40-Hz ASSR and showed a trend of extending to the vertex, indicating that different groups of neurons were responsible for these two gamma oscillations and that the 40-Hz oscillation circuit have specific inhibitory innervation to the low-gamma circuit.

A possible association of responsiveness to adrenocorticotropic hormone with specific GRIN1 haplotypes in infantile spasms.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1469-8749.2010.03746.x	Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has been used as the major therapy for infantile spasms since 1958 because it effectively suppresses seizures; it also normalizes the electroencephalogram in the short-term treatment of infantile spasms. G protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (GRIN1, also known as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1, NMDAR1), a glutamate receptor, is the main component of functional N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors that are involved in the glucocorticoid-induced neuronal damage. Thus, it may be a candidate gene to be tested for responsiveness to ACTH in infantile spasms. In the present study, polymorphisms in the GRIN1 gene in infantile spasms were investigated using a case-control design.

Correlation of auditory event-related potentials and magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures in mild cognitive impairment.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2010.04.078	This study was aimed to examine the changes in auditory event-related potentials (AERPs) and their relationship with brain metabolic changes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 34 MCI patients and 34 healthy elderly controls were subjected to auditory stimulus oddball task, and then post-stimulus potentials (P50, N100, P200, N200, and P300) were obtained, levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr) and the ratio of NAA/Cr were measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in left frontal, left temporal and right parietal cortex. Compared with the control group, the MCI group had significantly increased P50 amplitudes and P300 latency, and the NAA/Cr was abnormal. Linear progression analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between P50 amplitudes and NAA/Cr in left frontal cortex, and negative correlation between P300 latency and NAA/Cr in left frontal and left temporal, as well as correlation of AERP components and MRS metabolites with clinical scores of cognitive tests. These findings suggest that metabolic abnormalities of different brain regions may reflect the changes of underlying brain activities that are instrumental in the MCI. Therefore AERPs and MRS measurements may offer a mean to track changes of brain activities associated with functional changes, and to assess early cognitive impairment in MCI.

Preliminary findings of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in occipital cortex during sleep deprivation.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2006.01.010	Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) has revealed biochemical alterations in various psychiatric disorders. Changes in brain metabolites may be caused not only by the disease's progression or response to treatment, but also by physiological variability. The aim of this study was to use (1)H MRS to assess the effects of specific short-term physiological states on major metabolites. Eight healthy women underwent (1)H MRS at the beginning and end of a 40-h period of sleep deprivation. The ratios of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), total creatine (tCr), and choline-containing compounds (Cho) to water (H(2)O) were determined from the occipital cortex during both baseline and photic stimulation conditions. During sleep deprivation, NAA/H(2)O decreased by 7% and Cho/H(2)O by 12%. Photic stimulation had no effect on the measured metabolites in the alert state, but in the sleep-deprived state the level of Cho/H(2)O increased during neuronal activation. The results suggest that NAA/H(2)O and Cho/H(2)O may depend on the state of alertness.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging of the thalamus in idiopathic generalized epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awg249	Experimental work in animal models of generalized epilepsy and clinical data in humans with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) indicate that the thalamo-cortical circuitry is involved in the generation of epileptic activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the chemical and structural integrity of the thalamus in patients with IGE. Thalamic proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI), measuring N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds and creatine (Cr) was performed in 20 IGE patients and in a group of age-matched healthy subjects. Additionally, 1H-MRSI measurements were taken in the insular cortex, the posterior temporal lobe white matter and the splenium of the corpus callosum. MRI volumetric analysis of the thalamus was performed in all patients. At the time of the examination, seizures were well controlled in 10 IGE patients and poorly controlled in nine. One patient was newly diagnosed and had the MRI and MRSI examination prior to starting the antiepileptic medication. In IGE patients, 1H-MRSI showed a reduction of mean thalamic NAA/Cr compared with normal controls; no difference was found in NAA/Cr in the other examined areas. There was no difference in NAA/Cr between patients whose seizures were well controlled and those in whom seizures were not controlled. There was no correlation between thalamic NAA/Cr and mean number of spike and wave complexes. We found a significant negative correlation between thalamic NAA/Cr and duration of epilepsy. The mean thalamic volume in patients with IGE was not different from normal controls. These results show evidence of progressive thalamic neuronal dysfunction in patients with IGE supporting the notion of abnormal thalamo-cortical circuitry as a substrate of seizure generation in this form of epilepsy. The thalamic dysfunction may occur regardless of amount of spike and wave activity.

Lateralisation with magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in temporal lobe epilepsy: an evaluation of visual and region-of-interest analysis of metabolite concentration images.	DOI: 10.1007/s002340100560	We carried out spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) on nine consecutive patients with temporal lobe epilepsy being assessed for epilepsy surgery, and nine neurologically healthy, age-matched volunteers. A volume of interest (VOI) was angled along the temporal horns on axial and sagittal images, and symmetrically over the temporal lobes on coronal images. Images showing the concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and of choline-containing compounds plus creatine and phosphocreatine (Cho + Cr) were used for lateralisation. We compared assessment by visual inspection and by signal analysis from regions of interest (ROI) in different positions, where side-to-side differences in NAA/(Cho + Cr) ratio were used for lateralisation. The NAA/ (Cho + Cr) ratio from the different ROI was also compared with that in the brain stem to assess if the latter could be used as an internal reference, e. g., for identification of bilateral changes. The metabolite concentration images were found useful for lateralisation of temporal lobe abnormalities related to epilepsy. Visual analysis can, with high accuracy, be used routinely.

Seizure frequency and bilateral temporal abnormalities: a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of temporal lobe epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1053/seiz.2000.0396	Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) was performed in seven healthy volunteers and 17 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to clarify the correlation of the severity of epilepsy with bilateral temporal changes in N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds (Cho) and creatine + phosphocreatine (Cr). Despite unilateral EEG focus, bilateral temporal reduction in NAA /(Cho + Cr) was revealed in patients with intractable seizures. The potential for seizure generation correlated with the NAA /(Cho + Cr) reduction not only on the ipsilateral side but also on the contralateral side. Proton MRS proved to be a useful measurement for obtaining important information about the neuronal changes as well as the lateralization of the epileptogenic focus in TLE patients.

Applications of neural network analyses to in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy of epilepsy patients.	DOI: 10.1016/s0920-1211(99)00019-4	A total of 67 in vivo water-suppressed proton magnetic resonance spectra of the temporal lobes were recorded from 15 patients with long standing temporal lobe epilepsy and 13 healthy volunteers. Conventional data analysis indicated slightly lower N-acetyl aspartate levels in epileptic patients compared with controls. For further analysis of data, a spectral region (4.0-1.5 ppm) was used as input for artificial neural network analysis. Correct classification of spectra was obtained in 66 out of 67 cases, disregarding from which side of the brain the spectra were recorded. The ability of the trained network to recognize spectra recorded both contalaterally and ipsilaterally to the epileptic focus strongly indicates bilateral metabolic changes. Artificial neural networks could also be trained to recognize whether the spectra were recorded from the ipsilateral or contralateral side of the epileptic focus, indicating that neural network analysis of in vivo proton MR spectra can be used as an additional tool for pre-surgical lateralization of seizure foci.

Proton MR spectroscopy in patients with complex partial seizures: single-voxel spectroscopy versus chemical-shift imaging.		Proton MR spectroscopy has recently been applied to the evaluation of seizures, but few comparisons have been made between different clinical spectroscopic techniques.

Quantitative 1H MRS in the evaluation of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in vivo.	DOI: 10.1016/s0730-725x(98)00123-4	Hippocampal metabolite concentrations were determined by localized in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) in eleven patients suffering from refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), as well as in eleven age-matched healthy volunteers, and compared with patient history, postoperative outcome and histopathology. Main results are: 1) In patients, the decrease in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations was highly significant ipsilateral, and less but still significant contralateral to the electroencephalogram-defined focus, as compared to controls. 2) The decrease in ipsilateral NAA measured preoperatively correlates with the degree of hippocampal sclerosis but 3) does not reliably predict postoperative outcome, although there is a trend toward better outcome in patients with a marked decrease of NAA. 4) Hippocampal NAA decrease (ipsi- and contralateral) is highly correlated with early onset age of epileptic seizures. 5) Among patients with similar onset age in early childhood, there is a strong association between duration of the disease and contralateral (and, though less clear-cut, ipsilateral) NAA loss. These results are concordant with the notion of a generally progressive worsening and complicating course of symptoms in poorly controlled MTLE.

Spectroscopic imaging of frontal neuronal dysfunction in hyperekplexia.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/121.8.1507	We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to assess in vivo cortical neuronal involvement in hyperekplexia. Cerebral neuronal function was measured using proton MRSI in four unrelated patients with hyperekplexia and 20 healthy controls. All patients had the major form of hyperekplexia, with additional atypical clinical features in two of them. Family history was positive in three patients and absent in one. The neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds (Cho) and creatine (Cr) were measured in frontal, central and parietal areas. The MRSI showed a reduction of the relative resonance intensity of NAA/(Cr + Cho) in frontal and central regions in three patients, and in the right frontal region of the fourth. In one patient a second MRSI showed normal relative NAA resonance intensities over both temporal lobes as well as in the brainstem. In two subjects the topography of EEG abnormalities in the frontal lobes coincided with the MRSI findings. This proton MRSI study indicates the presence of frontal neuronal dysfunction in hyperekplexia. Whether this represents cortical dysfunction or an epiphenomenon of diencephalic or brainstem abnormalities remains open. However, the observation of normal proton MRSI in the temporal regions and brainstem in one of the patients seems to concur with the hypothesis of a facilitatory role of cortical dysfunction within areas of sensorimotor representation in the generation of the pathological startle reaction in hyperekplexia.

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with complex partial seizures.		We prospectively studied eight patients with complex partial seizures, using single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Control data from 12 healthy volunteers were obtained with the same MRS protocol. The ratios between the peak areas of N-acetylaspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and choline-containing compounds (Cho) were analyzed. The results showed statistically significant lower N-acetylaspartate:Cr, N-acetylaspartate:Cho, and N-acetylaspartate: Cho + Cr ratios, and a higher Cho:Cr ratio in the mesial temporal lobes of the patient group than in healthy controls. Because N-acetylaspartate is located in the neurons and Cho and Cr in the glial cells, these observations represent the underlying neuronal loss and reactive astrocytosis in the epileptogenic foci. MRS can detect abnormal metabolic changes in most complex partial seizure patients with normal electroencephalography and magnetic resonance images. MRS can also identify bitemporal abnormalities which are a common feature in patients with complex partial seizures. Proton MRS could not confirm the specific location of seizure foci. Further investigation with quantitative spectral analysis and correlation with surgical outcome is needed to improve the contribution of MRS to the diagnosis and localization of seizure foci.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging of human temporal lobe epilepsy at 4.1 T.	DOI: 10.1002/ana.410380309	We performed proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) at high magnetic field (4.1 T) to study N-acetylaspartate, creatine, and choline levels in the brains of normal control subjects and patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. We compared the results of MRSI to those of other presurgical techniques to determine the sensitivity of this method in the lateralization of the epileptic focus. The normal hippocampal creatine-N-acetylaspartate ratio was 0.71 +/- 0.14 with no differences between left and right. Using the mean control hippocampal creatine-N-acetylaspartate ratio plus 2 standard deviations to identify statistically significant changes, we found lateralizing metabolic abnormalities corresponding to the operated temporal lobe in all patients. Four patients (40%) had contralateral abnormalities, and 2 of them had bilateral independent seizure onset confirmed by intracranial electroencephalographic studies. Statistically significant increases in the choline-N-acetylaspartate ratio in comparison to healthy volunteers were observed in 8 of the 10 patients. With the creatine-N-acetylaspartate ratio, MRSI demonstrated a 100% sensitivity compared to magnetic resonance imaging, which identified pathology in 70% of the patients. These findings suggest that proton MRSI yields a distinctive metabolic profile in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and is sensitive in detecting bilateral metabolic abnormalities in some patients. These preliminary findings suggest that MRSI is more sensitive than magnetic resonance imaging in the lateralization of epileptic foci in temporal lobe epilepsy.

Nine healthy volunteers were used as controls for in vivo MRS. NAA concentrations in vivo on the ipsilateral and contralateral sides were 6.5 +/- 1.3 (s.d.) and 7.9 (+/- 2.1) mmol l-1, respectively and 8.6 (+/- 0.8) mmol l-1 in the volunteers. NAA concentration in vitro was 3.2 (+/- 0.9) mumol g-1 wet weight (ww) and the corresponding concentration from the macroscopically intact brain tissue was 4.7 (+/- 1.0) mumol g-1 ww.

Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Finland: epidemiological, clinical, pathological and molecular genetic studies.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00143128	In 1974-1984 30 patients died with a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in Finland (annual mortality rate of CJD 0.9 per million population for the years 1979-1984). Six of these patients (20%) were familial, all belonging to the same kindred. The pedigree now includes 15 affected members in four generations, and the occurrence of disease is consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The clinical features of CJD in this family are in most respects typical of the familial disease described elsewhere. However, the mean age at onset is 47, periodic EEG activity has not been observed, and the mean duration of illness of 27.5 months is longer than usual for either familial or sporadic CJD. Neuropathological examination of brain biopsy and autopsy specimens revealed spongiform change without amyloid plaques, and brain tissue from one patient transmitted disease to a capuchin monkey. In an analysis of the histocompatibility antigens of the family, CJD was not linked with a single haplotype, but at least 12 out of 13 CJD patients shared the HLA antigen A28. Molecular genetic studies disclosed a new G-to-A mutation in codon 178 of the PRNP gene (resulting in a substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid) in the DNA of eight family members with CJD but not in any of ten currently healthy first degree relatives of the patients, or 86 controls. The codon 178 mutation thus seems to co-segregate with CJD in this family. Linkage analysis gave a LOD score value of 3.6.

The effects of tetrahydrocannabinol on the recognition of emotionally charged words: an analysis using event-related brain potentials.	DOI: 10.1159/000026487	The effects of synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were assessed in 19 healthy male volunteers while they performed a visual continuous word recognition task. The study used a double-blind cross-over design. Specifically, word lists were manipulated to contain an equal number of emotionally neutral, negative, and positive words. Most words were repeated after several intervening items with the subject's task to classify each word as old (previously seen) or new. Behaviorally, a decrease in recognition rate was observed under THC but no influence of the emotional charge of a word on recognition rate was seen. The ERPs showed a typical difference between old and new words taking the form of an enhanced positivity for old words beginning 250 ms poststimulus. The effects of THC were confined to the positive words, for which an enhancement of the positivity to the old words was seen. This effect was interpreted in terms of a congruity of the drug-induced mood state and the material to be recognized. The dissociation between ERPs and behavioral indices suggested that the former primarily reflect implicit memory processes.

Central nervous system effects of haloperidol on THC in healthy male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881109358200	In this study, the hypothesis that haloperidol would lead to an amelioration of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-induced 'psychotomimetic' effects was investigated. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial three-way crossover ascending dose study the effects of THC, haloperidol and their combination were investigated in 35 healthy, male mild cannabis users, measuring Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Visual Analogue Scales for alertness, mood, calmness and psychedelic effects, saccadic and smooth pursuit eye measurements, electroencephalography, Body Sway, Stroop test, Visual and Verbal Learning Task, hormone levels and pharmacokinetics. Compared with placebo, THC significantly decreased smooth pursuit, Visual Analogue Scales alertness, Stroop test performance, immediate and delayed word recall and prolactin concentrations, and significantly increased positive and general Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score, Visual Analogue Scales feeling high, Body Sway and electroencephalography alpha. Haloperidol reversed the THC-induced positive Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale increase to levels observed with haloperidol alone, but not THC-induced 'high' feelings. Compared with placebo, haloperidol significantly decreased saccadic peak velocity, smooth pursuit, Visual Analogue Scales mood and immediate and delayed word recall and significantly increased Body Sway, electroencephalography theta and prolactin levels. THC-induced increases in positive Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale but not in Visual Analogue Scales feeling high were reversed by haloperidol. This indicates that psychotic-like effects induced by THC are mediated by dopaminergic systems, but that other systems are involved in 'feeling high'. Additionally, the clear reductions of psychotic-like symptoms by a clinically relevant dose of haloperidol suggest that THC administration may be a useful pharmacological cannabinoid model for psychotic effects in healthy volunteers.

Topographic quantitative EEG sequelae of chronic marihuana use: a replication using medically and psychiatrically screened normal subjects.	DOI: 10.1016/s0376-8716(99)00029-0	In two previous studies it was reported that chronic marihuana (THC) use was associated with unique quantitative EEG features which were present in the non-intoxicated state. THC users, as contrasted with controls, had significant elevations of Absolute Power, Relative Power, and Coherence of alpha activity over the bilateral frontal cortex. Furthermore, a quantitative EEG discriminant function analyses permitted a 95% correct user versus non-user classification. However, because all of the THC users and 58% of the non-user controls were psychiatric inpatients, diagnostic and medication effects, if any, were uncontrolled. In the present study the same quantitative EEG methods were used to study daily THC users and non-user controls who underwent a rigorous screening process to insure that they were medically and psychiatrically healthy. The results of previous studies were replicated and an additional EEG correlate of chronic THC exposure (reduced alpha frequency) was identified.

Dose-related modulation of event-related potentials to novel and target stimuli by intravenous Δ⁹-THC in humans.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2012.8	Cannabinoids induce a host of perceptual alterations and cognitive deficits in humans. However, the neural correlates of these deficits have remained elusive. The current study examined the acute, dose-related effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC) on psychophysiological indices of information processing in humans. Healthy subjects (n=26) completed three test days during which they received intravenous Δ⁹-THC (placebo, 0.015 and 0.03 mg/kg) in a within-subject, double-blind, randomized, cross-over, and counterbalanced design. Psychophysiological data (electroencephalography) were collected before and after drug administration while subjects engaged in an event-related potential (ERP) task known to be a valid index of attention and cognition (a three-stimulus auditory 'oddball' P300 task). Δ⁹-THC dose-dependently reduced the amplitude of both the target P300b and the novelty P300a. Δ⁹-THC did not have any effect on the latency of either the P300a or P300b, or on early sensory-evoked ERP components preceding the P300 (the N100). Concomitantly, Δ⁹-THC induced psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, and subjective 'high' in a dose-dependent manner. Δ⁹-THC -induced reductions in P3b amplitude correlated with Δ⁹-THC-induced perceptual alterations. Lastly, exploratory analyses examining cannabis use status showed that whereas recent cannabis users had blunted behavioral effects to Δ(9)-THC, there were no dose-related effects of Δ⁹-THC on P300a/b amplitude between cannabis-free and recent cannabis users. Overall, these data suggest that at doses that produce behavioral and subjective effects consistent with the known properties of cannabis, Δ⁹-THC reduced P300a and P300b amplitudes without altering the latency of these ERPs. Cannabinoid agonists may therefore disrupt cortical processes responsible for context updating and the automatic orientation of attention, while leaving processing speed and earlier sensory ERP components intact. Collectively, the findings suggest that CB1R systems modulate top-down and bottom-up processing.

Disruption of frontal θ coherence by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol is associated with positive psychotic symptoms.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2010.222	The main ingredient in cannabis, Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can elicit acute psychotic reactions in healthy individuals and precipitate relapse in schizophrenic patients. However, the neural mechanism of this is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that THC psychopathology is related to changes in electroencephalography (EEG) power or inter-regional coherence. In a within-subjects design, participants (n=16) were given intravenous THC (1.25 mg) or placebo under double-blind conditions, during EEG recordings. Using fast-Fourier transform, EEG data were analyzed for power and coherence in the delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (3.5-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (14-25 Hz), low-gamma (30-40 Hz), and high-gamma (60-70 Hz) bands during engagement in the n-back test of working memory (WM). Compared with placebo, THC evoked positive and negative psychotic symptoms, as measured by the positive and negative syndrome scale (p<0.001) and slowed WM performance (p<0.05). Under THC, theta power was specifically reduced, (p<0.001) regardless of WM load; however, the reduction showed no relationship with psychotic symptoms or WM impairment. Coherence between bi-frontal electrodes in the theta band was also reduced by THC (p<0.05) and these reductions correlated with the change-in positive psychotic symptoms (rho=0.79, p<0.001). Bi-frontal specificity was suggested by the absence of a relationship between psychotic symptoms and fronto-parietal coherence. The results reveal that the pro-psychotic effects of THC might be related to impaired network dynamics with impaired communication between the right and left frontal lobes.

Effect of intrapulmonary tetrahydrocannabinol administration in humans.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881108089581	This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was designed to identify which pharmacodynamic parameters most accurately quantify the effects of delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the predominantly psychoactive component of cannabis. In addition, we investigated the acceptability and usefulness of a novel mode of intrapulmonary THC administration using a Volcano vaporizer and pure THC instead of cannabis. Rising doses of THC (2, 4, 6 and 8 mg) or vehicle were administered with 90 minutes intervals to twelve healthy males using a Volcano vaporizer. Very low between-subject variability was observed in THC plasma concentrations, characterising the Volcano vaporizer as a suitable method for the administration of THC. Heart rate showed a sharp increase and rapid decline after each THC administration (8 mg: 19.4 bpm: 95% CI 13.2, 25.5). By contrast, dose dependent effects of body sway (8 mg: 108.5%: 95% CI 72.2%, 152.4%) and different subjective parameters did not return to baseline between doses (Visual Analogue Scales of 'alertness' (8 mg: -33.6 mm: 95% CI -41.6, -25.7), 'feeling high' (8 mg: 1.09 U: 95% CI 0.85, 1.33), 'external perception' (8 mg: 0.62 U: 95% CI 0.37, 0.86)). PK/PD-modeling of heart rate displayed a relatively short equilibration half-life of 7.68 min. CNS parameters showed equilibration half-lives ranging between 39.4 - 84.2 min. Some EEG-frequency bands, and pupil size showed small changes following the highest dose of THC. No changes were seen in saccadic eye movements, smooth pursuit and adaptive tracking performance. These results may be applicable in the development of novel cannabinoid agonists and antagonists, and in studies of the pharmacology and physiology of cannabinoid systems in humans.

A follow-up study on features of sensory gating P50 in treatment-resistant depression patients.		Depressive disorder is a well-known chronic, recurrent and disabling mental disease with high direct and indirect costs to society in both western and eastern cultures. Approximately 40% of depressed patients show only partial or no response to initial or even multiple antidepressant medications and are usually called treatment-resistant depression (TRD) patients. The present work was to measure the features of sensory gating (SG) P50 in TRD patients with the intent of understanding the characteristics of this disease.

Changes in brain function during administration of venlafaxine or placebo to normal subjects.	DOI: 10.1177/155005940803900405	Previous research has demonstrated neurophysiologic effects of antidepressants in depressed subjects. We evaluated neurophysiologic effects of venlafaxine in normal subjects. Healthy adults (n=32) received a 1-week placebo lead-in followed by 4 weeks randomized double-blind treatment with venlafaxine IR 150 mg. (n = 17) or placebo (n = 15). Brain function was examined using quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) power and theta cordance. Normal subjects receiving venlafaxine showed a decrease in theta-band cordance in the midline-and-right-frontal (MRF) region at 48 hours and at 1 week after randomization. Decreases in relative power also were seen in the MRF region; there were no significant changes in absolute power. These changes were significantly different from those in subjects receiving placebo. Changes in MRF cordance accurately identified treatment condition at 48 hours in 81.3% of subjects, and relative power from this region identified 60.7% of subjects. In conclusion, cordance may detect the pharmacological effects of antidepressant medication in normal subjects. Future studies should examine other classes of medication, as well as antidepressants with other mechanisms of action, to determine if cordance detects antidepressant medication effects in general in normal subjects.

Resting-state quantitative electroencephalography reveals increased neurophysiologic connectivity in depression.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0032508	"Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are hypothesized to arise from dysfunction in brain networks linking the limbic system and cortical regions. Alterations in brain functional cortical connectivity in resting-state networks have been detected with functional imaging techniques, but neurophysiologic connectivity measures have not been systematically examined. We used weighted network analysis to examine resting state functional connectivity as measured by quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) coherence in 121 unmedicated subjects with MDD and 37 healthy controls. Subjects with MDD had significantly higher overall coherence as compared to controls in the delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-20 Hz) frequency bands. The frontopolar region contained the greatest number of ""hub nodes"" (surface recording locations) with high connectivity. MDD subjects expressed higher theta and alpha coherence primarily in longer distance connections between frontopolar and temporal or parietooccipital regions, and higher beta coherence primarily in connections within and between electrodes overlying the dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) or temporal regions. Nearest centroid analysis indicated that MDD subjects were best characterized by six alpha band connections primarily involving the prefrontal region. The present findings indicate a loss of selectivity in resting functional connectivity in MDD. The overall greater coherence observed in depressed subjects establishes a new context for the interpretation of previous studies showing differences in frontal alpha power and synchrony between subjects with MDD and normal controls. These results can inform the development of qEEG state and trait biomarkers for MDD."

Neurophysiologic effects of repeated exposure to antidepressant medication: are brain functional changes during antidepressant administration influenced by learning processes?	DOI: 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.09.016	Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a lifelong and recurrent illness, such that many individuals require multiple courses of antidepressant medication treatment. While some patients respond completely to each course of treatment, many do not, and with each unsuccessful antidepressant trial the likelihood that a patient will respond decreases. This raises the possibility that neurophysiologic response in subsequent antidepressant treatment may be influenced by learning processes including sensitization, habituation, and/or classical conditioning. Classical conditioning would entail the association of cues such as pill-taking (conditioned stimuli; CS) with the effects of active medication (unconditioned stimulus; US), such that later presentation of the CS alone would come to elicit a conditioned response (CR). Such effects could be revealed by blinded administration of placebo following a period of treatment with active medication. Habituation effects (tolerance), or sensitization effects (increased response), which require only repeated exposure to a stimulus, might be evidenced after repeated courses of antidepressant treatment. Knowledge of how learning processes impact neurophysiologic response to successive courses of antidepressant treatment would have relevance for clinical populations. Specific hypotheses, however, may be tested in healthy non-clinical samples to avoid potential confounding factors related to severity or chronicity of illness. Learning theories would suggest two hypotheses: (1) neurophysiologic response to placebo will differ between subjects who were previously treated with antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo (classical conditioning hypothesis); and (2) neurophysiologic response to an initial course of antidepressant treatment will differ from response to a repeated course of antidepressant treatment. Pilot data addressed these hypotheses in healthy never-depressed women who had previously received four weeks of venlafaxine IR, 150 mg (antidepressant-experienced subjects; n=2) or matching placebo (antidepressant-naive subjects; n=4) under double-blind conditions. Six-and-a-half years later, we treated these six women with placebo for one week, followed by four weeks of double-blind treatment with venlafaxine IR, 150 mg. Brain functional changes over the course of treatment were assessed using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to compare prefrontal neurophysiologic responses between subjects who had, versus had not, previously been exposed to venlafaxine. Antidepressant-experienced versus antidepressant-naive subjects showed greater decreases in prefrontal cordance (PFC) during venlafaxine administration (sensitization hypothesis) but did not show significantly different PFC changes during treatment with placebo in this small pilot sample (classical conditioning hypothesis). Data suggest that brief treatment with antidepressant medication may have an enduring impact on neurophysiologic responses to a subsequent course of antidepressant treatment. Hypotheses should be tested in larger samples.

Sleep-related changes in the human 'neuromuscular' ventilatory response to hypoxia.	DOI: 10.1016/s0034-5687(99)00064-x	The ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia are reduced during sleep compared to wakefulness. However, sleep-related increases in upper airways' resistance could reduce these ventilatory responses independently of any change in the neural output to the respiratory pump muscles. It is therefore possible that respiratory chemosensitivity, per se, is unchanged by sleep. To investigate this, four healthy male subjects were mechanically ventilated to abolish spontaneous respiratory muscle activity. The response to transient isocapnic hypoxia was quantified from the magnitude of the electromyographic activity induced in the diaphragm and from the associated reduction in peak inspiratory pressure; these indicies of respiratory motor output will not be affected by any sleep-related changes in upper airways' resistance. In all individuals, the responses to hypoxia were markedly attenuated during sleep compared to wakefulness. These observations, assessing the 'neuromuscular' ventilatory response, are consistent with a sleep-related reduction in respiratory chemosensitivity that is independent of any changes that may be due to increases in upper airways' resistance.

Analysing the behaviour change of brain regions of methamphetamine abusers using electroencephalogram signals: Hope to design a decision support system.	DOI: 10.1111/adb.13362	Long-term use of methamphetamine (meth) causes cognitive and neuropsychological impairments. Analysing the impact of this substance on the human brain can aid prevention and treatment efforts. In this study, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of meth abusers in the abstinence period and healthy subjects were recorded during eyes-closed and eyes-opened states to distinguish the brain regions that meth can significantly influence. In addition, a decision support system (DSS) was introduced as a complementary method to recognize substance users accompanied by biochemical tests. According to these goals, the recorded EEG signals were pre-processed and decomposed into frequency bands using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method. For each frequency band, energy, KS entropy, Higuchi and Katz fractal dimensions of signals were calculated. Then, statistical analysis was applied to select features whose channels contain a p-value less than 0.05. These features between two groups were compared, and the location of channels containing more features was specified as discriminative brain areas. Due to evaluating the performance of features and distinguishing the two groups in each frequency band, features were fed into a k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers. The results indicated that prolonged consumption of meth has a considerable impact on the brain areas responsible for working memory, motor function, attention, visual interpretation, and speech processing. Furthermore, the best classification accuracy, almost 95.8%, was attained in the gamma band during the eyes-closed state.

Clinical experience with the noninvasive ICP monitoring system.	DOI: 10.1007/3-211-32318-x_72	The Noninvasive ICP (Intracranial Pressure) Monitoring System NIP-200/210 has been used in several hospitals with more than 2000 patients since March 2002. It is based on the N2 wave response to flash visual evoked potentials (FVEP). According to our data, the mean latency period for the FVEP-induced N2 wave in healthy controls was 126.61 +/- 14.64 ms, in which that of females was shorter than that of males (123.95 +/- 10.345 ms vs. 130.75 +/- 14.632 ms; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the left or right side response (126.71 +/- 14.91 ms vs. 124.468 +/- 15.043 ms, p > 0.05). No significant difference in latency was found across age groups in our patient pool. In general, the N2 wave was stable and easily identified in most of the patients or healthy controls. When the data obtained with the NIP-200/210 Noninvasive ICP Monitoring System was compared with that from invasive techniques, the results were quite consistent (correlation index 0.651-0.97, standard error 8-15%). From our clinical trial results, we conclude that the latency periods for the FVEP-induced N2 wave reflected ICP values. However this technique is not suitable in patients with bifrontal hematoma, retinal concussion, or contusion of the optical nerve, because an FVEP value cannot be measured accurately in these cases. In our clinical trials, we used the FVEP technique to determine the effectiveness of mannitol in decreasing the ICP. The data revealed that ICP values decreased significantly within 20 minutes after a mannitol injection, and reached a minimum level at 40 minutes. For a single bolus of mannitol, the duration of the ICP decrease ranged from 30-210 minutes. Elevated ICP is one of the most important clinical issues in neurosurgery and neurology. The present noninvasive technique is safe and easy to perform, with a minimal risk of complications.

The Association Between Serum Vitamin D3 Levels and Autism Among Jordanian Boys.	DOI: 10.1007/s10803-019-04017-w	This study assesses the correlation between vitamin-D deficiency and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Jordan. We performed a case-controlled cross-sectional analysis to assess vitamin D levels in 83 children with ASD aged less than 8 years old compared to 106 healthy controls. In addition, the association between vitamin D deficiencies and gastrointestinal (GI) complains and electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities commonly found in children with ASD was investigated. Vitamin D levels in ASD patients were significantly lower. Also, Vitamin D levels in ASD patients had significant correlation with GI complains, but no correlation between vitamin D levels and Ca2+or EEG abnormalities was detected. These data suggest a possible role for vitamin D deficiency in the pathophysiology of ASD.

Analysis of KCNH2 and CACNA1C schizophrenia risk genes on EEG functional network modulation during an auditory odd-ball task.	DOI: 10.1007/s00406-018-0977-0	A deficit in task-related functional connectivity modulation from electroencephalogram (EEG) has been described in schizophrenia. The use of measures of neuronal connectivity as an intermediate phenotype may allow identifying genetic factors involved in these deficits, and therefore, establishing underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Genes involved in neuronal excitability and previously associated with the risk for schizophrenia may be adequate candidates in relation to functional connectivity alterations in schizophrenia. The objective was to study the association of two genes of voltage-gated ion channels (CACNA1C and KCNH2) with the functional modulation of the cortical networks measured with EEG and graph-theory parameter during a cognitive task, both in individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Both CACNA1C (rs1006737) and KCNH2 (rs3800779) were genotyped in 101 controls and 50 schizophrenia patients. Small-world index (SW) was calculated from EEG recorded during an odd-ball task in two different temporal windows (pre-stimulus and response). Modulation was defined as the difference in SW between both windows. Genetic, group and their interaction effects on SW in the pre-stimulus window and in modulation were evaluated using ANOVA. The CACNA1C genotype was not associated with SW properties. KCNH2 was significantly associated with SW modulation. Healthy subjects showed a positive SW modulation irrespective of the KCNH2 genotype, whereas within patients allele-related differences were observed. Patients carrying the KCNH2 risk allele (A) presented a negative SW modulation and non-carriers showed SW modulation similar to the healthy subjects. Our data suggest that KCNH2 genotype contributes to the efficient modulation of brain electrophysiological activity during a cognitive task in schizophrenia patients.

Transposable elements, placental development, and oocyte activation: Cellular stress and AMPK links jumping genes with the creation of human life.	DOI: 10.1016/j.mehy.2018.05.015	"Transposable elements (TEs), also known as ""jumping genes"", are DNA sequences first described by Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock that comprise nearly half of the human genome and are able to transpose or move from one genomic location to another. As McClintock also noted that a genome ""shock"" or stress may induce TE activation and transposition, accumulating evidence suggests that cellular stress (e.g. mediated by increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species [ROS] and calcium [Ca2+], etc.) induces TE mobilization in several model organisms and L1s (a member of the retrotransposon class of TEs) are active and capable of retrotransposition in human oocytes, human sperm, and in human neural progenitor cells. Cellular stress also plays a critical role in human placental development, with cytotrophoblast (CTB) differentiation leading to the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast (STB), a cellular layer that facilitates nutrient and gas exchange between the mother and the fetus. Syncytin-1, a protein that promotes fusion of CTB cells and is necessary for STB formation, and its receptor is found in human sperm and human oocytes, respectively, and increases in ROS and Ca2+ promote trophoblast differentiation and syncytin-1 expression. Cellular stress is also essential in promoting human oocyte maturation and activation which, similar to TE mobilization, can be induced by compounds that increase intracellular Ca2+ and ROS levels. AMPK is a master metabolic regulator activated by increases in ROS, Ca2+, and/or an AMP(ADP)/ATP ratio increase, etc. as well as compounds that induce L1 mobilization in human cells. AMPK knockdown inhibits trophoblast differentiation and AMPK-activating compounds that promote L1 mobility also enhance trophoblast differentiation. Cellular stressors that induce TE mobilization (e.g. heat shock) also promote oocyte maturation in an AMPK-dependent manner and the antibiotic ionomycin activates AMPK, promotes TE activation, and induces human oocyte activation, producing normal, healthy children. Metformin promotes AMPK-dependent telomerase activation (critical for telomere maintenance) and induces activation of the endonuclease RAG1 (promotes DNA cleavage and transposition) via AMPK. Both RAG1 and telomerase are derived from TEs. It is our hypothesis that cellular stress and AMPK links TE activation and transposition with placental development and oocyte activation, facilitating both human genome evolution and the creation of all human life. We also propose the novel observation that various cellular stress-inducing compounds (e.g. metformin, resveratrol, etc.) may facilitate beneficial TE activation and transposition and enhance fertilization and embryological development through a common mechanism of AMPK activation."

The Impact of Cortical Lesions on Thalamo-Cortical Network Dynamics after Acute Ischaemic Stroke: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005048	The neocortex and thalamus provide a core substrate for perception, cognition, and action, and are interconnected through different direct and indirect pathways that maintain specific dynamics associated with functional states including wakefulness and sleep. It has been shown that a lack of excitation, or enhanced subcortical inhibition, can disrupt this system and drive thalamic nuclei into an attractor state of low-frequency bursting and further entrainment of thalamo-cortical circuits, also called thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia (TCD). The question remains however whether similar TCD-like phenomena can arise with a cortical origin. For instance, in stroke, a cortical lesion could disrupt thalamo-cortical interactions through an attenuation of the excitatory drive onto the thalamus, creating an imbalance between excitation and inhibition that can lead to a state of TCD. Here we tested this hypothesis by comparing the resting-state EEG recordings of acute ischaemic stroke patients (N = 21) with those of healthy, age-matched control-subjects (N = 17). We observed that these patients displayed the hallmarks of TCD: a characteristic downward shift of dominant α-peaks in the EEG power spectra, together with increased power over the lower frequencies (δ and θ-range). Contrary to general observations in TCD, the patients also displayed a broad reduction in β-band activity. In order to explain the genesis of this stroke-induced TCD, we developed a biologically constrained model of a general thalamo-cortical module, allowing us to identify the specific cellular and network mechanisms involved. Our model showed that a lesion in the cortical component leads to sustained cell membrane hyperpolarization in the corresponding thalamic relay neurons, that in turn leads to the de-inactivation of voltage-gated T-type Ca2+-channels, switching neurons from tonic spiking to a pathological bursting regime. This thalamic bursting synchronises activity on a population level through divergent intrathalamic circuits, and entrains thalamo-cortical pathways by means of propagating low-frequency oscillations beyond the restricted region of the lesion. Hence, pathological stroke-induced thalamo-cortical dynamics can be the source of diaschisis, and account for the dissociation between lesion location and non-specific symptoms of stroke such as neuropathic pain and hemispatial neglect.

Vitamin D Deficiency in Children With Newly Diagnosed Idiopathic Epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1177/0883073814566627	Several studies have shown a link between vitamin D deficiency and epilepsy. This study includes 60 newly diagnosed idiopathic epilepsy patients and 101 healthy controls (between the ages of 5 and 16). Each group was also divided into two subgroups according to seasonal changes in terms of months of longer versus shorter daylight. We retrospectively evaluated the levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, and 25-OH vitamin-D3 in the study participants.

Calcium channel antibodies in patients with absence epilepsy.	DOI: 10.3109/00207454.2013.858337	Autoimmunity has aroused interest in the last years as a contributory mechanism of epilepsy, especially in epilepsies with unknown cause or therapy resistance. Since the relationship of absence epilepsy (AE) with calcium channels is well established, we aimed to investigate related antibodies in patients diagnosed with AE. Consecutive patients with typical absence seizures having either childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) or juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) with generalized spike and wave discharges on electroencephalography (EEG) were included after their consent. The patients were diagnosed according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2010 criteria. Antibodies against P-Q type voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) and T-type VGCC subunit Cav3.2 (encoded by the CACNA1H gene) were investigated by RIA and ELISA, respectively. We searched for these antibodies in 32 patients with AE and 53 patients with focal epilepsy of unknown cause (FEOUC) as the disease control group; furthermore, 30 healthy persons served as the healthy controls. Eleven patients (34.3%) with AE had CAE and the remaining patients had JAE. Only a 47-year-old female FEOUC patient, who also had systemic lupus erythematosus with normal MRI scans showed antibodies against P-Q type VGCC, whereas no antibody positivity could be found in other FEOUC and AE patients and healthy controls. Our results might suggest that calcium channel antibodies do not play an important role in the pathophysiology of AE. Further studies with larger groups of other epileptic syndromes are needed to confirm our results.

Failure to confirm association of a polymorphism in KCNMB4 gene with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2013.03.014	A recent study has implicated a tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs398702 located 3' of KCNMB4 (encoding calcium-activated potassium channel, subfamily M subunit beta 4) as a possible susceptibility allele for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). Such a finding warrants a further well-powered study in additional carefully phenotyped cohorts. Here we examined the role of the SNP (rs398702) in a cohort of 332 patients (182 women and 150 men; mean±SD age: 47.06±18.12) who had diagnoses of mTLE. None of the patients had a mass lesion, malformations of cortical development, or traumatic brain injury. Brain MRI study revealed hippocampal sclerosis (Hs) in 86/332 (26%) patients. Most patients (254/332, 76%) patients had drug-responsive mTLE. We also enrolled 335 healthy controls (164 women and 171 men; mean±SD age: 48.20±21.90), matched for age, sex and ethnicity. All patients and controls were Caucasian and were born in Italy. The genotype distribution of the SNP rs398702 in patients and controls was within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the genotype or allelic frequencies between patients and controls (p=0.878 and p=0.666 respectively). Moreover, such a variant did not influence the main clinical characteristics of mTLE, the presence of Hs or responsiveness to antiepileptic drugs. In conclusion, our data suggest that the rs398702 variant in the KCNMB4 gene is unlikely to influence significantly the risk of developing mTLE or its severity. They further highlight the importance of replication to confirm the validity of association study results.

Cortical activity evoked by an acute painful tissue-damaging stimulus in healthy adult volunteers.	DOI: 10.1152/jn.00990.2012	Everyday painful experiences are usually single events accompanied by tissue damage, and yet most experimental studies of cutaneous nociceptive processing in the brain use repeated laser, thermal, or electrical stimulations that do not damage the skin. In this study the nociceptive activity in the brain evoked by tissue-damaging skin lance was analyzed with electroencephalography (EEG) in 20 healthy adult volunteers (13 men and 7 women) aged 21-40 yr. Time-frequency analysis of the evoked activity revealed a distinct late event-related vertex potential (lance event-related potential, LERP) at 100-300 ms consisting of a phase-locked energy increase between 1 and 20 Hz (delta-beta bands). A pairwise comparison between lance and sham control stimulation also revealed a period of ultralate stronger desynchronization after lance in the delta band (1-5 Hz). Skin application of mustard oil before lancing, which sensitizes a subpopulation of nociceptors expressing the cation channel TRPA1, did not affect the ultralate desynchronization but reduced the phase-locked energy increase in delta and beta bands, suggesting a central interaction between different modalities of nociceptive inputs. Verbal descriptor screening of individual pain experience revealed that lance pain is predominantly due to Aδ fiber activation, but when individuals describe lances as C fiber mediated, an ultralate delta band event-related desynchronization occurs in the brain-evoked activity. We conclude that pain evoked by acute tissue damage is associated with distinct Aδ and C fiber-mediated patterns of synchronization and desynchronization of EEG oscillations in the brain.

CACNA1A variants may modify the epileptic phenotype of Dravet syndrome.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nbd.2012.10.016	Dravet syndrome is an intractable epileptic syndrome beginning in the first year of life. De novo mutations of SCN1A, which encode the Na(v)1.1 neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel, are considered the major cause of Dravet syndrome. In this study, we investigated genetic modifiers of this syndrome. We performed a mutational analysis of all coding exons of CACNA1A in 48 subjects with Dravet syndrome. To assess the effects of CACNA1A variants on the epileptic phenotypes of Dravet syndrome, we compared clinical features in two genotype groups: 1) subjects harboring SCN1A mutations but no CACNA1A variants (n=20) and 2) subjects with SCN1A mutations plus CACNA1A variants (n=20). CACNA1A variants detected in patients were studied using heterologous expression of recombinant human Ca(v)2.1 in HEK 293 cells and whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Nine CACNA1A variants, including six novel ones, were detected in 21 of the 48 subjects (43.8%). Based on the incidence of variants in healthy controls, most of the variants seemed to be common polymorphisms. However, the subjects harboring SCN1A mutations and CACNA1A variants had absence seizures more frequently than the patients with only SCN1A mutations (8/20 vs. 0/20, p=0.002). Moreover, the former group of subjects exhibited earlier onset of seizures and more frequent prolonged seizures before one year of age, compared to the latter group of subjects. The electrophysiological properties of four of the five novel Ca(v)2.1 variants exhibited biophysical changes consistent with gain-of-function. We conclude that CACNA1A variants in some persons with Dravet syndrome may modify the epileptic phenotypes.

A neural network model of sensitization of evoked cortical responses in migraine.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1468-2982.2002.00309.x	Migraine patients show abnormalities of cerebral electrophysiology that manifest themselves mainly during the attack interval. Cortical-evoked potentials of migraineurs fail to habituate to repetitive presentations of visual stimuli, and the amplitude of components of their auditory cortical-evoked potentials have a higher dependence on the stimulus intensities than in healthy subjects. A computer model of a neural hetwork has been developed that is able to reproduce both these neurophysiological dysfunctions. It predicts a positive correlation between the magnitudes of both these dysfunctions. The model also offers an explanation of why mutations in the same ion channel gene with opposite consequences on channel function, e.g. P/Q Ca2+ channels in migraine, may lead to similar electrophysiological abnormalities.

Febrile convulsions, ataxia, developmental delay, and obesity: a new syndrome?	DOI: 10.1177/088307380101600304	We describe the association of recurrent complicated febrile convulsions, developmental delay, ataxia, and obesity in three unrelated girls. The three girls, aged 3 to 4 years, were all born to healthy, nonconsanguineous parents and have normal siblings. Their birth weight was appropriate for gestational age. They are not dysmorphic and have normal head circumference. Development is delayed; they all walked with an ataxic gait after the age of 2 years and started speaking at 3 years. Their growth charts are remarkably alike: they initially had a normal growth curve and around 24 months of age started to gain weight excessively. They all continue to suffer from complicated febrile seizures, which started before 12 months of age, and are resistant to prophylactic anticonvulsants. Metabolic evaluation is normal. They have normal magnetic resonance images and electroencephalograms. Fragile X and Prader-Willi syndromes were ruled out. We suggest that this is a new mental retardation syndrome that should be considered in children with recurrent febrile convulsions, developmental delay, and obesity. In a recent study, mutations in the beta4 calcium channel were identified in the mutant epileptic mouse that presents with epilepsy, mental retardation, and ataxia. We hypothesize that a calcium channel gene may be involved in this syndrome.

Rapid recovery (20 ms) of human 600 Hz electroencephalographic wavelets after double stimulation of sensory nerves.	DOI: 10.1016/s0304-3940(00)01086-7	Non-invasive scalp-recordings of human somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) contain high-frequency (600 Hz) wavelet bursts, presumably generated by synchronized thalamocortical and/or intracortical population spikes. Here, double pulse stimulation (interval 20 ms) in 12 healthy subjects revealed significantly different burst recovery for mixed vs. sensory-only nerves. For median nerves the second burst response was decreased (11/11 subjects), possibly due to interfering reafferent (e.g. muscle spindle) input. In contrast, for sensory-only superficial radial nerves (containing less fibers than median nerves), weak bursts were detected in 6/11 subjects and were found fully recovered in 4/6 subjects. This potential for rapid burst recovery at 20 ms intervals renders contributions from neurons emitting bursts based on slowly recovering low-threshold calcium spikes unlikely and favors the generation of macroscopic SEP bursts by specialized cell populations, e.g. inhibitory interneurons and/or chattering cells the latter of which are capable to discharge rapidly repeating (50 Hz) high-frequency (600 Hz) bursts of fast sodium spikes.

On the cerebro-protective effects of caroverine, a calcium-channel blocker and antiglutamatergic drug: double-blind, placebo-controlled, EEG mapping and psychometric studies under hypoxia.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1996.tb00165.x	1. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the acute antihypoxidotic properties of the calcium-channel blocking and antiglutamatergic caroverine were investigated utilizing blood gas analysis, EEG mapping and psychometry under a transient, reversible, hypoxic hypoxidosis. 2. The latter was induced by a fixed gas combination of 9.8% oxygen (O2) and 90.2% nitrogen (N2) (found in 6000 m altitude), which was inhaled for 23 min under normobaric conditions by 16 healthy, young volunteers. They received randomized after an adaptation session, single oral doses of placebo, 40, 80 and 120 mg caroverine. Evaluation of blood gases, EEG mapping and psychometry were carried out 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post-drug, during hypoxia. 3. Blood gas analysis demonstrated a drop in PO2 from 95 to 33 and 30 mmHg, in PCO2 from 38 to 30 and 30 mmHg in the 14th and 23rd minute of inhalation, respectively, while pH increased from 7.41 to 7.50 and 7.51. Base excess and standard bicarbonate remained stable. 4. EEG mapping under hypoxia exhibited a marked increase of delta/theta, decrease of alpha and an increase of superimposed beta activity, which reflects deterioration of vigilance. 5. Caroverine attenuated this hypoxia-induced vigilance decrement in a dose- and time-dependent manner 6-8 h after 80 mg and 2-8 h after 120 mg. 6. Hypoxic hypoxidosis induced a deterioration of memory and attention variability, which was mitigated by 80 and 120 mg caroverine. However, there was an augmentation of the hypoxia-induced decrement in psychomotor performance after 120 mg. 7. The drug was well tolerated, and there were no significant differences compared with placebo with regard to pulse and blood pressure.

Inherited prion disease with 4-octapeptide repeat insertion: disease requires the interaction of multiple genetic risk factors.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awr079	Genetic factors are implicated in the aetiology of sporadic late-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Whether these genetic variants are predominantly common or rare, and how multiple genetic factors interact with each other to cause disease is poorly understood. Inherited prion diseases are highly heterogeneous and may be clinically mistaken for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease because of a negative family history. Here we report our investigation of patients from the UK with four extra octapeptide repeats, which suggest that the risk of clinical disease is increased by a combination of the mutation and a susceptibility haplotype on the wild-type chromosome. The predominant clinical syndrome is a progressive cortical dementia with pyramidal signs, myoclonus and cerebellar abnormalities that closely resemble sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Autopsy shows perpendicular deposits of prion protein in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Identity testing, PRNP microsatellite haplotyping and genealogical work confirm no cryptic close family relationships and suggests multiple progenitor disease haplotypes. All patients were homozygous for methionine at polymorphic codon 129. In addition, at a single nucleotide polymorphism upstream of PRNP thought to confer susceptibility to sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (rs1029273), all patients were homozygous for the risk allele (combined P=5.9×10(-5)). The haplotype identified may also be a risk factor in other partially penetrant inherited prion diseases although it does not modify age of onset. Blood expression of PRNP in healthy individuals was modestly higher in carriers of the risk haplotype. These findings may provide a precedent for understanding apparently sporadic neurodegenerative diseases caused by rare high-risk mutations.

Dose-dependent effects of endotoxin on human sleep.	DOI: 10.1152/ajpregu.2000.278.4.R947	The role of the central nervous system in the host response to infection and inflammation and modulation of these responses by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system are well established. In animals, activation of host defense mechanisms increases non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep amount and intensity, which, in turn, are thought to support host defense, or the body's ability to defend itself against challenges to its immune system. In humans, the evidence is conflicting. Therefore, we investigated the effects of three placebo-controlled doses of endotoxin on host response, including nocturnal sleep in healthy volunteers. Administered before nocturnal sleep onset, endotoxin dose dependently increased rectal temperature, heart rate, and the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble TNF receptors, interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, and cortisol. The lowest dose reliably increased circulating levels of cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors, but it did not affect rectal temperature, heart rate, or cortisol. This subtle host defense activation increased deep NREM sleep amount, often referred to as slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4), and intensity (delta power). Conversely, the highest dose of endotoxin disrupted sleep. Whereas it is well established that the endocrine and thermoregulatory systems are very sensitive to endotoxin, this study shows that human sleep-wake behavior is even more sensitive to activation of host defense mechanisms.

Graph Analysis of TMS-EEG Connectivity Reveals Hemispheric Differences following Occipital Stimulation.	DOI: 10.3390/s23218833	(1) Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) provides a unique opportunity to investigate brain connectivity. However, possible hemispheric asymmetries in signal propagation dynamics following occipital TMS have not been investigated. (2) Methods: Eighteen healthy participants underwent occipital single-pulse TMS at two different EEG sites, corresponding to early visual areas. We used a state-of-the-art Bayesian estimation approach to accurately estimate TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) from EEG data, which has not been previously used in this context. To capture the rapid dynamics of information flow patterns, we implemented a self-tuning optimized Kalman (STOK) filter in conjunction with the information partial directed coherence (iPDC) measure, enabling us to derive time-varying connectivity matrices. Subsequently, graph analysis was conducted to assess key network properties, providing insight into the overall network organization of the brain network. (3) Results: Our findings revealed distinct lateralized effects on effective brain connectivity and graph networks after TMS stimulation, with left stimulation facilitating enhanced communication between contralateral frontal regions and right stimulation promoting increased intra-hemispheric ipsilateral connectivity, as evidenced by statistical test (p < 0.001). (4) Conclusions: The identified hemispheric differences in terms of connectivity provide novel insights into brain networks involved in visual information processing, revealing the hemispheric specificity of neural responses to occipital stimulation.

Connectivity modulations induced by reach&grasp movements: a multidimensional approach.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-021-02458-x	Reach&grasp requires highly coordinated activation of different brain areas. We investigated whether reach&grasp kinematics is associated to EEG-based networks changes. We enrolled 10 healthy subjects. We analyzed the reach&grasp kinematics of 15 reach&grasp movements performed with each upper limb. Simultaneously, we obtained a 64-channel EEG, synchronized with the reach&grasp movement time points. We elaborated EEG signals with EEGLAB 12 in order to obtain event related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) and lagged linear coherence between Brodmann areas. Finally, we evaluated network topology via sLORETA software, measuring network local and global efficiency (clustering and path length) and the overall balance (small-worldness). We observed a widespread ERD in α and β bands during reach&grasp, especially in the centro-parietal regions of the hemisphere contralateral to the movement. Regarding functional connectivity, we observed an α lagged linear coherence reduction among Brodmann areas contralateral to the arm involved in the reach&grasp movement. Interestingly, left arm movement determined widespread changes of α lagged linear coherence, specifically among right occipital regions, insular cortex and somatosensory cortex, while the right arm movement exerted a restricted contralateral sensory-motor cortex modulation. Finally, no change between rest and movement was found for clustering, path length and small-worldness. Through a synchronized acquisition, we explored the cortical correlates of the reach&grasp movement. Despite EEG perturbations, suggesting that the non-dominant reach&grasp network has a complex architecture probably linked to the necessity of a higher visual control, the pivotal topological measures of network local and global efficiency remained unaffected.

Single doses of piracetam affect 42-channel event-related potential microstate maps in a cognitive paradigm.	DOI: 10.1159/000119026	We examined whether a single administration of piracetam produces dose-dependent effects on brain functions in healthy young men. In 6 subjects, 42-channel event-related EEG potential maps (ERP) were recorded during a task requiring subjects to watch single digits presented in a pseudorandom order on a screen and to press a button after all triplets of three consecutive odd or even digits. The ERP maps to the three digits of the correctly detected triplets were analyzed in terms of their mapped ERP field configuration (landscape). Different landscapes of the maps indicate different configuration of the activated neural population and therefore reflect different functional microstates of the brain. In order to identify these microstates, adaptive segmentation of the map series based on their landscapes was done. Nineteen time segments were found. These segments were tested for direct effects on brain function of three single doses of piracetam (2.9, 4.8 or 9.6 g) and a placebo given double-blind in balanced order. Piracetam mainly affected the map landscape of the time segments following the triplet's last digit. U-shaped dose-dependent effects were found; they were strongest after 4.8 g piracetam. Since these particular ERP segments are recognized to be strongly correlated to cognitive functions, the present findings suggest that single medium doses of piracetam selectively activate differently located or oriented neurons during cognitive steps of information processing.

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, pharmacokinetic and -dynamic studies with 2 new formulations of piracetam (infusion and sirup) under hypoxia in man.		In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 12 g piracetam in 2 different formulations were investigated utilizing blood gas analysis, EEG mapping and psychometry under a transient, reversible, hypoxic hypoxidosis. The latter was induced by a fixed gas combination of 9.8% oxygen (O2) and 90.2% nitrogen (N2, found in 6,000 m altitude), which was inhaled for 23 minutes under normobraic conditions by 18 healthy volunteers. They received after an adaptation session randomized at weekly intervals 12 g piracetam i.v. (250 ml infusion over 30 minutes), 12 g piracetam p.o. (60 ml sirup) and placebo. Blood levels were determined by means of an HPLC at the hours 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24. The 2 formulations showed a very similar time-course, with slightly higher blood levels in the 1st hour after the intravenous than oral administration, and vice versa thereafter. The elimination half-life was 4.3 hours for both formulations, the area under the curve and the clearance value were also almost identical. Evaluation of blood gases, EEG mapping and psychometry were carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours post-drug. Blood gas analysis demonstrated a drop in SaO2 from 99 to 73 and 70%, in PO2 from 100 to 35 and 33 mmHg, in PCO2 from 36 to 31 and 31 mmHg in the 14th and 23rd minute of inhalation, respectively. pH increased from 7.43 to 7.48 in the respective minutes, while base excess and standard bicarbonate remained stable. EEG mapping exhibited under hypoxia a marked increase of total power, mostly due to an augmentation of delta/theta, and a decrease of alpha activity, which reflects deterioration of vigilance. Both piracetam preparations significantly attenuated this vigilance decrement, with 12 g piracetam i.v. showing its encephalotropic peak effects in the earlier hours, 12 g piracetam sirup in the later hours. At the behavioral level, hypoxic hypoxidosis induced a deterioration of the noo- and thymopsyche, which was mitigated by both piracetam preparations, mostly in the 6th hour. Both formulations were well tolerated.

Single-dose piracetam effects on global complexity measures of human spontaneous multichannel EEG.	DOI: 10.1016/s0167-8760(99)00044-6	Global complexity of 47-channel resting electroencephalogram (EEG) of healthy young volunteers was studied after intake of a single dose of a nootropic drug (piracetam, Nootropil UCB Pharma) in 12 healthy volunteers. Four treatment levels were used: 2.4, 4.8, 9.6 g piracetam and placebo. Brain electric activity was assessed through Global Dimensional Complexity and Global Omega-Complexity as quantitative measures of the complexity of the trajectory of multichannel EEG in state space. After oral ingestion (1-1.5 h), both measures showed significant decreases from placebo to 2.4 g piracetam. In addition, Global Dimensional Complexity showed a significant return to placebo values at 9.6 g piracetam. The results indicate that a single dose of piracetam dose-dependently affects the spontaneous EEG in normal volunteers, showing effects at the lowest treatment level. The decreased EEG complexity is interpreted as increased cooperativity of brain functional processes.

Mismatch negativity as EEG biomarker supporting CNS drug development: a transnosographic and translational study.	DOI: 10.1038/s41398-021-01371-1	The lack of translation from basic research into new medicines is a major challenge in CNS drug development. The need to use novel approaches relying on (i) patient clustering based on neurobiology irrespective to symptomatology and (ii) quantitative biomarkers focusing on evolutionarily preserved neurobiological systems allowing back-translation from clinical to nonclinical research has been highlighted. Here we sought to evaluate the mismatch negativity (MMN) response in schizophrenic (SZ) patients, Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and age-matched healthy controls. To evaluate back-translation of the MMN response, we developed EEG-based procedures allowing the measurement of MMN-like responses in a rat model of schizophrenia and a mouse model of AD. Our results indicate a significant MMN attenuation in SZ but not in AD patients. Consistently with the clinical findings, we observed a significant attenuation of deviance detection (~104.7%) in rats subchronically exposed to phencyclidine, while no change was observed in APP/PS1 transgenic mice when compared to wild type. This study provides new insight into the cross-disease evaluation of the MMN response. Our findings suggest further investigations to support the identification of neurobehavioral subtypes that may help patients clustering for precision medicine intervention. Furthermore, we provide evidence that MMN could be used as a quantitative/objective efficacy biomarker during both preclinical and clinical stages of SZ drug development.

Left auditory cortex gamma synchronization and auditory hallucination symptoms in schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1186/1471-2202-10-85	Oscillatory electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities may reflect neural circuit dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders. Previously we have found positive correlations between the phase synchronization of beta and gamma oscillations and hallucination symptoms in schizophrenia patients. These findings suggest that the propensity for hallucinations is associated with an increased tendency for neural circuits in sensory cortex to enter states of oscillatory synchrony. Here we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) generated in the left primary auditory cortex is positively correlated with auditory hallucination symptoms in schizophrenia. We also examined whether the 40 Hz ASSR deficit in schizophrenia was associated with cross-frequency interactions. Sixteen healthy control subjects (HC) and 18 chronic schizophrenia patients (SZ) listened to 40 Hz binaural click trains. The EEG was recorded from 60 electrodes and average-referenced offline. A 5-dipole model was fit from the HC grand average ASSR, with 2 pairs of superior temporal dipoles and a deep midline dipole. Time-frequency decomposition was performed on the scalp EEG and source data.

Dual-Targeted Autoimmune Sword in Fatal Epilepsy: Patient's glutamate receptor AMPA GluR3B peptide autoimmune antibodies bind, induce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in, and kill both human neural cells and T cells.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102462	Nodding Syndrome (NS) is a fatal pediatric epilepsy of unknown etiology, accompanied by multiple neurological impairments, and associated with Onchocerca volvulus (Ov), malnutrition, war-induced trauma, and other insults. NS patients have neuroinflammation, and ~50% have cross-reactive Ov/Leiomodin-1 neurotoxic autoimmune antibodies. RESULTS: Studying 30 South Sudanese NS patients and a similar number of healthy subjects from the same geographical region, revealed autoimmune antibodies to 3 extracellular peptides of ionotropic glutamate receptors in NS patients: AMPA-GluR3B peptide antibodies (86%), NMDA-NR1 peptide antibodies (77%) and NMDA-NR2 peptide antibodies (87%) (in either 1:10, 1:100 or 1:1000 serum dilution). In contrast, NS patients did not have 26 other well-known autoantibodies that target the nervous system in several autoimmune-mediated neurological diseases. We demonstrated high expression of both AMPA-GluR3 and NMDA-NR1 in human neural cells, and also in normal human CD3+ T cells of both helper CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ types. Patient's GluR3B peptide antibodies were affinity-purified, and by themselves precipitated short 70 kDa neuronal GluR3. NS patient's affinity-purified GluR3B peptide antibodies also bound to, induced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in, and killed both human neural cells and T cells within 1-2 hours only. NS patient's purified IgGs, or serum (1:10 or 1:30), induced similar effects. In vivo video EEG experiments in normal mice, revealed that when NS patient's purified IgGs were released continuously (24/7 for 1 week) in normal mouse brain, they induced all the following: 1.Seizures, 2. Cerebellar Purkinje cell loss, 3. Degeneration in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and 4. Elevation of CD3+ T cells, and of activated Mac-2+microglia and GFAP+astrocytes in both the gray and white matter of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, corpus calossum and cerebellum of mice. NS patient's serum cytokines: IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, IFNγ, are reduced by 85-99% compared to healthy subjects, suggesting severe immunodeficiency in NS patients. This suspected immunodeficiency could be caused by combined effects of the: 1. Chronic Ov infection, 2. Malnutrition, 3. Killing of NS patient's T cells by patient's own GluR3B peptide autoimmune antibodies (alike the killing of normal human T cells by the NS patient's GluR3B peptide antibodies found herein in vitro). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of NS etiology, NS patients suffer from 'Dual-targeted Autoimmune Sword': autoimmune AMPA GluR3B peptide antibodies that bind, induce ROS in, and kill both neural cells and T cells. These neurotoxic and immunotoxic GluR3B peptide autoimmune antibodies, and also NS patient's NMDA-NR1/NR2A and Ov/Leiomodin-1 autoimmune antibodies, must be silenced or removed. Moreover, the findings of this study are relevant not only to NS, but also to many more patients with other types of epilepsy, which have GluR3B peptide antibodies in serum and/or CSF. This claim is based on the following facts: 1. The GluR3 subunit is expressed in neural cells in crucial brains regions, in motor neurons in the spinal cord, and also in other cells in the body, among them T cells of the immune system, 2. The GluR3 subunit has diverse neurophysiological role, and its deletion or abnormal function can: disrupt oscillatory networks of both sleep and breathing, impair motor coordination and exploratory activity, and increase the susceptibility to generate seizures, 3. GluR3B peptide antibodies were found so far in ~27% of >300 epilepsy patients worldwide, which suffer from various other types of severe, intractable and enigmatic epilepsy, and which turned out to be 'Autoimmune Epilepsy'. Furthermore, the findings of this study could be relevant to different neurological diseases besides epilepsy, since other neurotransmitter-receptors autoantibodies are present in other neurological and psychiatric diseases, e.g. autoimmune antibodies against other GluRs, Dopamine receptors, GABA receptors, Acetylcholine receptors and others. These neurotransmitter-receptors autoimmune autoantibodies might also act as 'Dual-targeted Autoimmune Sword' and damage both neural cells and T cells (as the AMPA-GluR3B peptide antibodies induced in the present study), since T cells, alike neural cells, express most if not all these neurotransmitter receptors, and respond functionally to the respective neurotransmitters - a scientific and clinical topic we coined 'Nerve-Driven Immunity'.

Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert attenuates early EEG components associated with defective sensory gating in patients with Alzheimer disease - a two-case study.	DOI: 10.1111/ejn.13749	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with deterioration of memory and cognitive function and a degeneration of neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). The NBM is the major input source of acetylcholine (ACh) to the cortex. The decreasing cholinergic innervation of the cortex due to degeneration of the NBM might be the cause of loss of memory function. NBM-Deep brain stimulation (NBM-DBS) is considered to serve as a potential therapeutic option for patients with AD by supporting residual cholinergic transmission to stabilize oscillatory activity in memory-relevant circuits. However, whether DBS could improve sensory memory functions in patients with AD is not clear. Here, in a passive auditory oddball paradigm, patients with AD (N = 2) listened to repetitive background tones (standard tones) randomly interrupted by frequency deviants in two blocks with NBM-DBS OFF and then NBM-DBS ON, while age-matched healthy controls (N = 6) repeated the experiment twice. The mismatch negativity in NBM-DBS OFF significantly differed from controls in both blocks, but not under NBM-DBS, which was likely due to a pronounced P50 increase overlapping with the N1 in NBM-DBS OFF. This early complex of EEG components recovered under stimulation to a normal level as defined by responses in controls. In this temporal interval, we found in patients with NBM-DBS ON (but not with NBM-DBS OFF) and in controls a strong repetition suppression effect to standard tones - with more attenuated responses to frequently repeated standard tones. This highlights the role of NBM-DBS for sensory gating of familiar auditory information into sensory memory.

Sleep spindles and rapid eye movement sleep as predictors of next morning cognitive performance in healthy middle-aged and older participants.	DOI: 10.1111/jsr.12108	Spindles and slow waves are hallmarks of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Both these oscillations are markers of neuronal plasticity, and play a role in memory and cognition. Normal ageing is associated with spindle and slow wave decline and cognitive changes. The present study aimed to assess whether spindle and slow wave characteristics during a baseline night predict cognitive performance in healthy older adults the next morning. Specifically, we examined performance on tasks measuring selective and sustained visual attention, declarative verbal memory, working memory and verbal fluency. Fifty-eight healthy middle-aged and older adults (aged 50-91 years) without sleep disorders underwent baseline polysomnographic sleep recording followed by neuropsychological assessment the next morning. Spindles and slow waves were detected automatically on artefact-free non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalogram. All-night stage N2 spindle density (no./min) and mean frequency (Hz) and all-night non-rapid eye movement sleep slow wave density (no./min) and mean slope (μV/s) were analysed. Pearson's correlations were performed between spindles, slow waves, polysomnography and cognitive performance. Higher spindle density predicted better performance on verbal learning, visual attention and verbal fluency, whereas spindle frequency and slow wave density or slope predicted fewer cognitive performance variables. In addition, rapid eye movement sleep duration was associated with better verbal learning potential. These results suggest that spindle density is a marker of cognitive functioning in older adults and may reflect neuroanatomic integrity. Rapid eye movement sleep may be a marker of age-related changes in acetylcholine transmission, which plays a role in new information encoding.

Evidence for gamma and beta sensory gating deficits as translational endophenotypes for schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2013.07.002	Thorough analysis of translational endophenotypes is needed to improve therapeutic development in schizophrenia. Abnormal sensory gating, one such endophenotype, is associated with reduced expression of the α7 nicotinic receptor. However, typical gating measures such as the P50 evoked response are often low-pass filtered, and it is unclear how α7 expression affects gating at higher frequencies. Therefore, this study used time-frequency analysis to compare sensory gating at the beta and gamma frequencies between human patients and healthy controls as well as between α7 heterozygote mutant mice and wild-type. Gating of total beta (15-26Hz) and gamma (30-50Hz) power during paired clicks was assessed from mouse in vivo hippocampal CA3 recordings. Gating was also assessed in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls using electroencephalography. Relative to wild-type, α7 heterozygote mice showed impaired gating of total beta and gamma power. Similarly, relative to controls, patients showed impaired gating of total beta and gamma power. Poor beta gating was associated with negative symptoms. These results demonstrate that schizophrenia patients and α7 heterozygote mice show similar deficits in gating high frequency power. Time-frequency analysis of beta and gamma gating may thus be a translational method of assessing the genetic basis of gating deficits in schizophrenia.

Some cases with LVEEG (approximately 1/3) have been linked to chromosome 20q13.2q13.3. In the same chromosomal region, the gene for the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit (CHRNA4) has been located. We therefore tested the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the CHRNA4 gene show an allelic association with panic disorder. We examined the allele frequencies of three different CHRNA4 polymorphisms in patients with panic disorder and in healthy controls. No significant differences in the allele frequencies of these three polymorphisms were noted. This study does not support an association between panic disorder and the CHRNA4 gene.

Overnight suppression of HPA axis after mineraolocorticoid receptor stimulation: A sleep endocrine study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psychres.2015.02.008	Nocturnal hyperactivity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) indicates decreased feedback inhibition with stress-related conditions such as major depression and sleep disorders. To characterize the role of mineralocorticoid (MR) in regulation of HPA axis activity during nocturnal sleep and involvement in sleep architecture, we investigated sleep endocrine effects of the MR agonist fludrocortisone in healthy men after pretreatment with metyrapone to minimize the impact of endogenous cortisol. Subjects (n=8) were treated on three occasions in a single-blinded design in random order with a) metyrapone, b) fludrocortisone after metyrapone, and c) placebo. Polysomnography was recorded and blood samples were drawn for determination of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol during the entire night. After metyrapone administration ACTH was significantly enhanced, while overall nocturnal cortisol secretion remained largely unchanged. Whereas administration of fludrocortisone induced a significant inhibitory effect on basal ACTH and cortisol secretion, no considerable effects on sleep pattern were detectable. While the involvement of MR in sleep regulation needs further study, endocrine findings underline the role of MR in tonic regulation of HPA axis during nocturnal sleep and demonstrate the ability of fludrocortisone to further suppress HPA axis activity overnight. Additional studies would be required to evaluate endocrine and clinical fludrocortisone effects in depressive patients showing HPA hyperactivity.

Equivalent current dipole sources of neurofeedback training-induced alpha activity through temporal/spectral analytic techniques.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0264415	"Much of the work in alpha NFT has focused on evaluating changes in alpha amplitude. However, the generation mechanism of training-induced alpha activity has not yet been clarified. The present study aimed to identify sources of training-induced alpha activity through four temporal/spectral analytic techniques, i.e., the max peak average (MPA), positive average (PA), negative average (NA) and event-related spectral perturbation average (ERSPA) methods. Thirty-five healthy participants were recruited into an alpha group receiving feedback of 8-12-Hz amplitudes, and twenty-eight healthy participants were recruited into a control group receiving feedback of random 4-Hz amplitudes from the range of 7 to 20 Hz. Twelve sessions were performed within 4 weeks (3 sessions per week). The control group had no change in the amplitude spectrum. In contrast, twenty-nine participants in the alpha group showed significant alpha amplitude increases exclusively and were identified as ""responders"". A whole-head EEG was recorded for the ""responders"" after NFT. The epochs of training-induced alpha activity from whole-head EEG were averaged by four different methods for equivalent current dipole source analysis. High agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficients on dipole source localization between each method were observed, showing that the dipole clusters of training-induced alpha activity were consistently located in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and middle temporal gyrus. The residual variance (goodness of fit) for dipole estimation of the MPA was significantly smaller than that of the others. Our findings indicate that the precuneus, PCC and middle temporal gyrus play important roles in enhancing training-induced alpha activity. The four averaging methods (especially the MPA method) were suitable for investigating sources of brainwaves.

Source-domain spectral EEG analysis of sports-related concussion via Measure Projection Analysis.	DOI: 10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319284	Here, we investigated EEG-based source-level spectral differences between adolescents with sports-related concussions and healthy age matched controls. We transformed resting state EEG collected in both groups to the source domain using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and computed the component process power spectra. For group-level analysis in the source domain, we used a probabilistic framework, Measure Projection Analysis (MPA), that has advantages over parametric k-means clustering of brain sources. MPA revealed that some frontal brain sources in the concussed group had significantly more power in the beta band (p<;0.005) and significantly less delta (p<;0.01) and theta band power (p<;0.05) than the healthy control group. These results suggest that a shift in spectral profile toward higher frequencies in some frontal brain regions might distinguish individuals with concussion from healthy controls.

Evaluation of spontaneous dense array gamma oscillatory activity and minor physical anomalies as a composite neurodevelopmental endophenotype in schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2014.11.002	Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) and gamma oscillatory activity have been proposed as associated endophenotypes in schizophrenia. Combining these endophenotypes to create a composite endophenotype may help identify those at risk for schizophrenia better. The present study aims to investigate MPAs and gamma oscillatory activity in schizophrenia patients, their unaffected first degree relatives and healthy controls and appreciate whether they can be used together as a composite endophenotype.

Increased spontaneous gamma power and synchrony in schizophrenia patients having higher minor physical anomalies.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psychres.2012.09.006	The higher frequency of minor physical anomalies (MPAs) in schizophrenia provides morphological evidence for the neurodevelopmental theory. Abnormal gamma oscillations (>30 Hz) seen in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in schizophrenia have been hypothesized to result from developmental insults. This study investigated spontaneous gamma oscillations in schizophrenia patients having higher and lower number of MPAs. Forty drug naïve/free schizophrenia patients and 20 matched healthy controls were assessed for MPAs on the Extended Waldrop Scale (EWS). All participants underwent an awake, resting 192-channel EEG recording. Spontaneous gamma spectral power and coherence were estimated in the low- (30-50 Hz) and high-gamma (51-70 and 71-100 Hz) bands. Significantly higher power was observed in high-MPA than healthy control group in low-gamma band over right frontal, parietal and temporal regions. Spectral power in the high-gamma band (71-100 Hz) was also significantly higher in the high-MPA schizophrenia subgroup than in the healthy control group over left frontal, parietal and temporal regions. Additionally, regional intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric coherence in the low-gamma band was significantly higher in the high-MPA schizophrenia subgroup than on the healthy control group. This study is the first to provide evidence of increased spontaneous gamma power and synchrony in schizophrenia patients having higher MPAs, supporting the idea that it may represent a distinct subgroup of schizophrenia with a neurodevelopmental basis.

Impeded frontal-occipital communications during Go/Nogo tasks in humans owing to mental workload.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bbr.2022.114182	Human brains rely on oscillatory coupling mechanisms for regulating access to prefrontal cognitive resources, dynamically communicating between the frontal and remote cortex. We worry that communications across cortical regions will be impeded when humans in extreme space environments travel with mental load work, affecting the successful completion of missions. Here, we monitored crews of workers performing a Go/Nogo task in space travel, accompanied by acquisitions of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. These data demonstrated that when the target stimulus suddenly changed to the non-target stimulus, an instantaneous communication mechanism between the frontal and occipital cortex was established by theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). However, this frontal-occipital communication was impeded because of the mental workload of space travel. 86 healthy volunteers who participated in the ground imitation further indicated that mental workload caused decoupled theta-gamma PAC during the Go/Nogo task, impeding frontal-occipital communications and behavioral performance. We also found that the degree of theta-gamma PAC coupling in space was significantly lower than on the ground, indicating that mental workload and other hazards worsen the impeded frontal-occipital communications of humans. These results could guide countermeasures for the inadaptability of humans working in spaceflight.

Electrophysiological correlates of thalamocortical function in acute severe traumatic brain injury.	DOI: 10.1016/j.cortex.2022.04.007	Tools assaying the neural networks that modulate consciousness may facilitate tracking of recovery after acute severe brain injury. The ABCD framework classifies resting-state EEG into categories reflecting levels of thalamocortical network function that correlate with outcome in post-cardiac arrest coma. In this longitudinal cohort study, we applied the ABCD framework to 20 patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury requiring intensive care (12 of whom were also studied at ≥6-months post-injury) and 16 healthy controls. We tested four hypotheses: 1) EEG ABCD classifications are spatially heterogeneous and temporally variable; 2) ABCD classifications improve longitudinally, commensurate with the degree of behavioral recovery; 3) ABCD classifications correlate with behavioral level of consciousness; and 4) the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised arousal facilitation protocol yields improved ABCD classifications. Channel-level EEG power spectra were classified based on spectral peaks within pre-defined frequency bands: 'A' = no peaks above delta (<4 Hz) range (complete thalamocortical disruption); 'B' = theta (4-8 Hz) peak (severe thalamocortical disruption); 'C' = theta and beta (13-24 Hz) peaks (moderate thalamocortical disruption); or 'D' = alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta peaks (normal thalamocortical function). Acutely, 95% of patients demonstrated 'D' signals in at least one channel but exhibited within-session temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity in the proportion of different channel-level ABCD classifications. By contrast, healthy participants and patients at follow-up consistently demonstrated signals corresponding to intact thalamocortical network function. Patients demonstrated longitudinal improvement in ABCD classifications (p < .05) and ABCD classification distinguished patients with and without command-following in the subacute-to-chronic phase of recovery (p < .01). In patients studied acutely, ABCD classifications improved after the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised arousal facilitation protocol (p < .05) but did not correspond with behavioral level of consciousness. These findings support the use of the ABCD framework to characterize channel-level EEG dynamics and track fluctuations in functional thalamocortical network integrity in spatial detail.

Resting-State Quantitative Electroencephalography Demonstrates Differential Connectivity in Adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder.	DOI: 10.1089/cap.2018.0166	Background: Biomarkers for psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents are urgently needed. This cross-sectional pilot study investigated quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), a promising intermediate biomarker, in pediatric patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared with healthy controls (HCs). We hypothesized that youth with MDD would have increased coherence (connectivity) and absolute alpha power in the frontal cortex compared with HC. Methods: qEEG was obtained in adolescents aged 14-17 years with MDD (n = 25) and age- and gender-matched HCs (n = 14). The primary outcome was overall coherence on qEEG in the four frequency bands (alpha, beta, theta, and delta). Other outcomes included frontal-only coherence, overall and frontal-only qEEG power, and clinician-rated measures of anhedonia and anxiety. Results: Average coherence in the theta band was significantly lower in MDD patients versus HCs, and also lower in frontal cortex among MDD patients. Seven node pairs were significantly different or trending toward significance between MDD and HC; all had lower coherence in MDD patients. Average frontal delta power was significantly higher in MDD versus HCs. Conclusions: Brain connectivity measured by qEEG differs significantly between adolescents with MDD and HCs. Compared with HCs, youth with MDD showed decreased connectivity, yet no differences in power in any frequency bands. In the frontal cortex, youth with MDD showed decreased resting connectivity in the alpha and theta frequency bands. Impaired development of a resting-state brain network (e.g., default mode network) in adolescents with MDD may represent an intermediate phenotype that can be assessed with qEEG.

Nodding syndrome.	DOI: 10.3201/eid1909.130401	An epidemic illness characterized by head nodding associated with onchocerciasis has been described in eastern Africa since the early 1960s; we summarize published reports and recent studies. Onset of nodding occurs in previously healthy 5-15-year-old children and is often triggered by eating or cold temperatures and accompanied by cognitive impairment. Its incidence has increased in Uganda and South Sudan over the past 10 years. Four case-control studies identified modest and inconsistent associations. There were nonspecific lesions seen by magnetic resonance imaging, no cerebrospinal fluid inflammation, and markedly abnormal electroencephalography results. Nodding episodes are atonic seizures. Testing has failed to demonstrate associations with trypanosomiasis, cysticercosis, loiasis, lymphatic filariasis, cerebral malaria, measles, prion disease, or novel pathogens; or deficiencies of folate, cobalamin, pyridoxine, retinol, or zinc; or toxicity from mercury, copper, or homocysteine. There is a consistent enigmatic association with onchocerciasis detected by skin snip or serologic analysis. Nodding syndrome is an unexplained epidemic epilepsy.

Rapid decline in body temperature before sleep: fluffing the physiological pillow?	DOI: 10.3109/07420529409055899	A novel approach to the analysis of body core temperature was employed in an effort to further clarify the temporal relationship between the nightly decline in body temperature and the timing of the onset of nocturnal sleep. Core body temperature and EEG sleep recordings were obtained from 10 healthy elderly subjects while they lived in the laboratory and self-selected bedtimes and wake-up times. A rate-of-change curve was then generated for each temperature data set, showing the relative magnitude by which body core temperature declined (or increased) from minute to minute across the recording period. The time at which the maximum rate of decline (MROD) occurred was determined, and this time was compared with subjects' self-selected bedtimes and with subsequent EEG-defined sleep onsets. Eight of the 10 subjects' body temperature curves showed a maximum rate of decline well before (mean 41 min) the decision was made to retire. There was a significant positive correlation between the amount of wakefulness within the first hour after initial sleep onset and MROD relative to both bedtime and sleep onset (rs = 0.70; p < 0.04). That is, the closer MROD occurred to either bedtime or sleep onset, the less wakefulness there was within the first hour after sleep onset. The findings indicate that the process of sleep initiation is most likely to occur when body temperature is declining at its maximum rate and is most successfully accomplished at this phase of the temperature cycle.

Auditory and visual event-related potentials in a controlled investigation of HIV infection.	DOI: 10.1016/0168-5597(93)90012-e	Auditory and visual event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were used to complement neuropsychological and medical assessment in neurologically healthy subjects with asymptomatic and symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Auditory and visual ERPs, recorded using standard oddball paradigms, disclosed delays in late waves (N2 and P3) in symptomatic subjects (CDC stage IV) when compared with matched controls. Abnormally delayed P3 waves in at least one modality were recorded in 41% of symptomatics and this was associated with deficits in neuropsychological performance, particularly psychomotor slowing. However, no differences in late wave latencies between asymptomatic and control subjects were found, though asymptomatics showed delays in auditory N1 and P2 latencies. The number of morphological abnormalities, such as indiscernible late waves as well as topographical variability of the P3 wave, was increased in both HIV seropositive groups and possibly indicates a distinct mechanism of impairment, different from latency delay. Whilst P3 delay in symptomatics was not associated with changes in immune function (T4 cells) there was, however, a link with anaemia and subclinical hepatic dysfunction.

Effects of L-histidine depletion and L-tyrosine/L-phenylalanine depletion on sensory and motor processes in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00203.x	Animal studies show that histamine plays a role in cognitive functioning and that histamine H3-receptor antagonists, which increase histaminergic function through presynaptic receptors, improve cognitive performance in models of clinical cognitive deficits. In order to test such new drugs in humans, a model for cognitive impairments induced by low histaminergic functions would be useful. Studies with histamine H1-receptor antagonists have shown limitations as a model. Here we evaluated whether depletion of L-histidine, the precursor of histamine, was effective in altering measures associated with histamine in humans and the behavioural and electrophysiological (event-related-potentials) effects.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging in children with optimally controlled hyperphenylalaninaemia.	DOI: 10.1007/BF00711594	This study was undertaken to investigate whether the white-matter changes on MRI and the EEG abnormalities detectable in treated adolescents and adults with hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) can be detected in younger children on an optimally controlled diet. The study included 17 children, 7-12 years of age, with HPA. The MRI of five healthy children were included in the blind evaluation of the MR images. According to mutation genotype and dietary tolerance of phenylalanine, 9 patients have severe HPA and 8 have moderate HPA, all requiring dietary treatment. Mild white-matter hyperintensity was detected in 1 of the 5 healthy children and in 10 of 17 patients. EEG was abnormal in 2 patients. This group of children was compared with a previously reported group of adolescents with HPA who had been treated according to the same dietary regimen. MRI changes and EEG abnormalities were significantly less frequent in the group of children than in the group of adolescents. It is suggested that the more frequent MRI changes and EEG abnormalities seen in adolescents are related to the fact that a relaxation of the dietary treatment after the age of 8 years is often accepted.

Acute ingestion of Ibuprofen does not influence the release of IL-6 or improve self-paced exercise in the heat despite altering cortical activity.	DOI: 10.1007/s00421-024-05452-z	The present study tested the hypothesis that ingesting 800 mg Ibuprofen prior to self-paced cycling at a fixed rating of perceived exertion (RPE) improves performance by attenuating the release of Interleukin (IL)-6 and its signalling molecules, whilst simultaneously modulating cortical activity and cerebral oxygenation to the brain. Eight healthy, recreationally active males ingested 800 mg Ibuprofen or a placebo ~ 1 h prior to performing fixed RPE cycling for 60 min in 35 °C and 60% relative humidity at an intensity of hard to very hard (RPE = 16) with intermittent maximal (RPE = 20) sprints every 10 min. Power output (PO), core and mean skin temperatures (Tc, Tsk), respectively, and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings at the frontal (Fz), motor (Cz) and Parietal (Pz) areas (90 s) were collected every 5 min. IL-6, soluble glycoprotein receptor (sgp130) and IL-6 receptor (R) were collected at pre-, 30 min and immediately post-exercise. Mean PO, HR, Tc and Tsk, and RPE were not different between trials (P ≥ 0.33). At end-exercise, the change in IL-6, sgp130 and sIL-6R was not different between trials (P ≥ 0.12). The increase in α and β activity did not differ in any cortices between trials (P ≥ 0.07); however, there was a significant reduction in α/β activity in the Ibuprofen compared to placebo trials at all sites (P ≤ 0.05). Ingesting a maximal, over-the-counter dose of Ibuprofen prior to exercise in the heat does not attenuate the release of IL-6, nor improve performance, but may influence cortical activity evidenced by a greater reduction in α/β activity.

Automated detection of ripple oscillations in long-term scalp EEG from patients with infantile spasms.	DOI: 10.1088/1741-2552/abcc7e	Objective.Scalp high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker of epileptogenicity in infantile spasms (IS) and many other epilepsy syndromes, but prior studies have relied on visual analysis of short segments of data due to the prevalence of artifacts in EEG. Here we set out to robustly characterize the rate and spatial distribution of HFOs in large datasets from IS subjects using fully automated HFO detection techniques.Approach.We prospectively collected long-term scalp EEG data from 12 subjects with IS and 18 healthy controls. For patients with IS, recording began prior to diagnosis and continued through initiation of treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The median analyzable EEG duration was 18.2 h for controls and 84.5 h for IS subjects (∼1300 h total). Ripples (80-250 Hz) were detected in all EEG data using an automated algorithm.Main results.HFO rates were substantially higher in patients with IS compared to controls. In IS patients, HFO rates were higher during sleep compared to wakefulness (median 5.5 min-1and 2.9 min-1, respectively;p = 0.002); controls did not exhibit a difference in HFO rate between sleep and wakefulness (median 0.98 min-1and 0.82 min-1, respectively). Spatially, IS patients exhibited significantly higher rates of HFOs in the posterior parasaggital region and significantly lower HFO rates in frontal channels, and this difference was more pronounced during sleep. In IS subjects, ACTH therapy significantly decreased the rate of HFOs.Significance.Here we provide a detailed characterization of the spatial distribution and rates of HFOs associated with IS, which may have relevance for diagnosis and assessment of treatment response. We also demonstrate that our fully automated algorithm can be used to detect HFOs in long-term scalp EEG with sufficient accuracy to clearly discriminate healthy subjects from those with IS.

Sleep in pituitary insufficient patients compared to patients with depression and healthy controls at baseline and after challenge with CRH.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.06.029	Sleep disturbances are prevalent in both patients with pituitary insufficiency and with depression. The role of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), involved in sleep regulation, has not been fully clarified. Pituitary insufficiency is an ideal model for studying sleep-endocrine effects since no consecutive hormone releases and feedback effects occur after hormone administration. 11 male patients with a chronic insufficiency of the anterior pituitary gland (PI) and under stable hormonal substitution were studied during three consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. The first night served for adapting to laboratory setting, during the second night placebo was administered and during the third night 4 × 50 μg CRH were injected in pulsatile fashion. Sleep parameters were additionally compared with those of 15 healthy male controls (C) and 15 male patients with depression (D). CRH administration was associated with a numerical increase of wake time (115 ± 15 to 131 ± 13 min) and a decrease of REM sleep (89 ± 8 to 80 ± 8 min), REM latency (69 ± 14 to 55 ± 9 min) and slow wave sleep (66 ± 16 to 57 ± 15 min). Yet, none of these changes reached statistical significance. PI showed a worse sleep profile as compared to both control groups, e.g. indicated by a significantly lower sleep efficiency index (PI:0.80 ± 0.03 vs. C:0.94 ± 0.01 vs. D:0.87 ± 0.03). In conclusion sleep-EEG changes after CRH in PI patients resemble those found in in part in patients with depression. Sleep in anterior pituitary insufficiency was impaired despite full hormonal substitution possibly suggesting an alteration of the receptor organisation of brain structures involved in sleep regulation.

DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.09.015	We reported previously that repetitive intravenous injections of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) around sleep onset prompt depression-like changes in certain sleep and endocrine activity parameters (e.g. decrease of slow-wave sleep during the second half of the night, blunted growth hormone peak, elevated cortisol concentration during the first half of the night). Furthermore a sexual dimorphism of the sleep-endocrine effects of the hormones growth hormone-releasing hormone and ghrelin was observed. In the present placebo-controlled study we investigated the effect of pulsatile administration of 4×50μg CRH on sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and nocturnal cortisol and GH concentration in young healthy women. After CRH compared to placebo, intermittent wakefulness increased during the total night and the sleep efficiency index decreased. During the first third of the night, REM sleep and stage 2 sleep increased and sleep stage 3 decreased. Cortisol concentration was elevated throughout the night and during the first and second third of the night. GH secretion remained unchanged. Our data suggest that after CRH some sleep and endocrine activity parameters show also depression-like changes in healthy women. These changes are more distinct in women than in men.

Effects of an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist on human sleep, sleep-associated memory consolidation, and blood monocytes.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bbi.2014.11.012	Pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) are major players in the interaction between the immune system and the central nervous system. Various animal studies report a sleep-promoting effect of IL-1 leading to enhanced slow wave sleep (SWS). Moreover, this cytokine was shown to affect hippocampus-dependent memory. However, the role of IL-1 in human sleep and memory is not yet understood. We administered the synthetic IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra (IL-1ra) in healthy humans (100mg, subcutaneously, before sleep; n=16) to investigate the role of IL-1 signaling in sleep regulation and sleep-dependent declarative memory consolidation. Inasmuch monocytes have been considered a model for central nervous microglia, we monitored cytokine production in classical and non-classical blood monocytes to gain clues about how central nervous effects of IL-1ra are conveyed. Contrary to our expectation, IL-1ra increased EEG slow wave activity during SWS and non-rapid eye movement (NonREM) sleep, indicating a deepening of sleep, while sleep-associated memory consolidation remained unchanged. Moreover, IL-1ra slightly increased prolactin and reduced cortisol levels during sleep. Production of IL-1 by classical monocytes was diminished after IL-1ra. The discrepancy to findings in animal studies might reflect species differences and underlines the importance of studying cytokine effects in humans.

Resting state functional MRI connectivity predicts hypothalamus-pituitary-axis status in healthy males.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.11.021	Homeostasis of the human stress response system is critically maintained by a hierarchical system of neural and endocrine elements for which intact negative feedback is important to prevent maladaptation towards stress. Such feedback is efficiently probed by the established combined dexamethasone-suppression/corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation (dex/CRH) test. Here we investigate which suprahypothalamic networks might modulate the response assessed by this neuroendocrine test. Combined resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI)/EEG was acquired in 20 healthy male volunteers along with dex/CRH profiles obtained on a different day outside the scanner. Seed-based network analysis and inter-seed cross correlation analysis for selected atlas-based limbic, paralimbic and medial prefrontal cortex seeds were correlated with stimulated cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) concentrations. Lower connectivity between a left hippocampus-based network and the right hippocampus significantly predicted stimulated cortisol concentration (R(2)=0.70, corrected pcluster=0.001). Six further significantly negative correlations were detected mainly in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The strongest positive correlation with stimulated hormone concentration was detected for the left subcallosal ACC (ACTH, R(2)=0.57, corrected pcluster=0.009). Inter-seed connectivity mainly pointed to hippocampal/amygdala interactions as correlates of the dex/CRH response. In conclusion, resting state functional connectivity patterns of limbic, particularly hippocampal, as well as cingulate and medial prefrontal areas can explain some of the variance of the dex/CRH test in healthy subjects. Functional connectivity analysis can be considered useful to study supra-hypothalamic control systems of the HPA axis.

Basal and adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulated plasma cortisol levels among Egyptian autistic children: relation to disease severity.

Influence of exogenous atrial natriuretic peptide on the nocturnal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sleep in healthy men.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.04.009	Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), originally found in the cardiac atria, is also widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) and has been predominantly found in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have provided evidence for an inhibitory control of ANP at all regulatory levels of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system. In vivo studies in man demonstrated that ANP inhibits stimulated pituitary-adrenal secretion during wakefulness. On the other hand, it has been reported that various neuropeptides not only influence the neuroendocrine compound of sleep, but also exert specific effects on the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG). To further characterize the role of ANP in the regulation of the nocturnal HPA axis activity and consecutive sleep regulation, we investigated sleep-endocrine effects of intravenously administered ANP in healthy men during nocturnal sleep. Eight volunteers underwent three trial conditions in random order and in a single-blind design receiving ANP infusion at the beginning of the 1st or the 2nd half of the night, or placebo. Sleep was assessed by polysomnography and blood samples were drawn in 30-min intervals for determination of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol during the entire night. While the ACTH and cortisol secretion during ANP infusions remained unchanged, an immediate increase of ACTH and cortisol secretion occurred after each infusion period for approximately 2h without changing basal levels and the circadian course of both hormones. Sleep EEG parameters were neither directly affected by ANP infusions nor by the following ANP-induced ACTH and cortisol secretion. The presence of such clear-cut enhancement of the pituitary-adrenal release indicates a rebound effect of ANP on HPA secretory activity and supports the idea that ANP acts as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-inhibiting factor.

Dex/CRH-test response and sleep in depressed patients and healthy controls with and without vulnerability for affective disorders.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2008.01.005	Sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities and increased hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity are the most prominent neurobiological findings in depression and were suggested as potential biomarker for depression. In particular, increased rapid eye movement sleep (REM) density, deficit in slow wave sleep and excessive stress hormone response are associated with an unfavorable long-term outcome of depression. Recent studies indicate that the sleep and endocrine parameters are related to each other. This study investigated the association of sleep structure including a quantitative EEG analysis with the results of the combined dexamethasone (Dex)/corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-test in 14 patients with a severe major depression, 21 healthy probands with a positive family history of depression (HRPs) and 12 healthy control subjects without personal and family history for psychiatric disorders. As expected patients with depression showed an overactivity of the HPA axis, disturbed sleep continuity and prolonged latency until slow wave sleep in the first sleep cycle. Differences in microarchitecture of sleep were less prominent and restricted to a higher NonREM sigma power in the HRP group. Dexamethasone suppressed cortisol levels were positively associated with higher NonREM sigma power after merging the three groups. We also observed an inverse association between the ACTH response to the Dex/CRH-test and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) density in HRPs, with suggestive evidence also in patients, but not in controls. This contra-intuitive finding might be a result of the subject selection (unaffected HRPs, severely depressed patients) and the complementarity of the two markers. HRPs and patients with high disease vulnerability, indicated by an elevated REM density, seem to have a lower threshold until an actual disease process affecting the HPA axis translates into depression, and vice versa. To summarize, our findings provide further evidence that the HPA axis is involved in the sleep regulation in depression. These associations, however, are not unidimensional, but dependent on the kind of sleep parameters as well as on the selection of the subjects.

Acute cortisol administration increases sleep depth and growth hormone release in patients with major depression.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2007.12.003	Acute administration of cortisol increases non-rapid-eye movement (non-REM) sleep, suppresses rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and stimulates growth hormone (GH) release in healthy subjects. This study investigates whether cortisol has similar endocrine and electrophysiological effects in patients with depression who typically show a pathological overactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. Fifteen depressed inpatients underwent the combined dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone test followed by three consecutive sleep EEG recordings in which the patients received placebo (saline) and hourly injections of cortisol (1mg/KG BW). Cortisol increased duration and intensity of non-REM sleep in particular in male patients and stimulated GH release. The activity of the HPA axis appeared to influence the cortisol-induced effects on non-REM sleep and GH levels. Stimulation of delta sleep was less pronounced in patients with dexamethasone nonsuppression. In contrast, REM sleep parameters were not affected by the treatment. These data demonstrate that the non-REM sleep-promoting effects of acute cortisol injections observed in healthy controls could be replicated in patients with depression. Our results suggest that non-REM and REM sleep abnormalities during the acute state of the disease are differentially linked to the activity of the HPA axis.

Systemic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) impairs sleep in healthy young women.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2007.07.008	In young male subjects peripherally administered growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) enhances GH and slow wave sleep (SWS) and blunts cortisol. In contrast, in a sample of females 19-76-year old, GHRH impairs sleep and enhances adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol. In the latter study, the days of investigation were not adapted to the menstrual cycle and premenopausal and postmenopausal women as well were included. Placebo and GHRH were given during consecutive nights. In order to confirm or reject the sexual dimorphism of the effects of GHRH on sleep we applied an improved study design. In the present study we examined the effect of pulsatile administration of two dosages of GHRH (4x25 or 4x50 microg intravenously, respectively) on sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and nocturnal hormone secretion in healthy young women according to a randomized schedule. To rule out the influence of gonadal hormone activity, the study was adapted to the phase of the menstrual cycle and was performed at 4-6th day of menstrual cycle. A carry-over effect was excluded by the interval of at least 4 weeks between examinations. Compared to placebo rapid-eye-movement sleep decreased during the first half of the night after 4x25 microg GHRH and sleep stage 4 decreased after 4x50 microg GHRH. After both dosages GH increased whereas ACTH and cortisol remained unchanged. This study confirms that systemic GHRH impairs sleep in women.

Nocturnal ghrelin, ACTH, GH and cortisol secretion after sleep deprivation in humans.	DOI: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2006.05.002	Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand of the growth hormone (GH) secretagogue (GHS) receptor. It is hypothesised to play a key role in energy balance stimulating food intake and body weight. Besides GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin, it is thought to be a regulating factor of GH release. Ghrelin also appears to be involved in sleep regulation. We showed recently that ghrelin promotes slow-wave sleep and the nocturnal release of GH, cortisol and prolactin in humans. Similarly, promotion of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep was reported in mice after systemic ghrelin. If ghrelin is a factor that induces and/or maintains sleep, it should be enhanced after a period of sleep deprivation (SD). To clarify this issue, nocturnal ghrelin, GH, ACTH and cortisol plasma concentrations were determined and simultaneously sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded (2300-0700 h) during sleep before and after 1 night of total SD in 8 healthy subjects. Compared to baseline, ghrelin levels increased earlier by a non-significant trend, already before the beginning of recovery sleep. Further a non-significant trend occurred, suggesting higher ghrelin secretion in the first half of the night. The ghrelin maximum was found significantly earlier after SD than at baseline. GH secretion during the first half of the night and total night after SD were elevated. ACTH and cortisol were also elevated, which was most pronounced during the second half of the night. No effects of SD on the time of the maximum were found for GH, ACTH and cortisol. The increase in ACTH after SD is a novel finding. Whereas the effects of SD on ghrelin levels were relatively weak, our findings are in line with the hypothesis that ghrelin is a sleep-promoting factor in humans. Ghrelin may be involved in sleep promotion after SD.

Sleep stage 2: an electroencephalographic, autonomic, and hormonal duality.	DOI: 10.1093/sleep/28.12.1535	It is generally thought that the electroencephalogram of sleep stage 2 is not uniform, depending on whether sleep stage 2 evolves toward slow-wave sleep (SWS) or toward rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

Acute cortisol administration promotes sleep intensity in man.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1300362	The neuronal mechanisms of sleep generation, in particular synchronization of brain activity in the process of non-rapid-eye movement (non-REM) sleep, has been elucidated in the past decade. A previous study of our group showed that acute administration of cortisol is known to increase slow-wave sleep and suppress rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in man. To further elucidate the non-REM sleep-promoting effects of cortisol with respect to the synchronization of cortical activity, it is important to establish a sleep-state-specific quantitative EEG analysis. We therefore investigated the effects of repetitive injections of hydrocortisone on spectral composition of sleep EEG in 10 healthy male young volunteers. In addition, we performed high-frequency blood samplings to assess the relation between changes in the sleep EEG and sleep-associated secretion of growth hormone (GH). Cortisol administration resulted in a significant increase in highly synchronized EEG activity including delta and theta frequencies, according to a higher amount of slow-wave sleep. This effect predominated in the first few hours of night sleep. REM sleep was decreased, which appeared to be secondary to the lengthened first sleep cycle. The cortisol-induced stimulation of GH release did not occur in correspondence with the increased slow-wave activity. In view of the sleep impairing properties of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and the sleep-promoting function of GH-releasing hormone, it appears likely that a negative feedback inhibition of endogenous CRH was the key mechanism mediating the observed results. The cortisol-induced effects on sleep intensity and sleep-associated GH secretion appeared to be driven by different mechanisms.

Nocturnal secretion of TSH and ACTH in male patients with depression and healthy controls.	DOI: 10.1016/s0022-3956(02)00004-3	Profound alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) systems at the hypophyseal level have been described in affective disorder. To precisely characterize the basal alterations of both axes during sleep, we simultaneously investigated sleep EEG and the secretion of thyrotropin, ACTH and cortisol in nine drug-free male patients with depression in comparison to 10 healthy age and sex matched controls. In depressed patients the nearly diametrical nocturnal secretion of thyrotropin and ACTH was disturbed by significantly blunted thyrotropin values (TSH AUC 51.96+/-5.68 vs. 87.23+/-13.63, P<0.05) and elevated ACTH values (ACTH AUC 1804+/-161 vs. 1538+/-130, P<0.05) compared to controls. Moreover, cross correlation analysis revealed a highly negative association of 0 lag between thyrotropin and ACTH and between thyrotropin and cortisol in the control sample, indicating a physiological nocturnal negative correlation of HPT and HPA system. In the patients sample these associations were weak and reached not statistical significance. Therefore, as a descriptive tool, the ratio TSH/ACTH revealed a significant group difference between controls and patients in the first half of the night (TSH/ACTH AUC 6.50+/-0.42 vs. 3.35+/-0.31, P<0.05). Sleep-EEG analysis showed a shortened REM latency, a decrease of stage 2 and an increase of awake time in the patients. Our data support the hypothesis that both hypophyseal hormones reflect a common dysregulation of both systems in depression probably due to impaired action of TRH-related corticotropin-release-inhibiting-factor (CRIF). The ratio TSH/ACTH might be a tool to characterize alterations of both the HPT and HPA axis in depression during the first half of the night.

Middle-aged men show higher sensitivity of sleep to the arousing effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone than young men: clinical implications.	DOI: 10.1210/jcem.86.4.7370	The prevalence of insomnia associated with emotional stress increases markedly in middle-age. Both the top and end hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, i.e. CRH and glucocorticoids, stimulate arousal/wakefulness and inhibit slow wave (deep) sleep in experimental animals and man. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that middle-age is characterized by increased sensitivity to the sleep-disturbing effects of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We studied 12 healthy middle-aged (45.1 +/- 4.9) and 12 healthy young (22.7 +/- 2.8) men by monitoring their sleep by polysomnography for 4 consecutive nights, including in tandem 1 adaptation and 2 baseline nights and a night during which we administered equipotent doses of ovine CRH (1 microg/kg, iv bolus) 10 min after sleep onset. Analyses included comparisons within and between groups using multiple ANOVA and regression analysis. Although both middle-aged and young men responded to CRH with similar elevations of ACTH and cortisol, the former had significantly more wakefulness and suppression of slow wave sleep compared with baseline sleep; in contrast, the latter showed no change. Also, comparison of the change in sleep patterns from baseline to the CRH night in the young men to the respective change observed in middle-aged men showed that middle-age was associated with significantly higher wakefulness and significantly greater decrease in slow wave sleep than in young age. We conclude that middle-aged men show increased vulnerability of sleep to stress hormones, possibly resulting in impairments in the quality of sleep during periods of stress. We suggest that changes in sleep physiology associated with middle-age play a significant role in the marked increase of prevalence of insomnia in middle-age.

On the gender differences in sleep-endocrine regulation in young normal humans.	DOI: 10.1159/000054487	Sleep-endocrine regulation in humans involves high activity of the somatotropic axis at the beginning of the night and an increase in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system during the night. Gender differences were examined with regard to sleep-endocrine regulation in young healthy controls (10 men, 9 women). The sleep EEG was recorded (23:00-07:00 h) and plasma samples were collected and analyzed for GH, cortisol and ACTH at 20-min intervals. Cortisol secretion was significantly higher in females during the first half of the night (F = 9.9, p < 0.05), while ACTH was not different. In women, sleep-EEG analysis showed less slow wave sleep (SWS) during the second half of the night (F = 4.5, p < 0.05) and a significantly greater decrease in SWS and delta activity from the first to the second half of the night (F = 3.7 and 7.4, respectively, p < 0.05). Sigma activity increased during the night in women only (F = 3.7, p < 0.05). Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that in women compared to men activity of hypothalamic CRH neurons and central CRH release is greater, but is not reflected by greater HPA activity.

Hyporesponsiveness of the pituitary to CRH during slow wave sleep is not mimicked by systemic GHRH.	DOI: 10.1159/000054406	During slow wave sleep (SWS) pituitary responsiveness to CRH is reduced. Since GHRH is involved in the promotion of SWS in humans and rats, it was examined whether the blunted CRH-induced ACTH and cortisol release during SWS could be mimicked by systemic GHRH. Young healthy men (n = 7) participated in 4 sleep-endocrine protocols: (A) lights off at 23.00 h, intravenous injection of 50 microgram CRH during the first SWS period; (B) lights off at 01.00 h, injection of 100 microgram GHRH at 23.00 h, followed by 50 microgram CRH at 23.30 h; (C) lights off at 01.00 h, injection of 50 microgram CRH at 23.30 h, and (D) lights off at 23.00 h, saline treatment only (= baseline condition). The sleep EEG was recorded during the lights off period and blood samples, collected every 20 min between 22.00 and 07.00 h, were assayed for GH, cortisol and ACTH. There was no significant difference in the sleep-associated GH peak between protocols. Plasma ACTH was significantly higher following CRH administration during wakefulness compared with CRH administration during SWS (protocols B and C vs. A; area under the curve (AUC) 23. 00-03.00 h: 9.6 +/- 4.8 and 7.3 +/- 2.0 vs. 6.1 +/- 1.1 ng/ml x min; p < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in plasma ACTH concentration between the baseline condition and protocol A (CRH administration during SWS). Similarly, cortisol was significantly enhanced compared with baseline following CRH during wakefulness only. CRH induced an increase in EEG activity in the sigma frequency range, both when it was administered during wakefulness and SWS, while this effect was reduced by pre-treatment with GHRH. In summary, our data suggest that (1) the blunted CRH-induced release of ACTH and cortisol during SWS is not mimicked by systemic GHRH administration, and (2) CRH enhances sigma EEG activity possibly via modulation of afferent pathways from the median eminence to the thalamus and this effect is reduced by pre-treatment with GHRH.

The Munich vulnerability study on affective disorders: overview of the cross-sectional observations at index investigation.	DOI: 10.1016/s0022-3956(98)00026-0	An altered nocturnal sleep pattern and a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system are neurobiological abnormalities typical for depression. A persistence of these neurobiological alterations during remission has been shown to be associated with an increased risk for a relapse. However, it remains unclear whether these persisting abnormalities are trait markers indicative of an increased vulnerability for affective disorders or only represent 'biological scars' acquired during past episodes. Thus, respective examinations need to be performed in the premorbid state in order to answer this open question.

Effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone on the sleep EEG and nocturnal hormone secretion in male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1159/000026513	Various peptides including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) exert selective effects on sleep structure and noctural secretions of cortisol and growth hormone (GH). In animal studies analeptic effects and sleep disturbances after thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) administration have been observed; studies of endocrine function in depressed patients suggest a pathological activity of CRH and TRH as compared with that in healthy volunteers. As the role of TRH in the regulation of the sleep endocrine pattern in humans has not yet been clarified, we performed a study to examine the effects of pulsatile administration of TRH on the sleep EEG pattern and the nocturnal secretions of cortisol and GH in 7 healthy male subjects. The sleep EEG was recorded from 23.00 to 07.00 h, and blood samples were collected every 20 min from 20.00 to 07.00 h for the analysis of GH and cortisol concentrations during intravenous administration of placebo or 4 x 50 microgram TRH at 22.00, 23.00, 24. 00, and 01.00 h. In contrast to the well-known effects of CRH on the sleep endocrine pattern, TRH exerts only a weak effect on the sleep EEG which is reflected in a slight decrease in sleep efficiency associated with a trend to wakefulness during the night. Furthermore, after TRH administration, the cortisol rise appeared earlier, and a nonsignificant tendency to an increased secretion of cortisol during the first half of the night was found. The GH secretion did not differ significantly after application of TRH or placebo. The activating, albeit weak, effect of TRH on the sleep EEG and nocturnal cortisol secretion in healthy volunteers confirms and adds to the results previously observed in animals. On the basis of these findings, we surmise that TRH may contribute to the disturbed sleep continuity seen in depressed patients, probably acting as a cofactor of CRH in a synergistic manner.

Reduced efficacy of growth hormone-releasing hormone in modulating sleep endocrine activity in the elderly.	DOI: 10.1016/s0197-4580(97)00106-1	In aging, a decline in sleep continuity, a decreased slow wave sleep, an earlier nocturnal cortisol rise, and a blunted growth hormone (GH) secretion occur. Pulsatile administration of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) in young controls enhanced slow wave sleep and suppressed cortisol release. We administered GHRH 4 x 50 microg or placebo i.v. to 13 healthy seniors (5 women, 8 men, mean age 69.3 y +/- 8.3 SD). We observed significantly reduced nocturnal awakenings and an increased first non-rapid-eye-movement sleep period. In a subgroup (n = 9), we found a significant activation of GH secretion but unchanged cortisol secretion. Our data underscore that GHRH is capable of promoting sleep in the elderly, but much less than in young subjects. Contrasting to young subjects, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system remains unaffected by GHRH in the elderly. These results provide further evidence that a decrease in the efficacy of GHRH is involved in the biological mechanisms underlying aging.

Longtime administration of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) does not restore the reduced efficiency of GHRH on sleep endocrine activity in 2 old-aged subjects--a preliminary study.	DOI: 10.1055/s-2007-979496	"Aging results in a more shallow sleep accompanied by a blunted growth hormone (GH) secretion. In young male normal controls repetitive administration of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) at the beginning of the night results in an increased secretion of GH, a blunting of cortisol and a stimulation of slow-wave sleep (SWS). In healthy elderly men and women, however, GHRH exerts only weak effects on sleep-endocrine activity. In a previous report continuous treatment of healthy elderly males by repetitive administration of GHRH (during 12 days administration with 100 micrograms GHRH i.v. at 9.00 h every second day, ""priming"") enhanced GHRH stimulated GH secretion at daytime markedly. We tested if priming with GHRH results in a more distinct modulation of the nocturnal hormone secretion and of the sleep EEG than acute administration of the peptide. Two elderly male controls spent first three consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory, the first of which served for adaptation to laboratory conditions. During the two other nights (at days 1 and 2) sleep EEG was recorded and blood was sampled for determining the secretion of GH, cortisol and ACTH. In one of the nights the subjects received 50 micrograms GHRH hourly between 22.00 h and 1.00 h (4 x 50 micrograms) or placebo. The next examination followed after the priming period at day 14 and the last was performed two weeks after treatment at day 28. After the baseline administration of 4 x 50 micrograms GHRH before priming no clear changes of sleep EEG towards improved sleep were detectable, whereas GH secretion was increased. After priming sleep period time and SWS time were lower compared to the baseline night with GHRH administration, whereas REM time duration increased. GHRH induced GH secretion was not enhanced after priming. ACTH secretion was markedly enhanced compared to baseline stimulation. We conclude that priming with GHRH has no sleep improving effect and does not change hormone secretion in elderly normal subjects. Hence in the elderly priming with GHRH is not capable to induce a rejuvenation of sleep endocrine activity."

Corticotropin-releasing hormone inhibits melatonin secretion in healthy volunteers--a potential link to low-melatonin syndrome in depression?	DOI: 10.1159/000127186	Interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system and melatonin secretion have been demonstrated, but only the effects of melatonin on the activity of the HPA system have been studied in man. Alterations of melatonin secretion described as low-melatonin syndrome have been demonstrated in patients suffering from a major depressive episode, and an inhibitory factor on melatonin secretion has been postulated. We investigated whether corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is thought to be involved in HPA abnormalities in depressed patients, can also suppress melatonin secretion in healthy volunteers. Ten healthy male human volunteers in a double-blind study design received randomized hourly intravenous injections from 08.00 to 18.00 h that contained 10 micrograms human CRH, 1 microgram adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or placebo to simulate pulsatile hormone secretion. Plasma melatonin and cortisol responses during the treatment and nocturnal sleep electroencephalograms after the treatment were recorded. Administration of CRH reduced melatonin secretion significantly below values obtained after administration of placebo and ACTH. Cortisol secretion was significantly enhanced by ACTH in comparison to both placebo and CRH. Electroencephalographic sleep parameters revealed no treatment effects. Our findings suggest that CRH has an inhibitory effect on the pineal secretion of melatonin in normal man. A mechanism via a release of cortisol was not supported by our results. Secondary hormonal effects from changes in nocturnal sleep architecture were excluded. Further investigation of the action of CRH on melatonin secretion as well as the mutual feedback between the HPA system and the pineal gland may extend our knowledge of neuroendocrine alterations mediating the adaptive response to stress and the eventual involvement in the pathogenesis of depression.

Changes in sleep-endocrine activity after growth hormone-releasing hormone depend on time of administration.	DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-2826.1997.00565.x	When administered intravenously (i.v.) in a pulsatile mode during the first half of the night to young normal controls, growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) results in increased growth hormone (GH) plasma levels and slow wave sleep (SWS) and blunted cortisol release. In the present study we investigated whether GHRH has the same effects when administered in the early morning. Seven normal young male volunteers had 2 sessions each in the sleep laboratory (23.00 to 10.00 h) during which the secretion of GH, cortisol and corticotropin (ACTH) and polygraphic recording were monitored. Verum (4 bolus injections of 50 micrograms GHRH) or placebo were injected i.v. at 04.00, 05.00, 06.00 and 07.00 h. GHRH stimulated GH plasma levels significantly whereas cortisol and ACTH were not altered. In the sleep-electroencephalogram, only rapid-eye-movement density was decreased significantly during the period of active medication; all other sleep parameters were unaffected. We suggest that the physiological occurring high activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical(HPA) system in the early morning prevents the effects of GHRH on cortisol plasma levels and SWS. Thus GHRH administered to healthy young men in the early morning hours has the same effect as GHRH administered during the first half of the night to patients with major depression who have HPA hyperactivity throughout the day.

Long-term otucome of West syndrome: a study of adults with a history of infantile spasms.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1996.tb00573.x	To our knowledge, ours is the first study to evaluate the outcome of infantile spasms (IS) in adult patients. We analyzed 214 children born between 1960 and 1976 who had been followed for 20-35 years or until death at 3 months to 30 years of age. Mortality was 31% (67 of 214 patients). Thirty-six of the surviving patients (24%) had normal (25 patients) or only slightly impaired (11 patients) intelligence as assessed by their educational abilities. Four had academic occupations. Eight were married or living unmarried with a partner. Five had healthy children. At follow-up, the EEGs of the 25 normal persons were either normal or slightly abnormal, demonstrated focal findings in 9 (36%), and had unspecific changes in 1. Focal abnormalities were not more common in patients with less good outcomes (37%). In patients with normal neurological outcomes, IS had been classified as cryptogenic only in 9 of 25 (36%) cases. Therefore, some patients with IS apparently have normal intelligence and socioeconomic status as adults, including patients whose spasms were either symptomatic or associated with focal EEG findings.

Effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone on respiratory parameters during sleep in normal men.	DOI: 10.1055/s-0029-1211356	Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is well-known to be a centrally acting respiratory stimulant after systemic application both in healthy subjects and in patients suffering from respiratory failure. In order to study the effects of CRH on sleep EEG and respiratory parameters during sleep, 14 healthy male volunteers were investigated in a single-blind placebo controlled design. After an adaptation night, polysomnography was performed during two successive nights between 23.00 hrs. and 7.00 hrs. During one night placebo was applied, on the other 50 micrograms ovine CRH was administered intravenously as a bolus every hour from 0.00 hrs. to 6.00 hrs. For the assessment of respiration, blood oxygen saturation and thoracic wall movements were measured, as well as nasal and oral airflow using the thermistor method. Sleep efficiency parameters and subjective perception of sleep quality were not affected following CRH. The following alterations were found regarding sleep architecture: REM sleep as well as slow wave sleep showed a tendency to decrease under CRH, whereas light sleep tended to increase. After an injection of CRH a stimulation of respiration could be observed, with an increase of tidal volume over a time interval of a few minutes. Blood oxygen saturation was only slightly increased. Cortisol and ACTH concentrations were found to be constantly elevated. These results indicate that respiration during sleep is clearly affected by CRH with only slight alterations of global sleep parameters. No association was found between stimulation of ventilation and the occurrence of arousals; the respiratory analeptic effect of CRH thus appears to be specific.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adrenocorticotropic Hormoneblood', 'Adult', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormonepharmacology', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisoneblood', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Oxygenblood', 'Placebos', 'Respirationdrug effects', 'Sleepdrug effectsphysiology', 'Sleep, REMdrug effects', 'Thoraxphysiology']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7584529/	['Corticotropin']	[16132265]	7584529	['1995']
Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)-induced effects on sleep EEG and nocturnal secretion of growth hormone, cortisol and ACTH in patients with major depression.	DOI: 10.1016/0022-3956(94)90008-6	Studies in normal human subjects and animals suggest that the neuropeptide growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a common regulator of the sleep EEG and nocturnal hormone secretion. In healthy volunteers GHRH prompts an increase in the amount of slow wave sleep (SWS) and in growth hormone (GH) secretion and blunting of cortisol release. Inhibition of GHRH may contribute to sleep-endocrine aberrances during depression. We tested the effects of pulsatile application of 4 x 50 micrograms GHRH on the sleep EEG and simultaneously investigated nocturnal hormone secretion in 10 inpatients (four females, six males) with the acute episode of major depression. In contrast to the effects of placebo, GH secretion increased distinctly and rapid-eye-movement (REM) density decreased during the second half of night. No other significant changes in sleep-endocrine activity, including SWS, cortisol and ACTH secretion, could be observed. We assume that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system activity and slow wave sleep are inert to the influence of GHRH during acute depression. Cortisol and ACTH remained unchanged even in a subsample of five younger (aged 19-28 years) patients. This observation is in contrast to our recent finding that cortisol secretion is blunted in young normal volunteers after GHRH. But on the other hand, GHRH is capable of stimulating GH and inducing a decrease in REM density in these subjects.

Influence of endotoxin on nocturnal sleep in humans.	DOI: 10.1152/ajpregu.1993.264.6.R1077	Sleepiness is a common complaint during infectious diseases, but the interaction between sleep and host defense mechanisms has been poorly explored in humans. We therefore studied the effect of endotoxin, a major pathophysiological factor in gram-negative bacterial infections, on sleep and on parameters of the primary host response in men. In a single-blind counterbalanced trial, 15 healthy volunteers received either placebo or Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin (0.4 ng/kg body wt) intravenously on two separate occasions. Nocturnal sleep was recorded, and rectal temperature and the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol were monitored for 12 h. Endotoxin reduced the relative amounts of wakefulness (P < 0.05) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep (P < 0.05) and increased the relative amount of non-REM sleep (P < 0.01). Electroencephalogram delta power during non-REM sleep, as measured by spectral analysis, was not altered by endotoxin. The endotoxin-induced changes in sleep structure were related temporally and quantitatively to the increases in rectal temperature and to the release of cytokines and neurohormones. It is concluded that cytokines and neurohormones mediate the effects of endotoxin upon sleep. The ensuing increase in non-REM sleep may be part of the adaptive host response to bacterial infections in humans.

Sleep architecture and sleep apnea in patients with Cushing's disease.	DOI: 10.1093/sleep/15.6.514	Patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) frequently have sleep complaints. We evaluated sleep polysomnographically in 22 patients, including 17 with pituitary-ACTH-dependent Cushing's disease (CD) and five with CS from an adrenal tumor. Data were compared to healthy controls of comparable age. Seven patients (32%) demonstrated at least mild sleep apnea (> or = 9.4 events/hour), and four of 22 (18%) had > or = 17.5 events/hour. The apneic CD and CS patients had a trend for a greater complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness. Both apneic and nonapneic groups had considerable snoring and obesity. The electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep of nonapneic patients was compared to that of normal subjects. Nonapneic CD patients differed strikingly from healthy volunteers in sleep continuity and architecture, demonstrating lighter, fragmented sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in CD patients bore many similarities to the sleep of patients with major depression, with REM latency being significantly shortened and REM density significantly increased. Continued examination of EEG sleep in CD patients may shed light on similarities in pathophysiology between CD and major depression, disorders which are characterized by both a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and alterations in mood.

Psychometric, polysomnographic, and neuroendocrine measures in subjects at high risk for psychiatric disorders: preliminary results.	DOI: 10.1159/000119428	We report on the psychometric, polysomnographic, and neuroendocrine status of 12 subjects at high familial risk for psychiatric disorders and of 10 healthy subjects not at high risk. The psychometric measurements in the high-risk probands revealed an accentuated 'stress personality' pattern and an increased neuroticism score. Their all-night EEG sleep tended to be shallower than that of the control subjects (i.e., decreased sleep efficiency, more frequent awakenings, less slow-wave sleep), whereas they did not differ on REM sleep parameters. The challenge of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system with corticotropin-releasing hormone after pretreatment with dexamethasone yielded no differences in cortisol secretion between the groups. On an intraindividual level, however, all subjects at high risk except one were found to be conspicuous in at least one of the three states examined.

Respiratory-related evoked potentials elicited by inspiratory occlusions in double-lung transplant recipients.	DOI: 10.1152/japplphysiol.01218.2001	This study investigated the role of lung vagal afferents in the respiratory-related evoked potential (RREP) response to inspiratory occlusions by using double-lung transplant recipients as a lung denervation model. Evoked potential recordings in response to inspiratory occlusions were obtained from 10 double-lung transplant (DLT) recipients with normal lung function and 12 healthy control (Nor) subjects under the attend, ignore, and unoccluded conditions. Results demonstrated that early-latency RREP components (P(1), P(1a), N(f), and N(1)) were not significantly different between the DLT and the Nor groups. The late-latency RREP component (P(3)) was identifiable in all DLT subjects during the attend trial. However, P(3) latency was significantly longer in the DLT group compared with the Nor group. The zero-to-peak amplitude of P(3) was also significantly smaller in the DLT group than that in the Nor group during the attend trial. These results suggest that lung vagal afferents were not essential to elicit RREP responses, but may contribute to the cognitive processing of respiratory stimuli.

Acute administration of roflumilast enhances immediate recall of verbal word memory in healthy young adults.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.12.019	The need for new and effective treatments for dementia remains indisputably high. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE-Is) have proven efficacy as cognitive enhancers based on their positive effects in numerous preclinical studies. Especially the PDE4 subfamily is of interest due to its expression in the hippocampus, the key structure for memory formation. The current study investigates the memory enhancing effects of the clinically approved PDE4-I roflumilast in a test battery including the Verbal Learning Task (VLT) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) recording. This acute study was conducted according to a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover design. Three capsulated dosages of roflumilast HCl (Daxas) and a placebo were administered in four study periods. Administration occurred 1 h before testing to reach maximal plasma concentrations. Memory performance was assessed using a 30 word Verbal Learning Task. The number of words recalled both immediately and after 45 min and 24 h were included as outcome measures. EEG was recorded during the cognitive tasks on the first day. Different event-related potentials (ERPs) were considered with special emphasis on P600, as this peak has been related to word learning. Memory performance was significantly improved after acute administration of 100 μg roflumilast.

Acute administration of roflumilast enhances sensory gating in healthy young humans in a randomized trial.	DOI: 10.1007/s00213-017-4770-y	Sensory gating is a process involved in early information processing which prevents overstimulation of higher cortical areas by filtering sensory information. Research has shown that the process of sensory gating is disrupted in patients suffering from clinical disorders including attention deficit hyper activity disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors have received an increased interest as a tool to improve cognitive performance in both animals and man, including sensory gating.

Assessment of School-Aged Children of Mothers With Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1097/NMD.0000000000001039	The aim is to examine the cognitive domains, behavioral domains, and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings in children of mothers with idiopathic generalized epilepsy who had been exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in utero. Forty school-aged children born to 23 mothers with idiopathic generalized epilepsy were compared with 40 healthy children born to 34 healthy mothers. Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale was applied to all children to assess their cognitive functions. Child Behavior Checklist was used to assess their behavioral characteristics. EEG was done for the epileptic mothers and their children. Children exposed to AEDs showed significantly lower scores in the verbal reasoning, visual reasoning, and global intelligence quotient (IQ). There was a significantly positive correlation between children's global IQ and maternal global IQ. Multiple regression analysis showed that in utero exposure to valproate and maternal IQ were the most independent factors affecting children's IQ. EEG findings of participating children were normal. Exposure to valproic acid during fetal life and maternal IQ represent confounding factors affecting the IQ of children with in utero exposure to AEDs.

Auditory startle response is normal in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1007/s10072-015-2181-6	Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is hypothesized to originate from the dysfunction of thalamo-cortical circuit. We aimed to analyze any changes in auditory startle response in JME patients to determine the role of brainstem in JME. The responses of 18 JME patients to auditory simulation were recorded over the unilateral orbicularis oculi, masseter, sternocleidomastoid, and extremity muscles. Results were compared with those of 18 age and gender matched healthy volunteers. Total auditory startle response frequencies were similar between the two groups (31.1 ± 11.1 % vs. 33.7 ± 8.7 %, p = 0.400). Other parameters over each muscle were also similar. There were no impacts of antiepileptic drug use or disease duration. We may conclude that our findings may provide sufficient evidence for the lack of functional changes of the auditory startle response circuit even in longstanding cases of JME.

In addition, there is some evidence indicating that deficits in mismatch negativity and P3a amplitude are related to increased dopaminergic activity.

Effects of dopamine D2/D3 blockade on human sensory and sensorimotor gating in initially antipsychotic-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2014.152	It has been suggested that psychophysiological measures of sensory and sensorimotor gating, P50 gating and prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex (PPI), underlie core features of schizophrenia and are linked to dopaminergic pathways in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. In the present study, the effects of a potent D2/D3 receptor antagonist, amisulpride, were investigated on PPI and P50 gating in a large sample of antipsychotic-naive, first-episode patients with schizophrenia. A total of 52 initially antipsychotic-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients were assessed for their P50 gating, PPI, and habituation/sensitization abilities at baseline and after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment with flexible doses of amisulpride. In addition, 47 matched healthy controls were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks. At baseline, the patients showed significantly reduced PPI, yet normal levels of P50 gating, habituation, and sensitization. Treatment with amisulpride showed no effects on these measures, either at 2 or 6 weeks of follow-up. This is the first study investigating the effects of monotherapy with a relatively selective dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist (amisulpride) on sensory and sensorimotor gating deficits in a longitudinal study of a large group of initially antipsychotic-naive, first-episode patients with schizophrenia. Our finding that amisulpride effectively reduced symptom severity in our patients without reducing their PPI deficits indicates that increased activity of dopamine D2 receptors may be involved in symptomatology of patients with schizophrenia, but not in their sensorimotor gating deficits.

Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in four experimental occasions during each of which they were dosed with one of the following anti-psychotic drugs: chlorpromazine (50 mg), haloperidol (3 mg), sulpiride (400 mg) and placebo. Drugs were allocated to subjects in a double-blind, crossover fashion. 2. The subject's mood state, psychometric performance and electroencephalogram (EEG) were assessed pre-dose, and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 h post-dose. Mood states were assessed using 16 visual analogue scales and psychomotor performance was measured using the following tests: elapsed time estimation, tapping rate, choice reaction times, a rapid information processing task, flash fusion threshold, a manipulative motor task, digit span, body sway and tremor. 3. Chlorpromazine and haloperidol significantly reduced subjective ratings of 'alertness' and 'contentedness', and haloperidol significantly reduced feelings of 'calmness'. Sulpiride did not significantly affect any of the visual analogue scales. 4. All three anti-psychotic drugs had similar EEG effects with peak effect 2 to 4 h postdose. The profile was characterised by an increase in the proportion of slow wave activity (delta and theta) as well as decreased alpha (8-14 Hz) and faster (beta) wave activity. 5. Chlorpromazine reduced tapping rate and increased choice reaction movement times. Haloperidol reduced the flash fusion threshold frequency at 6 h post-dose. Sulpiride prolonged the duration of the manipulative motor task, particularly at 48 h post-dose. 6. All three anti-psychotic drugs impaired performance on the rapid information processing task. Chlorpromazine significantly reduced the number of correct letter pair identifications at 2, 4 and 6 h post-dose, haloperidol at 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 h post-dose, and sulpiride at 24 h post-dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Chlorpromazinepharmacology', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'Haloperidolpharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain Measurementdrug effects', 'Psychomotor Performancedrug effects', 'Reaction Timedrug effects', 'Sulpiridepharmacology']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2288826/	['S-(-)-sulpiride', 'S-(-)-sulpiride', 'Sulpiride']	[44134959, 5355]	2288826	['1990', 'Dec']

Control of clustered action potential firing in a mathematical model of entorhinal cortex stellate cells.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.04.013	The entorhinal cortex is a crucial component of our memory and spatial navigation systems and is one of the first areas to be affected in dementias featuring tau pathology, such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Electrophysiological recordings from principle cells of medial entorhinal cortex (layer II stellate cells, mEC-SCs) demonstrate a number of key identifying properties including subthreshold oscillations in the theta (4-12 Hz) range and clustered action potential firing. These single cell properties are correlated with network activity such as grid firing and coupling between theta and gamma rhythms, suggesting they are important for spatial memory. As such, experimental models of dementia have revealed disruption of organised dorsoventral gradients in clustered action potential firing. To better understand the mechanisms underpinning these different dynamics, we study a conductance based model of mEC-SCs. We demonstrate that the model, driven by extrinsic noise, can capture quantitative differences in clustered action potential firing patterns recorded from experimental models of tau pathology and healthy animals. The differential equation formulation of our model allows us to perform numerical bifurcation analyses in order to uncover the dynamic mechanisms underlying these patterns. We show that clustered dynamics can be understood as subcritical Hopf/homoclinic bursting in a fast-slow system where the slow sub-system is governed by activation of the persistent sodium current and inactivation of the slow A-type potassium current. In the full system, we demonstrate that clustered firing arises via flip bifurcations as conductance parameters are varied. Our model analyses confirm the experimentally suggested hypothesis that the breakdown of clustered dynamics in disease occurs via increases in AHP conductance.

A total of 200 epileptic cases and 200 healthy controls enrolled to this study. Genomic DNAs from the patients and control cases were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. There were significant associations between the G/T genotype of KCNJ10 gene rs2486253 polymorphism in the idiopathic generalized epilepsy group (P = .037) and in subjects with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (P = .0015). T allele was also increased in patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (P = .0158). However, no statistically significant association was found between rs61822012 polymorphism and epilepsy. Our data suggest that G/T genotype of the KCNJ10 gene rs2486253 polymorphism affects risk for development of common types of childhood epilepsy.

Dose-response studies with co-dergocrine mesylate under hypoxia utilizing EEG mapping and psychometry.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02245477	In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, human brain function and mental performance were studied under two different degrees of hypoxia after administration of two different doses (6 mg and 9 mg) of co-dergocrine mesylate (CDM) utilizing blood gas analysis, EEG mapping and psychometry. Hypoxic hypoxidosis (i.e. impairment of cerebral metabolism due to hypoxia) was experimentally induced by a fixed gas combination of 9.8% oxygen (O2) and 90.2% nitrogen (N2) (found in 6000 m altitude), and of 8.6% O2, 91.4% N2 (found in 7000 m altitude), which was inhaled for 23 min under normobaric conditions by 18 healthy volunteers. They received randomized after an adaptation session placebo, 6 mg and 9 mg co-dergocrine mesylate (CDM). Evaluation of blood gases, brain mapping and psychometry was carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 h after oral drug administration. Blood gas analysis demonstrated a drop in PO2 to 42 and 32 mm Hg 23 min after inhalation of the 9.8% and 8.6% gas mixture, respectively, PCO2 decreased to 32 and 31 mm Hg, pH increased to 7.46 and 7.47 and base excess increased to 0.50 and 0.90 nmol/l, respectively. EEG mapping demonstrated an increase in delta and decrease of alpha power and a slowing of the centroid over almost the whole brain. 6 mg and slightly less so 9 mg CDM attenuated this deterioration of vigilance (i.e. dynamic state of the neuronal network determining adaptive behavior). At the behavioral level, moderate hypoxia induced a deterioration of noopsychic performance, which was mitigated by 6 mg, but not by 9 mg CDM. A deepening of the hypoxia resulted in a loss of these brain protective effects of both doses. Decrement of the thymopsyche increased after both doses in the moderate hypoxic condition, while under marked hypoxia 6 mg CDM attenuated and 9 mg aggravated this deterioration. Time-wise, brain protective effects reached the level of statistical difference between the 2nd and the 6th hour. Somatic complaints like feeling dazed, giddiness and headache were mitigated dose dependently by CDM in the moderate, but not in the marked hypoxic hypoxidosis.

On brain protection of co-dergocrine mesylate (Hydergine) against hypoxic hypoxidosis of different severity: double-blind placebo-controlled quantitative EEG and psychometric studies.		Utilizing quantitative EEG and psychometric methods we investigated in two subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled trials the following questions: 1) Does co-dergocrine mesylate (CDM) protect against cerebral hypoxic hypoxidosis as objectivated by neurophysiological and behavioral measures in man? 2) Does CDM offer protection equally both against moderate and marked hypoxia induced experimentally by inhalation of a gas mixture of 9.8% and 8.6% O2 (equivalent to 6000 m and 7000 m altitude, respectively)? 3) Are brain-protective effects of CDM improving by drug administration over a longer period of time (2 weeks)? In the first study, hypoxic hypoxidosis was induced by a fixed gas combination of 9.8% oxygen and 90.2% N2 (equivalent to 6000 m altitude), which was inhaled for 23 min under normobaric conditions by 15 healthy volunteers. They received randomized after an adaptation session placebo and 5 mg CDM. Blood gases, quantitative EEG, and psychometric measures were obtained under normoxic (21% O2) and hypoxic (9.8% O2) conditions before as well as 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after oral drug administration. Blood gas analysis demonstrated under hypoxia a drop in PO2 from 91 to 37 mmHg and in PCO2 from 38 to 33 mmHg, while pH increased from 7.41 to 7.47. Computer-assisted spectral analysis of the EEG showed an increase of delta/theta, decrease of alpha, and an increase of superimposed fast beta activity indicative of deterioration in vigilance. The latter was documented at the behavioral level by deterioration of intellectual and mnestic functions, psychomotor activity, performance in a reaction time task, mood, and wakefulness. CDM attenuated significantly this brain dysfunction, as it attenuated delta/theta and increased alpha-adjacent beta activity. Psychometric performance based on all 11 variables deteriorated under hypoxia by 49% after placebo, while after 5 mg CDM only by 26%. However, in a subsequent double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 12 healthy young volunteers, further augmentation of hypoxia induced by inhalation of a gas combination of 8.6% O2 and 91.4% N2 (equivalent to 7000 m altitude) leading to a drop of PO2 and PCO2 to 32 and 32 mmHg, respectively and an increase of pH to 7.46 resulted in a loss of brain protection, even when CDM was given over 2 weeks daily. Our findings suggest that treatment of organic brain syndromes with nootropic/antihypoxidotics should be initiated in an early rather than a late stage.

Extreme prematurity in healthy 5-year-old children: a re-analysis of sex effects on event-related brain activity.		A male disadvantage has been reported in several outcome studies of children born preterm. Twenty-two healthy premature children (10 girls, 12 boys) born between 25 and 28 weeks of gestation and 20 controls born full-term (10 boys, 10 girls) were matched on socioeconomical status and age. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded by using 14 electrodes in a visual oddball task, with 75% frequent and 25% rare stimuli. This task elicited a larger P3 to the rare than to the frequent stimuli, with a prominent parietocentral localization. However, the amplitude was larger in full-term boys than in full-term girls, a difference that was not observed between preterm boys and preterm girls, especially to targets and on the central electrodes. In addition, the preterm group was characterized by a frontal slow wave larger in boys than in girls. In these prematures, the lack of the sex-related difference may be accounted by differences in the strength of the neuronal generators in males, as they might have been affected by the high level of androgens by the fetal testis under the control of placental gonadotropes during the first two thirds of gestation.

Working memory-related alterations in neural oscillations reveal the influence of in-vehicle toluene on cognition at low concentration.	DOI: 10.1007/s11356-022-23627-z	Although toluene is a typical in-vehicle pollutant, the impacts of in-vehicle toluene exposure on cognitive functions remain unestablished. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term toluene exposure in vehicles on working memory based on neural oscillations. In total, 24 healthy adults were recruited. Each subject was exposed to four different concentrations of toluene and divided into 0 ppb, 17.5 ppb, 35 ppb, and 70 ppb groups for self-control studies. After 4 h of exposure to each concentration of toluene, a behavioral test of visual working memory was performed while 19-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were collected. Meanwhile, the power spectral density (PSD) and spatial distribution of working memory encoding, maintenance, and extraction periods were calculated by short-time Fourier transform to clarify the characteristic frequency bands, major brain regions, and characteristic channels of each period. To compare the changes in the characteristic patterns of neural oscillations under the effect of different concentrations of toluene. There was no significant difference in working memory reaction time and correct rate between the groups at different toluene concentrations (p > 0.05). The characteristic frequency band of the working memory neural oscillations in each group was the theta frequency band; the PSD of the theta frequency band was predominantly concentrated in the frontal area, and the characteristic channel was the Fz channel. The whole brain (F = 3.817, p < 0.05; F = 4.758, p < 0.01; F = 3.694, p < 0.05), the frontal area (F = 2.505, p < 0.05; F = 2.839, p < 0.05; F = 6.068, p < 0.05), the Fz channel (F = 3.522, p < 0.05; F = 3.745, p < 0.05; F = 6.526, p < 0.05), and the PSD of working memory in the theta frequency band was significantly increased in the 70 ppb group compared with the other three groups during the coding, maintenance, and retrieval phases of working memory. When the in-vehicle toluene exposure concentration was 70 ppb, the PSD of the characteristic frequency bands of working memory was significantly increased in the whole brain, major brain regions, and characteristic channels.

Alternations in neural oscillation related to attention network reveal influence of indoor toluene on cognition at low concentration.	DOI: 10.1111/ina.13067	Despite accumulative literature reporting negative impacts of high-concentration toluene, cognitive effects of toluene at low concentration are still unclear. Twenty-two healthy college students were exposed in a closed environmental chamber to investigate the influence of indoor toluene on cognitive performance and brain activity. During each toluene exposure condition (0 ppb, 17.5 ppb, 35 ppb, and 70 ppb), attention network test and electroencephalogram (EEG) recording were synchronously performed after 4-hour toluene exposure. Characteristic neural oscillation patterns in three attention networks were compared between four groups. The statistical analyses indicated that short-term exposure to toluene had no significant impact on behavioral performance of attention network. However, there was a significant increase in the power of theta and alpha band of executive network and orienting network in the whole brain, especially in frontal region when exposed to toluene. Besides, no significant difference was observed in alerting network. The alternations in neural oscillation demonstrated that more effort was required to accomplish the same tasks when exposed to toluene. The present study revealed that short-term exposure to toluene affected brain activity of attention network even at low concentration, which provided a theoretical basis for the development of safer evaluation methods and standards in the future.

Neurobehavioral and neurophysiological effects after acute exposure to a single peak of 200 ppm toluene in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuro.2015.03.005	The solvent toluene has neurotoxic properties that are especially relevant in the working environment. Short-term exposure limits (STELs) vary from 50 ppm up to 300 ppm across countries but their acute effects remain elusive in humans. Several in vitro and in vivo studies elucidated that toluene acutely acts by perturbations of different neurotransmitter systems. More specifically visual evoked potentials (VEPs) of rats are decreased after acute toluene exposure, leading to the assumption that particularly visual attention processes might be a target of toluene in humans. Therefore a visual change detection task was applied to measure both neurobehavioral and neurophysiological effects by using electroencephalography (EEG) after a single peak exposure to 200 ppm toluene. Performance and event-related components of the EEG were examined before and after exposure in a toluene-exposed and a control group. Thirty-three young healthy volunteers participated in this study. The behavioral results of the experiment indicate that toluene impairs the rate of correct responses especially in task conditions in which an irrelevant distractor is given, while the response times did not differ between both groups. The neurophysiological findings hint toward a less efficient visual processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli and an increased distractibility by irrelevant distractors. Thus the present results are a promising starting point for further research specifically targeting visual attention after toluene exposure and the reconsideration of the presently very heterogeneous STELs.

Dynamics and kinetics of a modified-release formulation of zolpidem: comparison with immediate-release standard zolpidem and placebo.	DOI: 10.1177/0091270006293303	Modified-release (MR) zolpidem was developed to maintain effective plasma concentrations during the 3- to 6-hour post-dosage interval, corresponding to the middle portion of the typical sleep interval. Modified-release zolpidem (12.5 mg), standard immediate-release (IR) zolpidem (10 mg), and placebo were compared in a double-blind, single-dose, 3-way crossover daytime study of healthy volunteers (n = 70 completers). Effect areas for electroencephalographic beta amplitude during 0 to 8 hours and 3 to 6 hours after dosage were greater for MR compared to IR (P < .001). The digit-symbol substitution test and sedation rating scales behaved similarly. MR and IR did not differ in effects at 8 hours post-dosage nor in halflife or clearance. Time of peak plasma concentration (tmax) was significantly longer for MR (2.4 vs 2.0 hours, P < .004), and dose-normalized peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was lower (12.2 vs 14.0 ng/mL/mg, P < .001). MR zolpidem also had greater area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) during the 3- to 6-hour interval (P < .001). Thus, MR zolpidem produces sustained plasma levels compared to IR, with resulting enhancement of pharmacodynamic effects in the 3- to 6-hour post-dosage interval.

Mean-field modeling of thalamocortical dynamics and a model-driven approach to EEG analysis.	DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1012168108	Higher brain function depends on task-dependent information flow between cortical regions. Converging lines of evidence suggest that interactions between cortical regions and the central thalamus play a key role in establishing the dynamic patterns of functional connectivity that normally support these processes. In patients with chronic disturbances of cognitive function due to severe brain injury, dysfunction of this circuitry likely plays a crucial role in pathogenesis. However, assaying thalamocortical interactions is challenging even in healthy subjects and more so in severely impaired patients. To approach this problem, we apply a dynamical-systems approach to motivate an analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG). We begin with a model for a single thalamocortical module [Robinson PA, Rennie CJ, Rowe DL (2002) Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys 65:041924; Robinson PA, Rennie CJ, Wright JJ, Bourke PD (1998) Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys 58:3557-3571]. When two such modules interact via shared thalamic inhibition, multistable behavior emerges; each mode is characterized by a different pattern of coherence between cortical regions. This observation suggests that changing patterns of cortical coherence are a hallmark of normal thalamocortical dynamics. In a preliminary study, we test this idea by analyzing the EEG of a patient with chronic brain injury, who has a marked improvement in behavior and frontal brain metabolism in response to zolpidem. The analysis shows that following zolpidem administration, changing patterns of coherence are identified between the frontal lobes and between frontal and distant brain regions. These observations support the role of the central thalamus in the organization of patterns of cortical interactions and suggest how indexes of thalamocortical dynamics can be extracted from the EEG.

EEG profile of intravenous zolpidem in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02245455	Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine which binds specifically to the omega 1 receptor. Zolpidem demonstrated potent hypnotic activity at a dose of 10 mg. Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of zolpidem were studied after daytime administration in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. Single doses of zolpidem (10 mg IV as a 3-min infusion and 20 mg orally) and placebo were firstly tested in 12 healthy young male volunteers. Two other doses (5 mg IV and orally) were then evaluated in 6 out of these 12 subjects. EEG (4 leads = Fp2-T4, Fp1-T3, T4-02 and T3-01), and Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) were measured up to 5 h postdosing. Blood samples were also collected up to 24 h. The time course of the hypnotic activity of zolpidem, assessed by the score obtained on SSS, showed a similar profile whatever the route or the dose administered: slightly earlier onset after IV but sedative scores were reached at 30 min and the effect peaked between 1 and 1.5 h and lasted 4 h in both conditions. The EEG profile of zolpidem was characterised by a decrease of alpha activity and an increase in delta and in beta activity. The effect on beta activity was marked within the first hour and then disappeared. The time course of delta and alpha activities indicated a rapid onset (10 min after IV, 30 min after oral route) and a duration of 3-4 h. The amplitude of these relative EEG changes and their duration were independent of the route of administration and the dose administered. AUC and Cmax increased proportionally to the administered dose and elimination half life (2h), clearance and volume of distribution did not change according to the dose or the route of administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Alpha Rhythmdrug effects', 'Beta Rhythmdrug effects', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Delta Rhythmdrug effects', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypnotics and Sedativesadverse effectspharmacokineticspharmacology', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Pyridinesadverse effectspharmacokineticspharmacology', 'Sleep Stagesdrug effects', 'Zolpidem']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7846196/	['Zolpidem', 'PYRIDINE']	[5732, 1049]	7846196	['1994', 'Feb']
Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and the pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic relationship of zolpidem in healthy subjects.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881109106898	Zolpidem is one of the most frequently prescribed hypnotics, as it is a very short-acting compound with relatively few side effects. Zolpidem's short duration of action is partly related to its short elimination half-life, but the associations between plasma levels and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects are not precisely known. In this study, the concentration-effect relationships for zolpidem were modelled. Zolpidem (10 mg) was administered in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to determine PD and pharmacokinetics (PK) in 14 healthy volunteers. Zolpidem was absorbed and eliminated quickly, with a median T(max) of 0.78 h (range: 0.33-2.50) and t(1/2) of 2.2 h. Zolpidem reduced saccadic peak velocity (SPV), adaptive tracking performance, electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha power and visual analogue scale (VAS) alertness score and increased body sway, EEG beta power and VAS 'feeling high'. Short- and long-term memory was not affected. Central nervous system effects normalised more rapidly than the decrease of plasma concentrations. For most effects, zolpidem's short duration of action could be adequately described by both a sigmoid E(max) model and a transit tolerance model. For SPV and EEG alpha power, the tolerance model seemed less suitable. These PK/PD models have different implications for the mechanism underlying zolpidem's short duration of action. A sigmoid E(max) model (which is based on ligand binding theory) would imply a threshold value for the drug's effective concentrations. A transit tolerance model (in which a hypothetical factor builds up with time that antagonises the effects of the parent compound) is compatible with a rapid reversible desensitisation of GABAergic subunits.

The current electroencephalography study into the antidepressant properties of ketamine investigated the downstream effects of ketamine on predictive coding and short-term plasticity in thirty patients with depression using the auditory roving mismatch negativity (rMMN). The rMMN paradigm was run 3-4 h after a single 0.44 mg/kg intravenous dose of ketamine or active placebo (remifentanil infused to a target plasma concentration of 1.7 ng/mL) in order to measure the neural effects of ketamine in the period when an improvement in depressive symptoms emerges. Depression symptomatology was measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); 70% of patients demonstrated at least a 50% reduction their MADRS global score. Ketamine significantly increased the MMN and P3a event related potentials, directly contrasting literature demonstrating ketamine's acute attenuation of the MMN. This effect was only reliable when all repetitions of the post-deviant tone were used. Dynamic causal modelling showed greater modulation of forward connectivity in response to a deviant tone between right primary auditory cortex and right inferior temporal cortex, which significantly correlated with antidepressant response to ketamine at 24 h. This is consistent with the hypothesis that ketamine increases sensitivity to unexpected sensory input and restores deficits in sensitivity to prediction error that are hypothesised to underlie depression. However, the lack of repetition suppression evident in the MMN evoked data compared to studies of healthy adults suggests that, at least within the short term, ketamine does not improve deficits in adaptive internal model calibration.

In-silico EEG biomarkers of reduced inhibition in human cortical microcircuits in depression.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010986	Reduced cortical inhibition by somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons has been strongly associated with treatment-resistant depression. However, due to technical limitations it is impossible to establish experimentally in humans whether the effects of reduced SST interneuron inhibition on microcircuit activity have signatures detectable in clinically-relevant brain signals such as electroencephalography (EEG). To overcome these limitations, we simulated resting-state activity and EEG using detailed models of human cortical microcircuits with normal (healthy) or reduced SST interneuron inhibition (depression), and found that depression microcircuits exhibited increased theta, alpha and low beta power (4-16 Hz). The changes in depression involved a combination of an aperiodic broadband and periodic theta components. We then demonstrated the specificity of the EEG signatures of reduced SST interneuron inhibition by showing they were distinct from those corresponding to reduced parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneuron inhibition. Our study thus links SST interneuron inhibition level to distinct features in EEG simulated from detailed human microcircuits, which can serve to better identify mechanistic subtypes of depression using EEG, and non-invasively monitor modulation of cortical inhibition.

The somatostatin analogue octreotide impairs sleep and decreases EEG sigma power in young male subjects.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1300298	The long-acting somatostatin (SRIF) analogue octreotide decreased nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) in the rat. This effect is opposite to the promotion of sleep after growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone (GHRH) in various species including humans. Therefore, it appears likely that GHRH and SRIF, besides their opposite action on pituitary GH release, interact reciprocally in sleep regulation. In previous studies, SRIF impaired sleep in elderly subjects, although sleep in young men remained unchanged. We hypothesized that octreotide is a useful tool to study the role of SRIF in human sleep regulation. We examined the effect of subcutaneous administration of 0.1 mg octreotide at 2245 on the sleep EEG of seven young male controls (age, mean+/-SD, 22.3+/-3.0 years). In comparison to placebo, octreotide administration prompted decreases of sleep stage 4 during the total night and of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) density during the first half of the night. Intermittent wakefulness increased during the second half of the night. The spectral analysis of total night NREMS revealed a significant decrease of sigma power. Similar to the effect of the short-acting SRIF in the elderly, the long-acting SRIF analogue octreotide impaired sleep in young healthy subjects. Obviously, the influence of octreotide on sleep is superior to that of short-acting SRIF, which did not affect sleep in young men. We suggest a reciprocal interaction of GHRH and SRIF in sleep regulation.

Genetic mechanisms for impaired synaptic plasticity in schizophrenia revealed by computational modeling.	DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2312511121	Schizophrenia phenotypes are suggestive of impaired cortical plasticity in the disease, but the mechanisms of these deficits are unknown. Genomic association studies have implicated a large number of genes that regulate neuromodulation and plasticity, indicating that the plasticity deficits have a genetic origin. Here, we used biochemically detailed computational modeling of postsynaptic plasticity to investigate how schizophrenia-associated genes regulate long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). We combined our model with data from postmortem RNA expression studies (CommonMind gene-expression datasets) to assess the consequences of altered expression of plasticity-regulating genes for the amplitude of LTP and LTD. Our results show that the expression alterations observed post mortem, especially those in the anterior cingulate cortex, lead to impaired protein kinase A (PKA)-pathway-mediated LTP in synapses containing GluR1 receptors. We validated these findings using a genotyped electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset where polygenic risk scores for synaptic and ion channel-encoding genes as well as modulation of visual evoked potentials were determined for 286 healthy controls. Our results provide a possible genetic mechanism for plasticity impairments in schizophrenia, which can lead to improved understanding and, ultimately, treatment of the disorder.

The effects of AMPA receptor blockade on resting magnetoencephalography recordings.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881117736915	The ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors of the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system are of fundamental importance to healthy brain function. Neuroimaging studies in humans have previously been conducted using various drugs that interact with N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors, but no such studies have investigated AMPA receptor signalling. The recent approval of perampanel (Fycompa) for use in humans provides a means to specifically study the role of AMPA receptors in the pharmacological basis of neuroimaging signals. Twenty male subjects participated in this placebo-controlled crossover study that consisted of two study days separated by a minimum two-week washout period. On one occasion participants ingested a 6 mg dose of perampanel, and on the other a placebo. Ten minutes of wakeful rest was recorded before and after each dose using magnetoencephalography. Subjective ratings of intoxication were significantly higher following drug than placebo. Cluster-based randomisation testing of sensor-level magnetoencephalography data showed significant drug-induced increases in low frequency power (1-4 Hz, 4-8 Hz, 8-13 Hz, 13-30 Hz), along with a significant decrease in the high gamma range (50-90 Hz). We also observed selective increases in functional connectivity in the alpha and beta bands. The findings are consistent with preclinical work and are similar to the spectral profile of other anti-epileptic drugs.

Neurophysiological mechanisms of cortical plasticity impairments in schizophrenia and modulation by the NMDA receptor agonist D-serine.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/aww262	Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in cortical plasticity that affect sensory brain regions and lead to impaired cognitive performance. Here we examined underlying neural mechanisms of auditory plasticity deficits using combined behavioural and neurophysiological assessment, along with neuropharmacological manipulation targeted at the N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptor (NMDAR). Cortical plasticity was assessed in a cohort of 40 schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients relative to 42 healthy control subjects using a fixed reference tone auditory plasticity task. In a second cohort (n = 21 schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients, n = 13 healthy controls), event-related potential and event-related time-frequency measures of auditory dysfunction were assessed during administration of the NMDAR agonist d-serine. Mismatch negativity was used as a functional read-out of auditory-level function. Clinical trials registration numbers were NCT01474395/NCT02156908 Schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients showed significantly reduced auditory plasticity versus healthy controls (P = 0.001) that correlated with measures of cognitive, occupational and social dysfunction. In event-related potential/time-frequency analyses, patients showed highly significant reductions in sensory N1 that reflected underlying impairments in θ responses (P < 0.001), along with reduced θ and β-power modulation during retention and motor-preparation intervals. Repeated administration of d-serine led to intercorrelated improvements in (i) auditory plasticity (P < 0.001); (ii) θ-frequency response (P < 0.05); and (iii) mismatch negativity generation to trained versus untrained tones (P = 0.02). Schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients show highly significant deficits in auditory plasticity that contribute to cognitive, occupational and social dysfunction. d-serine studies suggest first that NMDAR dysfunction may contribute to underlying cortical plasticity deficits and, second, that repeated NMDAR agonist administration may enhance cortical plasticity in schizophrenia.

Electroencephalogram-Driven Machine-Learning Scenario for Assessing Impulse Control Disorder Comorbidity in Parkinson's Disease Using a Low-Cost, Custom LEGO-Like Headset.	DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3323902	Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may develop cognitive symptoms of impulse control disorders (ICDs) when chronically treated with dopamine agonist (DA) therapy for motor deficits. Motor and cognitive comorbidities critically increase the disability and mortality of the affected patients. This study proposes an electroencephalogram (EEG)-driven machine-learning scenario to automatically assess ICD comorbidity in PD. We employed a classic Go/NoGo task to appraise the capacity of cognitive and motoric inhibition with a low-cost, custom LEGO-like headset to record task-relevant EEG activity. Further, we optimized a support vector machine (SVM) and support vector regression (SVR) pipeline to learn discriminative EEG spectral signatures for the detection of ICD comorbidity and the estimation of ICD severity, respectively. With a dataset of 21 subjects with typical PD, 9 subjects with PD and ICD comorbidity (ICD), and 25 healthy controls (HC), the study results showed that the SVM pipeline differentiated subjects with ICD from subjects with PD with an accuracy of 66.3% and returned an around-chance accuracy of 53.3% for the classification of PD versus HC subjects without the comorbidity concern. Furthermore, the SVR pipeline yielded significantly higher severity scores for the ICD group than for the PD group and resembled the ICD vs. PD distinction according to the clinical questionnaire scores, which was barely replicated by random guessing. Without a commercial, high-precision EEG product, our demonstration may facilitate deploying a wearable computer-aided diagnosis system to assess the risk of DA-triggered cognitive comorbidity in patients with PD in their daily environment.

The effect of aging, Parkinson's disease, and exogenous dopamine on the neural response associated with auditory regularity processing.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2020.01.002	Processing regular patterns in auditory scenes is important for navigating complex environments. Electroencephalography studies find enhancement of sustained brain activity, correlating with the emergence of a regular pattern in sounds. How aging, aging-related diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), and treatment of PD with dopaminergic therapy affect this fundamental function remain unknown. We addressed this knowledge gap. Healthy younger and older adults and patients with PD listened to sounds that contained or were devoid of regular patterns. Healthy older adults and patients with PD were tested twice-off and on dopaminergic medication, in counterbalanced order. Regularity-evoked, sustained electroencephalography activity was reduced in older, compared with younger adults. Patients with PD and older controls evidenced comparable attenuation of the sustained response. Dopaminergic therapy further weakened the sustained response in both older controls and patients with PD. These findings suggest that fundamental regularity processing is impacted by aging but not specifically by PD. The finding that dopaminergic therapy attenuates rather than improves the sustained response coheres with the dopamine overdose response and is in line with previous findings that regularity processing implicates brain regions receiving dopamine from the ventral tegmental area that is relatively spared in PD and normal aging.

Diurnal variation of spontaneous eye blink rate in the elderly and its relationships with sleepiness and arousal.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.06.095	Sleep-wake rhythms in the elderly are deeply modified compared to young subjects, irrespective of physical or mental illnesses. However, still controversial are the results about age-related circadian variations of sleepiness levels. The objective of this study is to investigate the profile of diurnal sleepiness in healthy elderly subjects through subjective scales and by measuring spontaneous eye-blink rate (BR). In fact, we have previously found that BR, a reliable and non-invasive peripheral measure of central dopamine activity, increases in the young at times when subjective sleepiness is increased. Twelve healthy elderly volunteers (F=9, M=3, age range 64-79) participated in the experiment. At four times during the day (10a.m., 1.30p.m., 5p.m., 8.30p.m.), Karolinska sleepiness scale and a visual analogue scale for mood were administered to the subjects and BR was measured through vertical EOG. Alpha EEG power was used as objective measure of sleepiness. Sleepiness significantly changes across the day; according to post hoc contrasts, this is due to more sleepiness at 5p.m. Future research should be aimed at clarifying whether this peak is related to phase-advanced core body temperature in elderly people. Differently from the young, no significant differences were found in BR across the day, suggesting that an age-related modification of dopaminergic arousal mechanisms counteracting the rising sleep drive should be further explored.

Dopamine D1, but not D2, signaling protects mental representations from distracting bottom-up influences.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116243	Goal-directed behavior is affected by subliminally and consciously induced conflicts. Both seem to be modulated by catecholamines, especially dopamine. On the basis of cognitive theoretical and neurobiological considerations, we investigated the effects of dopamine D1 and D2 signaling with the help of unweighted polygenic scores in n = 207 healthy young human subjects. We used a task that combines subliminal primes with conscious flankers to induce conflicts. Dopamine D1 scores were formed based on DRD1 rs4532, CALY rs2298122 and TH rs10770141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), while dopamine D2 scores were formed based on DRD2 rs6277 and NPY2R rs2234759 SNPs. We used EEG recordings and source localization analyses to identify differentially modulated neurophysiological sub-processes and functional neuroanatomical structures. Increased dopamine D1 signaling was associated with decreases in consciously induced conflicts. This decrease was due to enhanced stimulus-response mapping in the premotor cortex (BA6), as reflected by an increased P3 amplitude in incongruent trials. Attentional processes remained unaffected by dopamine D1 signaling. The effect of dopamine D2 signaling on conscious conflicts did not reach significance. Subliminally induced conflicts were neither modulated by dopamine D1, nor by dopamine D2 signaling. Our findings suggest that dopamine D1 signaling benefits consciously induced conflicts, presumably by improving the suppression of distracting information via gain control-initiated increases in top-down control processes associated with pre-motor regions. Dopamine D2 signaling does not seem to mediate behavioral differences. Probably, this is because the D2 state facilitates switching between (conflicting) top-down-selected mental representations, but not necessarily between top-down processes and bottom-up distractor information.

Changes of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity during ontogenesis in healthy subjects and in an experimental model (rats).		In children and adolescents (250 healthy subjects) serum dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) activity (23.9+/-5.2 to 57.1+/-17.5 micromol/min/ml) increases with the age between 3-10 years, later it decreases approximately by the age of 10-14 years. At the age of 21 to 60 years DBH level is stable. Our study described decreasing DBH activity in adolescents at the age of 10-14 years in the studied sample of healthy persons. Experimental animals (200 Wistar rats, 5-120 days old) show the same trend of enzymatic activity, similarly as in humans. DBH activity in rats is between 0.85+/-0.1 to 2.8+/-0.05 micromol/min/ml. This activity is highest in 5-day-old rats; it decreases till the age of 14 days and increases mainly in 14- to 35-day-old animals. Decrease of DBH activity in rats between 35 to 40 days is significant and corresponds to the reduction of DBH activity in adolescent humans (10-14 years). Adult rats (aged 90-120 days) show a stable DBH activity. DBH activity intermediately decreases in 10- to 14-year-old children. This decrease corresponds to the intermediate developmental changes of electrophysiological parameters (decreasing EEG activity in healthy adolescents occurs in 10-14 years old children). Puberty is coupled with intermediate decreasing of DBH activity in man and also in experimental animals in the period of prominent psychological and physiological changes.

Mean-field modeling of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical system. II Dynamics of parkinsonian oscillations.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.12.013	Neuronal correlates of Parkinson's disease (PD) include a shift to lower frequencies in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and enhanced synchronized oscillations at 3-7 and 7-30 Hz in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cortex. This study describes the dynamics of a recent physiologically based mean-field model of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical system, and shows how it accounts for many key electrophysiological correlates of PD. Its detailed functional connectivity comprises partially segregated direct and indirect pathways through two populations of striatal neurons, a hyperdirect pathway involving a corticosubthalamic projection, thalamostriatal feedback, and local inhibition in striatum and external pallidum (GPe). In a companion paper, realistic steady-state firing rates were obtained for the healthy state, and after dopamine loss modeled by weaker direct and stronger indirect pathways, reduced intrapallidal inhibition, lower firing thresholds of the GPe and subthalamic nucleus (STN), a stronger projection from striatum to GPe, and weaker cortical interactions. Here it is shown that oscillations around 5 and 20 Hz can arise with a strong indirect pathway, which also causes increased synchronization throughout the basal ganglia. Furthermore, increased theta power with progressive nigrostriatal degeneration is correlated with reduced alpha power and peak frequency, in agreement with empirical results. Unlike the hyperdirect pathway, the indirect pathway sustains oscillations with phase relationships that coincide with those found experimentally. Alterations in the responses of basal ganglia to transient stimuli accord with experimental observations. Reduced cortical gains due to both nigrostriatal and mesocortical dopamine loss lead to slower changes in cortical activity and may be related to bradykinesia. Finally, increased EEG power found in some studies may be partly explained by a lower effective GPe firing threshold, reduced GPe-GPe inhibition, and/or weaker intracortical connections in parkinsonian patients. Strict separation of the direct and indirect pathways is not necessary to obtain these results.

Anticipating social incentives recruits alpha-beta oscillations in the human substantia nigra and invigorates behavior across the life span.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118696	Anticipating social and non-social incentives recruits shared brain structures and promotes behavior. However, little is known about possible age-related behavioral changes, and how the human substantia nigra (SN) signals positive and negative social information. Therefore, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from the SN of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients (n = 12, intraoperative, OFF medication) in combination with a social incentive delay task including photos of neutral, positive or negative human gestures and mimics as feedback. We also tested a group of non-operated PD patients (n = 24, ON and OFF medication), and a sample of healthy young (n = 51) and older (n = 52) adults with behavioral readouts only. Behaviorally, the anticipation of both positive and negative social feedback equally accelerated response times in contrast to neutral social feedback in healthy young and older adults. Although this effect was not significant in the group of operated PD patients - most likely due to the small sample size - iEEG recordings in their SN showed a significant increase in alpha-beta power (9-20 Hz) from 300 to 600 ms after cue onset again for both positive and negative cues. Finally, in non-operated PD patients, the behavioral effect was not modulated by medication status (ON vs OFF medication) suggesting that other processes than dopaminergic neuromodulation play a role in driving invigoration by social incentives. Together, our findings provide novel and direct evidence for a role of the SN in processing positive and negative social information via specific oscillatory mechanisms in the alpha-beta range, and they suggest that anticipating social value in simple cue-outcome associations is intact in healthy aging and PD.

The feedback-related negativity (FRN) revisited: new insights into the localization, meaning and network organization.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.08.028	Changes in response contingencies require adjusting ones assumptions about outcomes of behaviors. Such adaptation processes are driven by reward prediction error (RPE) signals which reflect the inadequacy of expectations. Signals resembling RPEs are known to be encoded by mesencephalic dopamine neurons projecting to the striatum and frontal regions. Although regions that process RPEs, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), have been identified, only indirect evidence links timing and network organization of RPE processing in humans. In electroencephalography (EEG), which is well known for its high temporal resolution, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) has been suggested to reflect RPE processing. Recent studies, however, suggested that the FRN might reflect surprise, which would correspond to the absolute, rather than the signed RPE signals. Furthermore, the localization of the FRN remains a matter of debate. In this simultaneous EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we localized the FRN directly using the superior spatial resolution of fMRI without relying on any spatial constraint or other assumption. Using two different single-trial approaches, we consistently found a cluster within the dACC. One analysis revealed additional activations of the salience network. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of signed RPEs and surprise signals on the FRN amplitude. We considered that both signals are usually correlated and found that only surprise signals modulate the FRN amplitude. Last, we explored the pathway of RPE signals using dynamic causal modeling (DCM). We found that the surprise signals are directly projected to the source region of the FRN. This finding contradicts earlier theories about the network organization of the FRN, but is in line with a recent theory stating that dopamine neurons also encode surprise-like saliency signals. Our findings crucially advance the understanding of the FRN. We found compelling evidence that the FRN originates from the dACC. Furthermore, we clarified the functional role of the FRN, and determined the role of the dACC within the RPE network. These findings should enable us to study the processing of surprise and adjustment signals in the dACC in healthy and also in psychiatric patients.

Event-related potentials reflect impaired temporal interval learning following haloperidol administration.	DOI: 10.1007/s00213-017-4645-2	Signals carried by the mesencephalic dopamine system and conveyed to anterior cingulate cortex are critically implicated in probabilistic reward learning and performance monitoring. A common evaluative mechanism purportedly subserves both functions, giving rise to homologous medial frontal negativities in feedback- and response-locked event-related brain potentials (the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the error-related negativity (ERN), respectively), reflecting dopamine-dependent prediction error signals to unexpectedly negative events. Consistent with this model, the dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol, attenuates the ERN, but effects on FRN have not yet been evaluated.

Event-related potentials in performance monitoring are influenced by the endogenous opioid system.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.08.028	Recent research suggests that not only the dopamine neurotransmitter system but also the endogenous opioid system is involved in performance monitoring and the generation of prediction error signals. Heightened performance monitoring is also associated with psychopathology such as internalizing disorders. Therefore, the current study investigated the potential link between the functional opioid peptide prodynorphin (PDYN) 68 bp VNTR genetic polymorphism and neuronal correlates of performance monitoring. To this end, 47 healthy participants genotyped for this polymorphism, related to high-, intermediate-, and low-expression levels of PDYN, performed a choice-reaction task while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. On the behavioural level, no differences between the three PDYN groups could be observed. EEG data, however, showed significant differences. High PDYN expression individuals showed heightened neural error processing indicated by higher ERN amplitudes, compared to intermediate and low expression individuals. Later stages of error processing, indexed by late Pe amplitudes, and stimulus-driven conflict processing, indexed by N2 amplitudes, were not affected by PDYN genotype. The current results corroborate the notion of an indirect effect of endogenous opioids on performance monitoring, probably mediated by the mesencephalic dopamine system. Overall, enhanced ERN amplitudes suggest a hyper-active performance monitoring system in high PDYN expression individuals, and this might also be an indicator of a higher risk for internalizing disorders.

The use of diurnal vigilance changes in the EEG to verify vigilance-enhancing effects of memantine in a clinical pharmacological study.	DOI: 10.1159/000119246	In elderly subjects there is a vigilance decrease from morning to noon which was used in a clinical pharmacological model as a state condition to verify vigilance-enhancing effects of an antidementia drug. In this model the effects of Memantine (20 mg, single-dose application) on the quantified EEG were investigated in 16 elderly (mean age: 65 +/- 5 years), healthy subjects (10 females, 6 males) in a randomised, twofold cross-over design vs. placebo under double-blind conditions. EEG was recorded before medication, and 2 and 4 h after medication under reaction time (RT) and resting (RS) conditions. EEG data were subjected to spectral analysis and the topographic distribution of the amplitude values was mapped. The results show that a time-dependent decrease (from morning to noon) in vigilance (indicated by an increase in average EEG amplitudes caused by increased synchronisation in the alpha and beta range and an increase in delta) occurred under placebo which was counteracted by Memantine. The diurnal variations of the EEG and their compensation by a pharmacological agent represent an effective model for investigating the vigilance-enhancing effects of antidementia drugs.

Gossip information increases reward-related oscillatory activity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116520	Previous research has described the process by which the interaction between the firing in midbrain dopamine neurons and the hippocampus results in promoting memory for high-value motivational and rewarding events, both extrinsically and intrinsically driven (i.e. curiosity). Studies on social cognition and gossip have also revealed the activation of similar areas from the reward network. In this study we wanted to assess the electrophysiological correlates of the anticipation and processing of novel information (as an intrinsic cognitive reward) depending on the degree of elicited curiosity and the content of the information. 24 healthy volunteers participated in this EEG experiment. The task consisted of 150 questions and answers divided into three different conditions: trivia-like questions, personal-gossip information about celebrities and personal-neutral information about the same celebrities. Our main results from the ERPs and time-frequency analysis pinpointed main differences for gossip in comparison with personal-neutral and trivia-like conditions. Specifically, we found an increase in beta oscillatory activity in the outcome phase and a decrease of the same frequency band in the expectation phase. Larger amplitudes in P300 component were also found for gossip condition. Finally, gossip answers were the most remembered in a one-week memory test. The arousing value and saliency of gossip information, its rewarding effect evidenced by the increase of beta oscillatory power and the recruitment of areas from the brain reward network in previous fMRI studies, as well as its potential social value have been argued in order to explain its differential processing, encoding and recall.

Effect of the dopamine D2 antagonist sulpiride on event-related potentials and its relation to the law of initial value.	DOI: 10.1016/0167-8760(94)90046-9	Effects of the dopamine antagonist sulpiride on event-related potentials (ERPs) were investigated during an auditory odd ball task in 18 healthy volunteers. Sulpiride (150 or 300 mg) or an inactive placebo was administered according to a completely randomized double-blind cross-over design. ERPs were recorded 1 h after medication was given. Sulpiride shortened the P200 latency for frequent stimuli, but tended to increase the N200 and P300 latencies for rare stimuli. Although on the whole sulpiride had no effect on the amplitudes of the ERP components in the subjects, it increased the P300 amplitudes in the low P300 amplitude subjects and decreased them in the high P300 amplitude subjects. This tendency for a bidirectional response was also found for the N100 and N200 amplitudes. A single administration of 150 or 300 mg sulpiride is considered to affect the ERP latencies and amplitudes in healthy subjects, the bidirectional response that takes place being dependent on the difference in the initial values. The results of this study are discussed in relation to the 'Law of initial value'.

A framework for quantifying the coupling between brain connectivity and heartbeat dynamics: Insights into the disrupted network physiology in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.26668	Parkinson's disease (PD) often shows disrupted brain connectivity and autonomic dysfunctions, progressing alongside with motor and cognitive decline. Recently, PD has been linked to a reduced sensitivity to cardiac inputs, that is, cardiac interoception. Altogether, those signs suggest that PD causes an altered brain-heart connection whose mechanisms remain unclear. Our study aimed to explore the large-scale network disruptions and the neurophysiology of disrupted interoceptive mechanisms in PD. We focused on examining the alterations in brain-heart coupling in PD and their potential connection to motor symptoms. We developed a proof-of-concept method to quantify relationships between the co-fluctuations of brain connectivity and cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. We quantified the brain-heart couplings from electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram recordings from PD patients on and off dopaminergic medication, as well as in healthy individuals at rest. Our results show that the couplings of fluctuating alpha and gamma connectivity with cardiac sympathetic dynamics are reduced in PD patients, as compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, we show that PD patients under dopamine medication recover part of the brain-heart coupling, in proportion with the reduced motor symptoms. Our proposal offers a promising approach to unveil the physiopathology of PD and promoting the development of new evaluation methods for the early stages of the disease.

A topographic event-related potential follow-up study on 'prepulse inhibition' in first and second episode patients with schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/s0925-4927(98)00053-5	Dopamine agonists impair and antagonists normalize prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle and gating of the P50 event-related potential (ERP), but the within-subject effect of treatment on impaired gating in schizophrenia has not been studied. We report the first results of a longitudinal study using PPI of ERPs as a measure of sensory gating in an auditory Go/NoGo discrimination. After admission and approximately 3 months later, at discharge, 15 patients with schizophrenia performed a discrimination between a 1.4 kHz target tone and an 0.8 kHz non-target tone with no prepulse, or with a prepulse at 100 ms or 500 ms before either tone. ERPs were recorded from 19 sites. Healthy subjects were studied twice, with 3 months between sessions. PPI of the P50 peak in the 100-ms condition was reduced in patients on admission. At discharge, decreased negative symptoms correlated with enhanced P50-PPI at frontocentral sites. After treatment increased N100-PPI at centrotemporal sites correlated with fewer positive symptoms. At frontal sites in the 100-ms condition, the initially small difference of non-target minus target P300 amplitudes increased as negative symptoms decreased. It is concluded that weak auditory prepulses interfere with early auditory stimulus processing (P50), channel selection (N100) and selective attention (P300). Gating of these stages of processing is impaired in psychotic patients and treatment tends to normalize gating in tandem with improvements of different types of symptoms.

Dopaminergic modulation of novelty repetition in Parkinson's disease: A study of P3 event-related brain potentials.

Patients show reduced novelty P3 (nP3) amplitudes in oddball experiments, a response to infrequent, surprising stimuli, linked to the orienting response of the brain.

Expectancy affects the feedback-related negativity (FRN) for delayed feedback in probabilistic learning.	DOI: 10.1111/psyp.12738	Learning from feedback is a prerequisite for adapting to the environment. Prediction error signals coded by midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are projected to the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). It has been suggested that neuronal activity shifts away from the DA system when feedback is delayed. The feedback-related negativity (FRN), an ERP that is generated in the ACC and has been shown to be sensitive to feedback valence and prediction error magnitude, was found to be reduced for delayed feedback. It has, however, not yet been investigated if the FRN for delayed feedback reflects a reward prediction error. In this study, effects of feedback delay (1 s vs. 7 s) on the processing of expected and unexpected positive and negative feedback were investigated in a between-subjects design in healthy human participants conducting a probabilistic feedback learning task. FRN and P300 amplitudes were decreased for subjects learning from delayed compared to immediate feedback. Importantly, the FRN, extracted from the negative-positive feedback difference wave, was significantly smaller for expected compared to unexpected feedback for both the immediate and delayed feedback conditions. Expectancy effects for the P300 were also seen, but did not interact with feedback valence. These results demonstrate an influence of feedback expectancy, and thus the prediction error, on early feedback processing even for delayed feedback, suggesting that neuronal structures underlying feedback processing are comparable for immediate and delayed feedback, at least to some extent. Modulations of the P300 by feedback delay may be linked to feedback salience.

High-dose alcohol intoxication differentially modulates cognitive subprocesses involved in response inhibition.	DOI: 10.1111/adb.12170	Aside from well-known physiological effects, high-dose alcohol intoxication (a.k.a. binge drinking) can lead to aversive social and legal consequences because response inhibition is usually compromised under the influence of alcohol. Although the behavioral aspects of this phenomenon were reported on extensively, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms mediating this disinhibition are unclear. To close this gap, we used both behavioral and neurophysiological measures (event-related potentials, ERPs) to investigate which subprocesses of response inhibition are altered under the influence of high-dose alcohol intoxication. Using a within-subject design, we asked young healthy participants (n = 27) to complete a GO/NOGO task once sober and once intoxicated (approximately 1.2‰). During intoxication, high-dose alcohol effects were highest in a condition where the participants could not rely on automated stimulus-response mapping processes during response inhibition. In this context, the NOGO-P3 (ERP), that likely depends on dopaminergic signaling within mesocorticolimbic pathways and is thought to reflect motor inhibition and/or the evaluation of inhibitory processes, was altered in the intoxicated state. In contrast to this, the N2 component, which largely depends on nigrostriatal dopamine pathways and is thought to reflect inhibition on a pre-motor level, was not altered. Based on these results, we demonstrate that alcohol-induced changes of dopaminergic neurotransmission do not exert a global effect on response inhibition. Instead, changes are highly subprocess-specific and seem to mainly target mesocorticolimbic pathways that contribute to motor inhibition and the evaluation of such.

Is prepulse modification altered by continuous theta burst stimulation? DAT1 genotype and motor threshold interact on prepulse modification following brain stimulation.	DOI: 10.1007/s00406-017-0786-x	Previous studies suggest an inhibitory top-down control of the amygdala by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Both brain regions play a role in the modulation of prepulse modification (PPM) of the acoustic startle response by a pre-stimulus. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can modulate the activity of the PFC and might thus affect PPM. This study tested the effect of inhibitory rTMS on PPM accounting for a genetic variant of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1). Healthy participants (N = 102) were stimulated with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS, an intense form of inhibitory rTMS) or sham treatment over the right PFC. Afterwards, during continuous presentation of a background white noise a louder noise burst was presented either alone (control startle) or preceded by a prepulse. Participants were genotyped for a DAT1 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism. Two succeeding sessions of cTBS over the right PFC (2 × 600 stimuli with a time lag of 15 min) attenuated averaged prepulse inhibition (PPI) in participants with a high resting motor threshold. An attenuation of PPI induced by prepulses with great distances to the pulse (480, 2000 ms) was observed following active cTBS in participants that were homozygous carriers of the 10-repeat-allele of the DAT1 genotype and had a high resting motor threshold. Our results confirm the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the modulation of PPM. The effects were observed in participants with a high resting motor threshold only, probably because they received a higher dose of cTBS. The effects in homozygous carriers of the DAT1 10-repeat allele confirm the relevance of dopamine for PPM. Conducting an exploratory study we decided against the use of a correction for multiple testing.

Dopaminergic treatment modulates sensory attenuation at the onset of the movement in Parkinson's disease: A test of a new framework for bradykinesia.	DOI: 10.1002/mds.26493	The primary motor sign of Parkinson's disease is bradykinesia. It has been surprisingly difficult to provide a clear neurobiological mechanism for this fundamental movement deficit in Parkinson's disease. It has been proposed that in healthy individuals the gating of sensory afferents prior to and during movement is an essential step in initiating movement. This down-weighting has been proposed to account for the attenuation of the somatosensory evoked potential following median nerve stimulation at the onset of and during hand movements. The objective of this study was to test whether this sensory attenuation present at movement onset in healthy controls is present in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Alterations of oscillatory neuronal activity during reward processing in schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.05.031	Reward system dysfunctions are considered to be a pathophysiological mechanism in schizophrenia. Electrophysiological studies of reward system functions have identified frequency-specific brain networks for the processing of positive (high-beta frequency) and negative (theta frequency) events. Remarkably, midbrain dopaminergic signalling also includes theta and high-beta frequency modes, which have been assumed to reflect tonic and phasic dopamine responses, respectively. The aim of the present study was to identify alterations of oscillatory responses to reward feedback in patients with schizophrenia.

Abnormal salience signaling in schizophrenia: The role of integrative beta oscillations.	DOI: 10.1002/hbm.23107	Aberrant salience attribution and cerebral dysconnectivity both have strong evidential support as core dysfunctions in schizophrenia. Aberrant salience arising from an excess of dopamine activity has been implicated in delusions and hallucinations, exaggerating the significance of everyday occurrences and thus leading to perceptual distortions and delusional causal inferences. Meanwhile, abnormalities in key nodes of a salience brain network have been implicated in other characteristic symptoms, including the disorganization and impoverishment of mental activity. A substantial body of literature reports disruption to brain network connectivity in schizophrenia. Electrical oscillations likely play a key role in the coordination of brain activity at spatially remote sites, and evidence implicates beta band oscillations in long-range integrative processes. We used magnetoencephalography and a task designed to disambiguate responses to relevant from irrelevant stimuli to investigate beta oscillations in nodes of a network implicated in salience detection and previously shown to be structurally and functionally abnormal in schizophrenia. Healthy participants, as expected, produced an enhanced beta synchronization to behaviorally relevant, as compared to irrelevant, stimuli, while patients with schizophrenia showed the reverse pattern: a greater beta synchronization in response to irrelevant than to relevant stimuli. These findings not only support both the aberrant salience and disconnectivity hypotheses, but indicate a common mechanism that allows us to integrate them into a single framework for understanding schizophrenia in terms of disrupted recruitment of contextually appropriate brain networks.

The influence of anhedonia on feedback negativity in major depressive disorder.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.11.023	Anhedonia is associated with reward-processing deficits of the dopamine system, which may increase the risk of depression. Nevertheless, few previous studies have examined the influence of hedonic tone on event-related potential (ERP) measures of reward processing in major depressive disorder. A simple gambling task was used to elicit feedback negativity (FN), an ERP component elicited by feedback indicating gain versus loss, in 27 patients with major depression and 27 healthy participants. We found that participants with depression were characterized by reduced FN responses, especially towards monetary gains, but not losses, compared with healthy individuals. In addition, the amplitude of FN to gain feedback in participants with depression was related to anhedonia severity and depressive symptoms. These findings indicate an association between low hedonic capacity and reduction in FN. As a neural measure of reward sensitivity, FN may be generated in part by reward-related activity.

Effects of 50mg amisulpride on EEG, psychomotor and cognitive functions in healthy sleep-deprived subjects.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1472-8206.1999.tb00365.x	Amisulpride, a substituted benzamide, binds selectively to the dopamine D2- and D3-receptors. It has higher affinity for limbic compared to striatal dopamine receptors in vivo. At low doses, amisulpride facilitates dopamine transmission via a selective blockade of presynaptic D2- and D3-receptors. Amisulpride is an active antipsychotic compound effective at low doses for negative symptoms and at high doses for positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The CNS profile of multiple doses of a low dosage regimen of amisulpride (50 mg once daily for 4 days) was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, 3-way crossover, placebo-controlled study carried out in 12 young sleep-deprived (for 36 h) subjects, using EEG and various measures of psychomotor and cognitive functions. Caffeine slow release (600 mg) was used as a positive reference. Multiple doses of 50 mg amisulpride once daily were devoid of any detrimental effects on EEG and psychomotor performance and cognitive function after total sleep deprivation. In addition, 50mg amisulpride partially antagonized the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation on EEG and subjective sedation as shown by trends, and a significant increase in EEG relative beta power and a decrease in subjective sedation. These effects were more pronounced at the end of sleep deprivation, suggesting possible alerting effects of amisulpride at this dose level. Caffeine significantly antagonized the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation on vigilance (increase in EEG beta waves, speed of reaction, sustained attention and reduction in subjective sedation). In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that 50 mg amisulpride is devoid of detrimental effects on EEG, psychomotor and cognitive performance after sleep deprivation, a situation well-known to amplify such effects if they exist. Moreover, some data suggest possible alerting effects of this low dosage regimen of amisulpride.

Separating the aperiodic and periodic components of neural activity in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1111/ejn.15774	Most studies on electrophysiology have not separated aperiodic activity from the spectra but have rather evaluated a combined periodic oscillatory component and the aperiodic component. As the understanding of aperiodic activity gradually deepens, its potential physiological significance has acquired increased appreciation. Herein, we investigated the two components in scalp electroencephalogram in 16 healthy controls and 15 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD); the results revealed that aperiodic parameters were approximately symmetrically distributed in topography in patients with PD and were significantly modulated by dopaminergic medication in channels C4, C3, CP5 and FC5. In sum, our findings might provide indicators for evaluating treatment response in PD and highlight the importance of re-evaluating the neuronal power spectra parameterization.

Evidence for enhanced multi-component behaviour in Tourette syndrome - an EEG study.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-08158-9	Evidence suggests that Tourette syndrome is characterized by an increase in dopamine transmission and structural as well as functional changes in fronto-striatal circuits that might lead to enhanced multi-component behaviour integration. Behavioural and neurophysiological data regarding multi-component behaviour was collected from 15 patients with Tourette syndrome (mean age = 30.40 ± 11.10) and 15 healthy controls (27.07 ± 5.44), using the stop-change task. In this task, participants are asked to sometimes withhold responses to a Go stimulus (stop cue) and change hands to respond to an alternative Go stimulus (change cue). Different onset asynchronies between stop and change cues were implemented (0 and 300 ms) in order to vary task difficulty. Tourette patients responded more accurately than healthy controls when there was no delay between stop and change stimulus, while there was no difference in the 300 ms delay condition. This performance advantage was reflected in a smaller P3 event related potential. Enhanced multi-component behaviour in Tourette syndrome is likely based on an enhanced ability to integrate information from multiple sources and translate it into an appropriate response sequence.

Subthalamic nucleus stimulation and somatosensory temporal discrimination in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1093/brain/awq191	Whereas numerous studies document the effects of dopamine medication and deep brain stimulation on motor function in patients with Parkinson's disease, few have investigated deep brain stimulation-induced changes in sensory functions. In this study of 13 patients with Parkinson's disease, we tested the effects of deep brain stimulation on the somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold. To investigate whether deep brain stimulation and dopaminergic medication induce similar changes in somatosensory discrimination, somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold values were acquired under four experimental conditions: (i) medication ON/deep brain stimulation on; (ii) medication ON/deep brain stimulation off; (iii) medication OFF/deep brain stimulation on; and (iv) medication OFF/deep brain stimulation off. Patients also underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluations during each experimental session. Somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold values obtained in patients were compared with 13 age-matched healthy subjects. Somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold values were significantly higher in patients than in healthy subjects. In patients, somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold values were significantly lower when patients were studied in medication ON than in medication OFF conditions. Somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold values differed significantly between deep brain stimulation on and deep brain stimulation off conditions only when the patients were studied in the medication ON condition and were higher in the deep brain stimulation on/medication ON than in the deep brain stimulation off/medication ON condition. Dopamine but not subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation restores the altered somatosensory temporal discrimination in patients with Parkinson's disease. Deep brain stimulation degrades somatosensory temporal discrimination by modifying central somatosensory processing whereas dopamine restores the interplay between cortical and subcortical structures.

Feelings of helplessness increase ERN amplitudes in healthy individuals.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.12.008	Experiencing feelings of helplessness has repeatedly been reported to contribute to depressive symptoms and negative affect. In turn, depression and negative affective states are associated, among others, with impairments in performance monitoring. Thus, the question arises whether performance monitoring is also affected by feelings of helplessness. To this end, after the induction of feelings of helplessness via an unsolvable reasoning task, 37 participants (20 females) performed a modified version of a Flanker task. Based on a previously validated questionnaire, 17 participants were classified as helpless and 20 as not-helpless. Behavioral measures revealed no differences between helpless and not-helpless individuals. However, we observed enhanced Error-Related Negativity (ERN) amplitude differences between erroneous and correct responses in the helpless compared to the not-helpless group. Furthermore, correlational analysis revealed that higher scores of helplessness were associated with increased ERN difference scores. No influence of feelings of helplessness on later stages of performance monitoring was observed as indicated by Error-Positivity (Pe) amplitude. The present study is the first to demonstrate that feelings of helplessness modulate the neuronal correlates of performance monitoring. Thus, even a short-lasting subjective state manipulation can lead to ERN amplitude variation, probably via modulation of mesencephalic dopamine activity.

Positive emotion modulates cognitive control: an event-related potentials study.	DOI: 10.1111/sjop.12031	There is substantial evidence to indicate that negative emotion can modulate cognitive control processing. However, only a few studies have investigated this effect with positive emotion. Therefore, the present study explored the electrophysiological correlates of the impact of positive emotional stimuli on cognitive control, using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixteen healthy young adults completed a modified Simon task (Simon, 1969). Behavioral data indicated that reaction times were faster for positive emotional stimuli than for neutral emotional stimuli in the incongruent condition, but not in the congruent condition, which suggested that positive emotion expedited conflict resolution. The ERP data showed that two negative ERP components (N300-400 and N450-550) were associated with the positive emotional stimuli in the incongruent minus congruent condition. It is suggested that these components may respectively be related to the conflict monitoring (N300-400) and response selection (N450-550) stages of cognitive control processing. Overall, our results indicated that positive emotion could facilitate cognitive control processing. These results are in line with the neuropsychological theory, according to which, positive emotion could modulate cognitive control mediated by increased dopamine levels in frontal brain areas.

Electrophysiological resting state networks of predominantly akinetic-rigid Parkinson patients: Effects of dopamine therapy.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nicl.2019.102147	Parkinson's disease (PD) causes both motor and non-motor symptoms, which can partially be reversed by dopamine therapy. These symptoms as well as the effect of dopamine may be explained by distinct alterations in whole-brain architecture. We used functional connectivity (FC) and in particular resting state network (RSN) analysis to identify such whole-brain alterations in a frequency-specific manner. In addition, we hypothesized that standard dopaminergic medication would have a normalizing effect on these whole brain alterations. We recorded resting-state EEGs of 19 PD patients in the medical OFF and ON states, and of 12 healthy age-matched controls. The PD patients were either of akinetic-rigid or mixed subtype. We extracted RSNs with independent component analysis in the source space for five frequency bands. Within the sensorimotor network (SMN) the supplementary motor area (SMA) showed decreased FC in the OFF state compared to healthy controls. This finding was reversed after dopamine administration. Furthermore, in the OFF state no stable SMN beta component could be identified. The default mode network showed alterations due to PD independent of the medication state. The visual network was altered in the OFF state, and reinstated to a pattern similar to healthy controls by medication. In conclusion, PD causes distinct RSN alterations, which are partly reversed after levodopa administration. The changes within the SMN are of particular interest, because they broaden the pathophysiological understanding of PD. Our results identify the SMA as a central network hub affected in PD and a crucial effector of dopamine therapy.

Haloperidol counteracts the ketamine-induced disruption of processing negativity, but not that of the P300 amplitude.	DOI: 10.1017/S1461145708009814	Antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors such as ketamine, induce abnormalities in healthy subjects similar to those found in schizophrenia. However, recent evidence, suggests that most of the currently known NMDA antagonists have a broader receptor profile than originally thought. Besides exerting an antagonistic effect on NMDA receptors, they have agonistic effects on dopamine D2 receptors. Can haloperidol (D2 antagonist) counteract the disruptive effects of ketamine on psychophysiological parameters of human attention? In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment 18 healthy male volunteers received placebo/placebo, placebo/ketamine (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) and haloperidol (2 mg)/ketamine (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) on three separate test days, after which they were tested in an auditory selective-attention paradigm. Haloperidol/ketamine reduced task performance compared to placebo/placebo, while the task performance in these two treatments did not differ from placebo/ketamine. Furthermore, placebo/ketamine reduced processing negativity compared to both placebo/placebo and haloperidol/ketamine, while processing negativity did not differ between placebo/placebo and haloperidol/ketamine treatments. However, both placebo/ketamine and haloperidol/ketamine reduced P300 amplitude compared to placebo/placebo, while P300 amplitude did not differ between placebo/ketamine and haloperidol/ketamine treatments. The combined effects of haloperidol and ketamine reduced task performance, suggesting that this is dependent on dopaminergic D2 activity, probably in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, ketamine reduced both P300 amplitude and processing negativity. In contrast to the P300 amplitude, the disruptive effects of ketamine on processing negativity could be prevented by pretreatment with haloperidol. The current results suggest that ketamine reduced P300 amplitude by its antagonistic effect on glutamatergic activity, while it reduced processing negativity by its agonistic effect on dopaminergic D2 activity.

Dopaminergic medication alters auditory distractor processing in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1016/j.actpsy.2015.02.001	Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show signs of cognitive impairment, such as executive dysfunction, working memory problems and attentional disturbances, even in the early stages of the disease. Though motor symptoms of the disease are often successfully addressed by dopaminergic medication, it still remains unclear, how dopaminergic therapy affects cognitive function. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of dopaminergic medication on visual and auditory attentional processing. 14 PD patients and 13 matched healthy controls performed a three-stimulus auditory and visual oddball task while their EEG was recorded. The patients performed the task twice, once on- and once off-medication. While the results showed no significant differences between PD patients and controls, they did reveal a significant increase in P3 amplitude on- vs. off-medication specific to processing of auditory distractors and no other stimuli. These results indicate significant effect of dopaminergic therapy on processing of distracting auditory stimuli. With a lack of between group differences the effect could reflect either 1) improved recruitment of attentional resources to auditory distractors; 2) reduced ability for cognitive inhibition of auditory distractors; 3) increased response to distractor stimuli resulting in impaired cognitive performance; or 4) hindered ability to discriminate between auditory distractors and targets. Further studies are needed to differentiate between these possibilities.

Impact of early life adversity on reward processing in young adults: EEG-fMRI results from a prospective study over 25 years.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0104185	Several lines of evidence have implicated the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway in altered brain function resulting from exposure to early adversity. The present study examined the impact of early life adversity on different stages of neuronal reward processing later in life and their association with a related behavioral phenotype, i.e. attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 162 healthy young adults (mean age = 24.4 years; 58% female) from an epidemiological cohort study followed since birth participated in a simultaneous EEG-fMRI study using a monetary incentive delay task. Early life adversity according to an early family adversity index (EFA) and lifetime ADHD symptoms were assessed using standardized parent interviews conducted at the offspring's age of 3 months and between 2 and 15 years, respectively. fMRI region-of-interest analysis revealed a significant effect of EFA during reward anticipation in reward-related areas (i.e. ventral striatum, putamen, thalamus), indicating decreased activation when EFA increased. EEG analysis demonstrated a similar effect for the contingent negative variation (CNV), with the CNV decreasing with the level of EFA. In contrast, during reward delivery, activation of the bilateral insula, right pallidum and bilateral putamen increased with EFA. There was a significant association of lifetime ADHD symptoms with lower activation in the left ventral striatum during reward anticipation and higher activation in the right insula during reward delivery. The present findings indicate a differential long-term impact of early life adversity on reward processing, implicating hyporesponsiveness during reward anticipation and hyperresponsiveness when receiving a reward. Moreover, a similar activation pattern related to lifetime ADHD suggests that the impact of early life stress on ADHD may possibly be mediated by a dysfunctional reward pathway.

Haloperidol impairs learning and error-related negativity in humans.	DOI: 10.1162/0898929041502779	Humans are able to monitor their actions for behavioral conflicts and performance errors. Growing evidence suggests that the error-related negativity (ERN) of the event-related cortical brain potential (ERP) may index the functioning of this response monitoring system and that the ERN may depend on dopaminergic mechanisms. We examined the role of dopamine in ERN and behavioral indices of learning by administering either 3 mg of the dopamine antagonist (DA) haloperidol (n = 17); 25 mg of diphenhydramine (n = 16), which has a similar CNS profile but without DA properties; or placebo (n = 18) in a randomized, double-blind manner to healthy volunteers. Three hours after drug administration, participants performed a go/no-go Continuous Performance Task, the Eriksen Flanker Task, and a learning-dependent Time Estimation Task. Haloperidol significantly attenuated ERN amplitudes recorded during the flanker task, impaired learning of time intervals, and tended to cause more errors of commission, compared to placebo, which did not significantly differ from diphenhydramine. Drugs had no significant effects on the stimulus-locked P1 and N2 ERPs or on behavioral response latencies, but tended to affect post-error reaction time (RT) latencies in opposite ways (haloperidol decreased and diphenhydramine increased RTs). These findings support the hypothesis that the DA system is involved in learning and the generation of the ERN.

Increased conflict-induced slowing, but no differences in conflict-induced positive or negative prediction error learning in patients with schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.04.031	People with schizophrenia (PSZ) often fail to pursue rewarding activities despite largely intact in-the-moment hedonic experiences. Deficits in effort-based decision making in PSZ may be related to enhanced effects of cost or reduced reward, i.e., through the amplification of negative prediction errors or by dampened positive prediction errors (here, positive and negative prediction errors refer to outcomes that are better or worse than expected respectively). We administered a modified Simon task to people with schizophrenia (PSZ; N = 46) and healthy controls (N = 32). The modification included a reinforcement learning component, where positive and negative prediction errors are dampened or boosted through the use of cognitively-effortful response conflict. EEG was recorded concurrently to investigate potential differences in conflict enhanced mid-frontal theta power between PSZ and controls. We found an enhanced effect of response conflict on response time in people with schizophrenia, but no discernible difference in conflict processing as reflected by the lack of a difference in theta-power enhancement to conflict in mid-frontal regions. Using the reinforcement learning transfer phase of the modified Simon task, PSZ also showed clear deficits in selecting the most rewarding stimulus during the 'easy' (most discriminable in terms of value) stimulus contrasts. However, we failed to find a difference between patients and controls in their gain or avoidance learning bias, nor did these biases correlate with negative symptoms. Previous studies had failed to find significant conflict effects on the Simon task likely due to its modest effect size. Our results show that PSZ do indeed possess subtle impairments in response-conflict, suggesting an increase in cognitive effort required for appropriate responding. In addition, while the lack of an overt positive or negative prediction error bias (i.e., a bias towards punishment or reward learning) was unexpected, it is consistent with recent work showing intact estimation of value when the reinforcement learning system is isolated from other contributors to value learning.

Novelty processing and memory formation in Parkinson's disease.

Conflict processing in juvenile patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and healthy controls - Two pathways to success.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nicl.2017.02.014	Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a monogenetic autosomal-dominant disorder with a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms and is commonly associated with cognitive deficits. Patients with NF1 frequently exhibit cognitive impairments like attention problems, working memory deficits and dysfunctional inhibitory control. The latter is also relevant for the resolution of cognitive conflicts. However, it is unclear how conflict monitoring processes are modulated in NF1. To examine this question in more detail, we used a system neurophysiological approach combining high-density ERP recordings with source localisation analyses in juvenile patients with NF1 and controls during a flanker task. Behaviourally, patients with NF1 perform significantly slower than controls. Specifically on trials with incompatible flanker-target pairings, however, the patients with NF1 made significantly fewer errors than healthy controls. Yet, importantly, this overall successful conflict resolution was reached via two different routes in the two groups. The healthy controls seem to arrive at a successful conflict monitoring performance through a developing conflict recognition via the N2 accompanied by a selectively enhanced N450 activation in the case of perceived flanker-target conflicts. The presumed dopamine deficiency in the patients with NF1 seems to result in a reduced ability to process conflicts via the N2. However, NF1 patients show an increased N450 irrespective of cognitive conflict. Activation differences in the orbitofrontal cortex (BA11) and anterior cingulate cortex (BA24) underlie these modulations. Taken together, juvenile patients with NF1 and juvenile healthy controls seem to accomplish conflict monitoring via two different cognitive neurophysiological pathways.

Effects of haloperidol on selective attention: a combined whole-head MEG and high-resolution EEG study.	DOI: 10.1016/S0893-133X(01)00255-X	We used 122-channel magnetoencephalography (MEG) and 64-channel electroencephalogrphy (EEG) simultaneously to study the effects of dopaminergic transmission on human selective attention in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design. A single dose of dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (2 mg) or placebo was given orally to 12 right-handed healthy volunteers 3 hours before measurement. In a dichotic selective attention task, subjects were presented with two trains of standard (700 Hz to the left ear, 1,100 Hz to the right ear) and deviant (770 and 1,210 Hz, respectively) tones. Subjects were instructed to count the tones presented to one ear; whereas, the tones presented to the other ear were to be ignored. Haloperidol significantly attenuated processing negativity (PN), an event-related potential (ERP) component elicited by selectively attended standard tones at 300-500 ms after stimulus presentation. These results, indicating impaired selective attention by a blockade of dopamine D2 receptors, were further accompanied with increased mismatch negativity (MMN), elicited by involuntary detection of task-irrelevant deviants. Taken together, haloperidol seemed to induce functional changes in neural networks accounting for both selective and involuntary attention, suggesting modulation of these functions by dopamine D2 receptors.

DRD1 and DRD2 genotypes modulate processing modes of goal activation processes during action cascading.	DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5140-13.2014	Dopamine plays an important role in action selection, but little is known about the influence of different dopamine receptor systems on the subprocesses occurring during the cascading of actions. Because action selection and cascading can be accomplished in a serial manner or a parallel manner, we investigated the potential effects of DRD1 (rs4531) and DRD2 (rs6277) receptor polymorphisms on this dimension. We gathered behavioral and neurophysiological data from healthy human subjects (n = 162) and applied mathematical constraints to quantify their action selection strategy on a serial-parallel continuum. The behavioral results show a more serial and more effective action cascading strategy in homozygous DRD1 G allele carriers, who are assumed to have a higher D1 receptor efficiency than carriers of the A allele. In the group of homozygous DRD2 T-allele carriers, who have a higher striatal density of D2 receptors than C-allele carriers, we found a less effective and more parallel action cascading strategy. These findings suggest that, within the same sample, a higher D1 efficiency seems to shift the action cascading strategy toward a more serial processing mode, whereas the D2 receptors seem to promote a shift in the opposite direction by inducing a more parallel processing mode. Furthermore, the neurophysiological analysis shows that the observed differences are not based on attentional differences or basic inhibition. Instead, processes linking stimulus processing and response execution seem to differentiate between more serial and more parallel processing groups.

Haloperidol differentially modulates prepulse inhibition and p50 suppression in healthy humans stratified for low and high gating levels.	DOI: 10.1038/sj.npp.1301421	Schizophrenia patients exhibit deficits in sensory gating as indexed by reduced prepulse inhibition (PPI) and P50 suppression, which have been linked to psychotic symptom formation and cognitive deficits. Although recent evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotics might be superior over typical antipsychotics in reversing PPI and P50 suppression deficits not only in schizophrenia patients, but also in healthy volunteers exhibiting low levels of PPI, the impact of typical antipsychotics on these gating measures is less clear. To explore the impact of the dopamine D2-like receptor system on gating and cognition, the acute effects of haloperidol on PPI, P50 suppression, and cognition were assessed in 26 healthy male volunteers split into subgroups having low vs high PPI or P50 suppression levels using a placebo-controlled within-subject design. Haloperidol failed to increase PPI in subjects exhibiting low levels of PPI, but attenuated PPI in those subjects with high sensorimotor gating levels. Furthermore, haloperidol increased P50 suppression in subjects exhibiting low P50 gating and disrupted P50 suppression in individuals expressing high P50 gating levels. Independently of drug condition, high PPI levels were associated with superior strategy formation and execution times in a subset of cognitive tests. Moreover, haloperidol impaired spatial working memory performance and planning ability. These findings suggest that dopamine D2-like receptors are critically involved in the modulation of P50 suppression in healthy volunteers, and to a lesser extent also in PPI among subjects expressing high sensorimotor gating levels. Furthermore, the results suggest a relation between sensorimotor gating and working memory performance.

Latent Toxoplasma gondii infection leads to improved action control.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bbi.2013.11.004	The parasite Toxoplasma gondii has been found to manipulate the behavior of its secondary hosts to increase its own dissemination which is commonly believed to be to the detriment of the host (manipulation hypothesis). The manipulation correlates with an up-regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission. In humans, different pathologies have been associated with T. gondii infections but most latently infected humans do not seem to display overt impairments. Since a dopamine plus does not necessarily bear exclusively negative consequences in humans, we investigated potential positive consequences of latent toxoplasmosis (and the presumed boosting of dopaminergic neurotransmission) on human cognition and behavior. For this purpose, we focused on action cascading which has been shown to be modulated by dopamine. Based on behavioral and neurophysiological (EEG) data obtained by means of a stop-change paradigm, we were able to demonstrate that healthy young humans can actually benefit from latent T. gondii infection as regards their performance in this task (as indicated by faster response times and a smaller P3 component). The data shows that a latent infection which is assumed to affect the dopaminergic system can lead to paradoxical improvements of cognitive control processes in humans.

Association between dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene polymorphisms and novelty-elicited auditory event-related potentials in preschool children.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.03.021	We investigated associations of the exon III repeat and the -521 C/T polymorphisms of the DRD4 gene with novelty-elicited auditory ERP components and behavioral resistance to distraction in 57 healthy, typically developing 6-year-old children. Dopamine-related gene polymorphisms have previously been linked to processes directing focused attention. We did not find associations between the 7-repeat allele or the T.7 haplotype and the early ERP responses suggesting that DRD4 polymorphisms did not affect the detection of novelty. However, the same polymorphisms affected the late negative components (LN1 and LN2). Late negativities elicited by deviant and novel sounds have been regarded as reflecting reorientation after distraction or additional processing of new information. Children carrying the T.7 haplotype had significantly smaller LN1 and LN2 amplitudes. The presence of the T.7 haplotype also significantly enhanced behavioral resistance to distraction. We suggest that less distraction in T.7 carriers led to less reorienting activity (reflected by the LN components). We also speculate that activation of less sensitive and fewer D4 receptors (as with the T.7 haplotype) is less effective in modulating GABAergic inhibitory signaling, which in turn is reflected in smaller LN amplitudes.

Electrophysiological assessment of nociception in patients with Parkinson's disease: A multi-methods approach.

The disturbances are mostly responsive to dopaminergic (DA) treatment; yet, there are conflicting results. The objective of the present study was to investigate pain processing and nociception in PD patients in a more comprehensive manner than previous studies.

Changes in the stimulus-preceding negativity and lateralized readiness potential during reinforcement learning.	DOI: 10.1111/psyp.12859	According to reinforcement learning theory, dopamine-dependent anticipatory processes play a critical role in learning from action outcomes such as feedback or reward. To better understand outcome anticipation, we examined variation in slow cortical potentials and assessed their changes over the course of motor-skill acquisition. Healthy young adults learned a series of precisely timed, key press sequences. Feedback was delivered at a delay of either 2.5 or 8 s, to encourage use of either the striatally mediated, habit learning system or the hippocampus-dependent, episodic memory system, respectively. During the 2.5-s delay, the stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) was shown to decline in amplitude across trials, confirming previous results from a perceptual categorization task (Morís, Luque, & Rodríguez-Fornells, 2013). This falsifies the hypothesis that SPN reflects specific outcome predictions, on the assumption that the ability to make such predictions should improve as a task is mastered. An SPN was also evident during the 8-s delay, but it increased in amplitude across trials. At the conclusion of the 8-s but not the 2.5-s prefeedback interval, a reversed-polarity lateralized readiness potential (LRP) was noted. It was suggested that this might indicate maintenance of an action representation for comparison with the feedback display. If so, this would constitute the first direct psychophysiological evidence for a popular hypothetical construct in quantitative models of reinforcement learning, the so-called eligibility trace.

Dissociable genetic contributions to error processing: a multimodal neuroimaging study.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0101784	Neuroimaging studies reliably identify two markers of error commission: the error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential, and functional MRI activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). While theorized to reflect the same neural process, recent evidence suggests that the ERN arises from the posterior cingulate cortex not the dACC.

The DRD2 C957T polymorphism and the attentional blink--a genetic association study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2012.09.010	The attentional blink phenomenon (AB) describes a transient deficit in temporally selective visual attention regarding the processing of the second of two target stimuli in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. The AB is a very prominent paradigm in the Cognitive Neurosciences that has been extensively studied by diverse psychophysiological techniques such as EEG or fMRI. Association studies from molecular genetics are scarce although the high heritability of higher cognitive functioning is proven. Only one seminal study reported an association between AB magnitude and the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) C957T polymorphism (Colzato et al., 2011). This functional polymorphism influences striatal D2 receptor binding affinity and thereby the efficacy of dopaminergic neurotransmission which is important for working memory and attentional processes. Colzato et al. (2011) reported that DRD2 C957T T/T-carriers exhibit a significant smaller AB than C-allele carriers. In the present study this influence of the DRD2 SNP on the AB could not be replicated in N=211 healthy participants. However, a significantly larger lag 1 sparing was observed for homozygous T/T-carriers. Moreover, carriers of at least one T-allele showed a significantly poorer performance in the identification of T1. In general, these results support the notion of a role of the dopaminergic system on the AB. However, as our results do not parallel previous findings the exact nature of this influence and its dependence on task parameters will have to be examined in further genetic association studies.

Neurophysiological mechanisms of circadian cognitive control in RLS patients - an EEG source localization study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nicl.2017.06.018	The circadian variation of sensory and motor symptoms with increasing severity in the evening and at night is a key diagnostic feature/symptom of the restless legs syndrome (RLS). Even though many neurological diseases have shown a strong nexus between motor and cognitive symptoms, it has remained unclear whether cognitive performance of RLS patients declines in the evening and which neurophysiological mechanisms are affected by the circadian variation. In the current study, we examined daytime effects (morning vs. evening) on cognitive performance in RLS patients (n = 33) compared to healthy controls (n = 29) by analyzing flanker interference effects in combination with EEG and source localization techniques. RLS patients showed larger flanker interference effects in the evening than in the morning (p = .023), while healthy controls did not display a comparable circadian variation. In line with this, the neurophysiological data showed smaller N1 amplitudes in RLS patients compared to controls in the interfering task condition in the evening (p = .042), but not in the morning. The results demonstrate diurnal cognitive changes in RLS patients with intensified impairments in the evening. It seems that not all dopamine-regulated cognitive processes are altered in RLS and thus show daytime-dependent impairments. Instead, the daytime-related cognitive impairment emerges from attentional selection processes within the extra-striate visual cortex, but not from later cognitive processes such as conflict monitoring and response selection.

Dissociable electrophysiological subprocesses during response inhibition are differentially modulated by dopamine D1 and D2 receptors.	DOI: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2016.03.002	Action control is achieved through a multitude of cognitive processes. One of them is the ability to inhibit responses, for which the dopaminergic systems is known to play an important role. Many lines of psychophysiological research substantiate that two distinct response inhibition subprocesses exist, but it has remained elusive whether they can be attributed to distinct neurobiological factors governing the dopaminergic system. We, therefore, investigated this question by examining the effects of DRD1 (rs4532) and DRD2 (rs6277) receptor polymorphisms on electrophysiological correlates of response inhibition subprocesses (i.e., Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3) in 195 healthy human subjects with a standard Go/Nogo task. The results show that response inhibition performance at a behavioral level is affected by DRD1 and DRD2 receptor variation. However, from an electrophysiological point of view these effects emerge via different mechanisms selectively affected by DRD1 and DRD2 receptor variation. While the D1 receptor system is associated with pre-motor inhibition electrophysiological correlates of response inhibition processes (Nogo-N2), the D2 receptor system is associated with electrophysiological correlates of outcome evaluation processes. Dissociable cognitive-neurophysiological subprocesses of response inhibition are hence attributable to distinct dopamine receptor systems.

Prolonged P300 latency in children with the D2 dopamine receptor A1 allele.		Previous studies have indicated the presence of a hereditary component in the generation of the P300, or P3, a late positive component of the event-related potential. Moreover, the dopaminergic system has been implicated in the P3. In the present study, 98 healthy Caucasian boys, mean age of 12.5 years and of above-average intelligence, were studied. The sample was composed of 32 sons of active alcoholic (SAA) fathers, 36 sons of recovering alcoholic (SRA) fathers, and 30 sons of social drinker (SSD) fathers, with none of them having yet begun to consume alcohol or other drugs. TaqI A D2 dopamine receptor alleles (A1 and A2) were determined. A significant difference in the frequency of the A1 allele was found among these three groups of boys, with the SAA group having the highest A1 allele frequency (.313), followed by the SRA (.139) and the SSD (.133) groups. The relationship of the A1 and A2 alleles to P3 amplitude and latency was also determined. The results showed no significant difference in P3 amplitude between boys with the A1 and A2 allele. However, P3 latency was significantly longer in the total sample of boys with the A1 allele compared with those carrying the A2 allele. These findings suggest that polymorphism of the D2 dopamine receptor gene is an important determinant of P3 latency.

The role of DAT1 gene on the rapid detection of task novelty.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.10.005	In an environment with a myriad of different stimuli, the fast detection of novel and behaviorally relevant signals becomes crucial for an adaptive behavior. The detection of task-novelty has been related to striatum-prefrontal cortex (PFC) pathways involving dopaminergic (DA) neurotransmission. Here we thus tested the hypothesis that DA regulates the detection of task novelty through the modulation of the auditory N1 potential, an auditory potential peaking at 100 ms and previously shown to be modulated by the detection of sensory novelty. Thirty-five healthy volunteers were divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of the 9-repetition allele (9R) of the SLC6A3/DAT1 gene for the dopamine transporter. Participants performed a cued task-switching paradigm that dissociated the effects of exogenous sensory novelty from those of endogenous task novelty. Individuals with the 9R allele showed an amplitude enhancement of the auditory N1 elicited to sensory changes requiring a task-set reconfiguration as compared to sensory changes with no task novelty. In contrast, individuals without the 9R allele did not have their N1 waveform modulated by task novelty. The present results suggest that individuals homozygous for the 10-repeat allele fail to detect the behavioral relevance of new stimuli at early stages.

Hypersynchrony despite pathologically reduced beta oscillations in patients with Parkinson's disease: a pharmaco-magnetoencephalography study.	DOI: 10.1152/jn.00383.2014	"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive debilitating neurodegenerative disorder clinically manifest by motor, posture and gait abnormalities. Human neurophysiological studies recording local field potentials within the subthalamic nucleus and scalp-based electroencephalography have shown pathological beta synchrony throughout the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical motor network in PD. Notably, suppression of this pathological beta synchrony by dopamine replacement therapy or deep-brain stimulation has been associated with improved motor function. However, due to the invasive nature of these studies, it remains unknown whether this ""pathological beta"" is actually stronger than that observed in healthy demographically matched controls. We used magnetoencephalography to investigate neuronal synchrony and oscillatory amplitude in the beta range and lower frequencies during the resting state in patients with PD and a matched group of patients without neurological disease. Patients with PD were studied both in the practically defined drug ""OFF"" state, and after administration of dopamine replacements. We found that beta oscillatory amplitude was reduced bilaterally in the primary motor regions of unmedicated patients with PD compared with controls. Administration of dopaminergic medications significantly increased beta oscillatory activity, thus having a normalizing effect. Interestingly, we also found significantly stronger beta synchrony (i.e., hypersynchrony) between the primary motor regions in unmedicated patients with PD compared with controls, and that medication reduced this coupling which is in agreement with the intraoperative studies. These results are consistent with the known functionality of the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical motor circuit and the likely consequences of beta hypersynchrony in the subthalamic nucleus of patients with PD."

An EEG marker of reward processing is diminished in Parkinson's disease.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146541	The electroencephalographic signal known as the Reward Positivity (RewP) scales with the reward prediction error following reward receipt. This signal is computationally identical to the dopamine-driven learning process relating to the discrepancy between reward expectation and reward acquisition. The current study aimed to investigate if the RewP is diminished in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, 28 people with PD and 28 age- and sex-matched healthy controls completed a reinforcement-learning task. In line with expectations, the RewP was smaller in persons with PD than in controls. Yet contrary to expectations, RewP amplitude did not differ in on vs. off medication conditions, and it was positively correlated with the number of years diagnosed with PD. We propose that this symptom-specific alteration in RewP may be a consequence of a common methodological procedure in PD research (e.g. restricted recruitment) or it might truly be a marker of early-stage disease (e.g. prior to network re-adaptation). These surprising findings motivate separate testable hypotheses for assessing aspects of PD with this novel neural marker of reward.

During 12-Hz intermittent photic stimulation (IPS), reactivity of posterior electrodes was decreased in PD and LBD patients. No reactivity was observed in PDD.

Standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography in obsessive-compulsive disorder--a replication study.	DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2013.05.015	Previous EEG source localization studies in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) reported ambiguous results. The reason probably lies in different OCD samples included in the studies - obsessive-compulsive subjects selected based on a psychopathology questionnaire (the Symptom Checklist - Revised), drug-naïve OCD cases or patients with a long-term disorder. This study was conceived as a replication of our previous research on OCD population coming to treatment in Prague Psychiatric Centre [9]. We included 50 OCD patients (8 drug-free and 42 medicated with SSRIs) and 50 healthy controls. All subjects were different from those enrolled in the previous study. Resting state EEG was analyzed in 8 frequency bands as well as with 1 Hz frequency resolution using the standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). In OCD, sLORETA indicated low-frequency power excess at 2 and 3 Hz in the cingulate gyrus with maximal t-values in Brodmann area 24. The low-frequency activity was unrelated to the severity of clinical symptoms and illness duration but delta power in the right orbitofrontal cortex positively correlated with age of OCD onset. Our results confirm previous finding of the low-frequency excess in the cingulate gyrus in OCD and document the essential role of delta frequencies. Delta activity in the cingulate gyrus is negatively associated with reward-signalling dopamine release in the ventral striatum and increases in states connected with a need for reinforcement. Thus, delta activity could reflect a repetitive need to perform compulsive behaviour in OCD patients.

Early onset cigarette smokers exhibit greater P300 reactivity to smoking-related stimuli and report greater craving.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2018.02.037	Adolescence is a period during which a number of critical neuromaturation processes occur and the vulnerability for developing nicotine dependence is extremely high. Thus, early-onset (EO; age < 16 years old), relative to late-onset (LO; age ≥ 16 years old), tobacco smoking may be uniquely deleterious for developmentally immature systems that regulate neural signaling reactivity. This study investigated how age of tobacco smoking onset affects neurophysiological measures of smoking cue reactivity and reported craving in adult smokers. EO smokers (EOS; n = 8; 4 females), LO smokers (LOS; n = 10; 5 females), and healthy non-smokers (HNS; n = 10; 5 females) participated in an event-related potential (ERP) cue reactivity study with tactile and image stimuli. Participants handled neutral objects during one interval and smoking-related objects during a second interval. After each interval, they viewed smoking-related, neutral, or arousing images using an oddball paradigm. P300 ERPs and craving for tobacco were recorded during each session. P300 amplitudes were significantly higher in central midline (Cz) channel to smoking, but not neutral or arousing, images after handling smoking objects. Specifically, Cz P300 smoking amplitudes were significantly greater in EOS, relative to LOS and HNS, and associated with greater craving at baseline. There were no other group differences in mood or craving. EOS exhibited greater P300 reactivity to smoking-related stimuli, relative to LOS, suggesting a more sensitized neural response. EO smoking during early neuromaturation may alter neurophysiological signaling involved in responding to smoking-related stimuli, which could impact the outcome of smoking cessation interventions.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation reduces cigarette consumption in schizophrenia patients.	DOI: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2013.10.019	High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) seemed to decrease tobacco consumption and craving in nicotine-dependent people without psychiatric disorder or otherwise healthy people. Even if the prevalence of cigarette smoking in schizophrenia patients is high and estimated to be between 45% and 88%, this technique has not been systematically studied in this indication in schizophrenia yet.

How smoking affects sleep: a polysomnographical analysis.	DOI: 10.1016/j.sleep.2012.06.026	Subjective quality of sleep is impaired in smokers compared with non-smokers, but there is only limited evidence from methodologically sound studies about differences in polysomnography (PSG) sleep characteristics.

The impact of early life stress on psychophysiological, personality and behavioral measures in 740 non-clinical subjects.	DOI: 10.1142/s0219635205000689	Early Life Stress (ELS) has been associated with a range of adverse outcomes in adults, including abnormalities in electrical brain activity [1], personality dimensions [40], increased vulnerability to substance abuse and depression [14]. The present study seeks to quantify these proposed effects in a large sample of non-clinical subjects. Data for the study was obtained from The Brain Resource International Database (six laboratories: two in USA, two in Europe, two in Australia). This study analyzed scalp electrophysiological data (EEG eyes open, closed and target auditory oddball data) and personality (NEO-FFI), history of addictive substance use and ELS) data that was acquired from 740 healthy volunteers. The ELS measures were collected via a self-report measure and covered a broad range of events from childhood sexual and physical abuse, to first-hand experience of traumatizing accidents and sustained domestic conflict [41]. Analysis of covariance, controlling for age and gender, compared EEG data from subjects exposed to ELS with those who were unexposed. ELS was associated with significantly decreased power across the EEG spectrum. The between group differences were strongest in the eyes closed paradigm, where subjects who experienced ELS showed significantly reduced beta (F1,405=12.37, p=.000), theta (F1,405=20.48, p=.000), alpha (F1,405=9.65, p=.002) and delta power (F1,450=36.22, p=.000). ELS exposed subjects also showed a significantly higher alpha peak frequency (F1,405=6.39, p=.012) in the eyes closed paradigm. Analysis of covariance on ERP components revealed that subjects who experienced ELS had significantly decreased N2 amplitude (F1,405=7.73, p=.006). Analyses of variance conducted on measures of personality revealed that subjects who experienced ELS had significantly higher levels of neuroticism (F1,264=13.39, p=.000) and openness (F1,264=17.11, p=.000), but lower levels of conscientiousness, than controls (F1,264=4.08, p=.044). The number of ELS events experienced was shown to be a significant predictor of scores on the DASS questionnaire [27], which rates subjects on symptoms of depression (F3,688=16.44, p=.000, R2=.07), anxiety (F3,688=14.32, p=.000, R2=.06) and stress (F3,688=20.02, p=.000, R2=.08). Each additional early life stressor was associated with an increase in these scores independent of age, gender and the type of stressor. Furthermore, the number of ELS experiences among smokers was also found to be a positive predictor of the nicotine dependency score (Faegstrom Test For Nicotine Dependence, [19]) (F3,104=10.99, p=.000, R2=.24), independent of age, gender and type of stressor. In conclusion, we highlight the impact of a history of ELS showed significant effects on brain function (EEG and ERP activity), personality dimensions and nicotine dependence.

Assessing the topographic EEG changes associated with aging and acute/long-term effects of smoking.	DOI: 10.1159/000119279	As neuroelectric research into the smoking/nicotine habit has focused exclusively on young and middle-aged adults, this electroencephalographic (EEG) study was conducted to determine whether a long-term smoking history alters the aging brain and/or whether the aging brain demonstrates an altered sensitivity to acute smoking/nicotine. Forty healthy adults, 20 young, aged 18-39 years, and 20 elderly, aged 64-81 years, volunteered for participation. Half of the young and elderly were nonsmokers with no previous smoking history and the remaining half of the young and elderly were current smokers with average smoking histories of 9.3 and 52.0 years, respectively. Smokers attended the laboratory for two randomized test sessions during which multisite EEG recordings were collected pre and post sham and cigarette smoking. Nonsmokers attended the laboratory for one nonsmoking EEG recording session. Spectral power indices showed aging to be associated with significant reductions in absolute delta and theta power and increases in relative beta power and faster mean total band frequency. Aging effects varied with recording region but not with smoker versus nonsmoker status. Smokers did exhibit a faster mean beta frequency. Acute cigarette smoking decreased absolute delta power in young smokers and increased relative alpha 2, beta power and mean alpha frequency in both young and elderly smokers. Only the young smokers showed increase in mean theta and total frequency. The results are discussed in relation to cognition in normal and pathological aging.

Effects of cigarette smoking upon frequencies of EEG alpha rhythm and finger tapping.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02244307	Under the influence of nicotine, an increase in EEG alpha frequency as well as finger tapping speed has been reported from separate experiments, and it has also been shown that tapping and alpha frequencies may correlate in defined experimental settings. The present study aimed at the analysis of smoking effects using parallel recordings of both EEG and finger tapping. Twelve healthy subjects were tested in two sessions (smoking deprivation versus smoking). After smoking, both dominant alpha frequency (P less than 0.05) and tapping performance (P less than 0.001) were higher than during deprivation. In most subjects, the increase of both parameters developed in parallel, and during phases of very stable tapping the ratio of alpha and tapping frequencies was close to 2:1. Both frequencies correlated during the deprived (r = 0.6108, P = 0.035) as well as the smoking (r = 0.7009, P = 0.011) conditions. Results confirm earlier findings regarding the effect of smoking upon EEG and tapping, and the parallel changes of both parameters may be attributed to the pharmacological properties of nicotine. Besides possible peripheral and spinal effects of nicotine, the increase of tapping performance parallels the increased frequency of central nervous pacemakers.

mGluR5 binding changes during a mismatch negativity task in a multimodal protocol with [11C]ABP688 PET/MR-EEG.	DOI: 10.1038/s41398-021-01763-3	Currently, the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is the subject of several lines of research in the context of neurology and is of high interest as a target for positron-emission tomography (PET). Here, we assessed the feasibility of using [11C]ABP688, a specific antagonist radiotracer for an allosteric site on the mGluR5, to evaluate changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission through a mismatch-negativity (MMN) task as a part of a simultaneous and synchronized multimodal PET/MR-EEG study. We analyzed the effect of MMN by comparing the changes in nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) prior to (baseline) and during the task in 17 healthy subjects by applying a bolus/infusion protocol. Anatomical and functional regions were analyzed. A small change in BPND was observed in anatomical regions (posterior cingulate cortex and thalamus) and in a functional network (precuneus) after the start of the task. The effect size was quantified using Kendall's W value and was 0.3. The motor cortex was used as a control region for the task and did not show any significant BPND changes. There was a significant ΔBPND between acquisition conditions. On average, the reductions in binding across the regions were - 8.6 ± 3.2% in anatomical and - 6.4 ± 0.5% in the functional network (p ≤ 0.001). Correlations between ΔBPND and EEG latency for both anatomical (p = 0.008) and functional (p = 0.022) regions were found. Exploratory analyses suggest that the MMN task played a role in the glutamatergic neurotransmission, and mGluR5 may be indirectly modulated by these changes.

Comparison of chemosensory, auditory and visual event-related potential amplitudes.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-9450.2008.00647.x	To enhance understanding of neuropsychological processing underlying chemosensory event-related potentials (CSERPs), the objective of the present study was to compare CSERPs with auditory (AERPs) and visual event-related potentials (VERPs), and to approach the question of similarities in neuropsychological processing by means of correlation and cluster analyses. A multisensory ERP protocol was used, in which olfactory/chemosomatosensory (pyridine), auditory (1000-Hz tone) and visual (white circle) stimuli were presented in a pseudo-randomized sequence to 18 young, healthy adults. The results show (1) a morphological relation between P2 and P3 components that is different for the chemosensory than for the auditory and visual modalities, (2) a relatively weak association between the chemosensory and auditory/visual modalities for P3 in terms of both correlation and cluster, and (3) a P2/P3 cluster for the chemosensory but not auditory or visual modality. This supports the claim that the chemosensory P2 and P3 components reflect similar neuropsychological processes.

Dimethindene maleate in the treatment of sunburn. A double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.	DOI: 10.1055/s-0031-1300429	The efficacy of topical dimethindene maleate (DMM, CAS 31614-69-5, Fenistil Gel) in the treatment of sunburn was evaluated in a placebo-controlled, 1-period crossover trial in 24 healthy volunteers. An UV-erythema (sunburn) of a well-defined intensity and extent was experimentally induced on three different skin test-areas by means of UV-A/B irradiation with three times the minimal erythema dose (MED). About 24 h after irradiation, one skin test-area was subjected to a 1-h occlusive treatment with DMM gel, the second test area was subjected to treatment with a placebo gel and the third one remained untreated. As objective-quantitative indicators of tenderness, a key symptom of sunburn, sensory and pain thresholds to CO2-Laser stimulation and laser somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in Vertex-EEG were assessed about 1.5 h postdose. The reaction times (RTs) to painless and painful CO2-laser stimulation (sensory and pain threshold level, respectively) on the DMM-treated area were significantly longer than RTs to stimulation on the placebo-treated area. Thresholds in terms of laser energy showed no differences between the treatments. The SEP N1-amplitude on the DMM-area was markedly decreased in comparison to placebo. With regard to subjective sensations of pain, itching and tenderness assessed by means of visual analogue scales (VAS), no clinically relevant differences between treatments were observed after sole UV-irradiation. After additional laser stimulation tenderness was--objectively but not subjectively--decreased on the DMM-area versus placebo. Both gel preparations were well tolerated.

Working memory deficits in patients with idiopathic restless legs syndrome are associated with abnormal theta-band neural synchrony.	DOI: 10.1111/jsr.13287	Cognitive impairment, particularly prefrontal function, has been reported in patients with restless legs syndrome. However, working memory performance in patients with restless legs syndrome remains uncertain. The present study aimed to examine working memory performance in patients with restless legs syndrome by investigating electroencephalography theta-band oscillations within task-relevant brain regions and the synchronization among oscillations during a working memory task. Twelve female idiopathic patients with restless legs syndrome and 12 female healthy controls participated in this study. Nineteen-channel electroencephalography data were recorded while participants performed a Sternberg working memory task. We analysed event-related theta-band activity and interregional theta-band phase synchrony during the memory retrieval phase. The spatial pattern of theta-band phase synchrony was quantified using graph theory measures, including the clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and small-world propensity. Considerable increases in theta-band activity and theta-band phase synchrony were observed at 600-700 ms in controls and at 650-750 ms in restless legs syndrome subjects after the probe item was presented. During this period, induced theta-band activity showed lower with borderline significance in the restless legs syndrome subjects than in the controls regardless of channel location (F4,88  = 3.92, p = .06). Theta-band phase synchrony between the frontal and posterior regions was significantly reduced in the restless legs syndrome subjects. Inefficiency in both global and local networks in the restless legs syndrome subjects was revealed by the decreased small-world propensity (t22  = 2.26, p = .03). Small-world propensity was negatively correlated with restless legs syndrome severity (r = -.65, p = .02). Our findings suggest that patients with restless legs syndrome have multiple deficits in cognitive processes, including attentional allocation, evaluation of incoming stimuli, and memory manipulation of encoded information during a working memory task. Abnormal local theta-band neural synchrony and global theta-band neural synchrony may underlie the neurophysiological mechanism of the working memory dysfunction associated with restless legs syndrome.

Evaluation of short interval cortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-17052-3	GABAergic and glutamatergic dysfunction in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are thought to be the core pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia. Recently, we have established a method to index these functions from the DLPFC using the paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigms of short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF) combined with electroencephalography (EEG). In this study, we aimed to evaluate neurophysiological indicators related to GABAA and glutamate receptor-mediated functions respectively from the DLPFC in patients with schizophrenia using these paradigms, compared to healthy controls. Given that these activities contribute to cognitive functions, the relationship between the TMS-evoked potential (TEP) modulations by SICI/ICF and cognitive/clinical measures were explored. Compared to controls, patients showed reduced inhibition in P60 (t22 = -4.961, p < 0.0001) by SICI and reduced facilitation in P60 (t22 = 5.174, p < 0.0001) and N100 (t22 = 3.273, p = 0.003) by ICF. In patients, the modulation of P60 by SICI was correlated with the longest span of the Letter-Number Span Test (r = -0.775, p = 0.003), while the modulation of N100 by ICF was correlated with the total score of the Positive and Negative. Syndrome Scale (r = 0.817, p = 0.002). These findings may represent the pathophysiology, which may be associated with prefrontal GABAA and glutamatergic dysfunctions, in the expression of symptoms of schizophrenia.

Maternal smoking impairs arousal patterns in sleeping infants.	DOI: 10.1093/sleep/32.4.515	Impairment of the arousal process from sleep is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

We aimed to examine the arousal process in a group of infants exposed to maternal smoking, who are thus at higher risk for SIDS.

Effects of sleep position, sleep state and age on heart rate responses following provoked arousal in term infants.	DOI: 10.1016/s0378-3782(03)00005-7	Previous studies have suggested that autonomic dysfunction may be involved in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The major risk factors for SIDS are the prone sleeping position and maternal smoking. Our aim was to examine the effects of sleeping position and maternal smoking on the postnatal maturation of autonomic function by examining heart rate responses following arousal in healthy term infants. Twenty-four infants (11 born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy and 13 to mother who did not smoke) were studied using daytime polysomnography and multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cm H(2)O) in response to air-jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). We demonstrated no difference between smoking and non-smoking groups of infants in any of our measurements, and thus combined data from the groups. Baseline (BHR) was elevated in the prone compared to the supine position in quiet sleep (QS) at 2-3 weeks (p<0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.001), and in active sleep (AS) at 2-3 and 5-6 months (p<0.05). BHR was significantly elevated in AS compared to QS in the supine position at all ages (p<0.01) and in the prone position at 2-3 (p<0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.05). Increases in heart rate (deltaHR%) following arousal were significantly greater in the supine compared to the prone position in QS at 2-3 weeks (p<0.05) and in AS at both 2-3 (p<0.01) and 5-6 months (p<0.05). DeltaHR% was significantly greater in AS compared to QS in both supine (p<0.05) and prone (p<0.001) positions at 2-3 weeks and in the supine position at 2-3 months (p<0.001). We conclude that sleep state, sleep position and postnatal age affect the cardiac responses following arousal from sleep in healthy term infants. Impairment of heart rate control in the prone position may be important in understanding the increased risk for SIDS in this position.

Combined multivariate matching pursuit and support vector machine: a way forward to classify single-sweep evoked potentials?	DOI: 10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090898	Evoked brain potentials averaged over multiple sweeps provide a valuable objective measure of abnormal pain processing due to sensitization of the central nervous system. However, the average procedure cancel out important information regarding phase resetting and non-phase locked oscillations. Hence, assessment of the pain processing could be optimized by analyzing single-sweeps. To develop improved methods to assess single-sweeps, we applied a new approach in one healthy volunteer participating in a placebo controlled study of widespread hyperalgesia induced by perfusion of acid and capsaicin in the esophagus. The evoked potentials were recorded during electrical stimulations in the rectosigmoid colon. Features from the single-sweeps were extracted by a multivariate matching pursuit algorithm with Gabor atoms, and features were discriminated by a support vector machine with a linear kernel. The classification performance for the optimal number of atoms was 95% when discriminating the sensitization response from the placebo response, which was above change level compared to the performance when discriminating the two baseline responses (P < 0.001). The discriminative capacity was increased power in the delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands. This result corresponds to previous characteristics seen in chronic pain patients who exhibit central sensitization. The new approach to classify single-sweeps on a single subject basis might in the future prove to be a useful tool in assessing mechanisms in central sensitization, and could be applied to improve enriched enrollment of study subjects in clinical trial units.

Angular gyrus connectivity at alpha and beta oscillations is reduced during tonic pain - Differential effect of eye state.	DOI: 10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102907	The angular gyrus (AG) is a common hub in the pain networks. The role of the AG during pain perception, however, is still unclear. This crossover study examined the effect of tonic pain on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the AG under eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO). It included two sessions (placebo/pain) separated by 24 hours. Pain was induced using topical capsaicin (or placebo as control) on the right forearm. Electroencephalographic rsFC assessed by Granger causality was acquired from 28 healthy participants (14 women) before (baseline) and 1-hour following the application of placebo/capsaicin. Subjects were randomly assigned and balanced to groups of recording sequence (EC-EO, EO-EC). Decreased rsFC at alpha-1 and beta, but not alpha-2, oscillations was found during pain compared to baseline during EC only. For alpha-1, EC-EO group showed a pain-induced decrease only among connections between the right AG and each of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, P = 0.002), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, P = 0.005), and the left AG (P = 0.023). For beta rsFC, the EC-EO group showed a bilateral decrease in rsFC spanning the connections between the right AG and mPFC (P = 0.015) and between the left AG and each of PCC (P = 0.004) and mPFC (P = 0.026). In contrast, the EO-EC group showed an increase in beta rsFC only among connections between the left AG and each of PCC (P = 0.012) and mPFC (P = 0.036). No significant change in the AG rsFC was found during EO. These results provide insight into the involvement of the AG in pain perception and reveal methodological considerations when assessing rsFC during EO and EC.

Sensorimotor Peak Alpha Frequency Is a Reliable Biomarker of Prolonged Pain Sensitivity.	DOI: 10.1093/cercor/bhaa124	Previous research has observed that the speed of alpha band oscillations (8-12 Hz range) recorded during resting electroencephalography is slowed in chronic pain patients. While this slowing may reflect pathological changes that occur during the chronification of pain, an alternative explanation is that healthy individuals with slower alpha oscillations are more sensitive to prolonged pain, and by extension, more susceptible to developing chronic pain. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the pain-free, resting alpha oscillation speed of healthy individuals and their sensitivity to two models of prolonged pain, Phasic Heat Pain and Capsaicin Heat Pain, at two visits separated by 8 weeks on average (n = 61 Visit 1, n = 46 Visit 2). We observed that the speed of an individual's pain-free alpha oscillations was negatively correlated with sensitivity to both models and that this relationship was reliable across short (minutes) and long (weeks) timescales. Furthermore, the speed of pain-free alpha oscillations can successfully identify the most pain sensitive individuals, which we validated on data from a separate, independent study. These results suggest that alpha oscillation speed is a reliable biomarker of prolonged pain sensitivity with potential for prospectively identifying pain sensitivity in the clinic.

Temporal dynamics of electroencephalographic microstates during sustained pain.	DOI: 10.1093/cercor/bhad143	"Brain dynamics can be modeled by a sequence of transient, nonoverlapping patterns of quasi-stable electrical potentials named ""microstates."" While electroencephalographic (EEG) microstates among patients with chronic pain remained inconsistent in the literature, this study characterizes the temporal dynamics of EEG microstates among healthy individuals during experimental sustained pain. We applied capsaicin (pain condition) or control (no-pain condition) cream to 58 healthy participants in different sessions and recorded resting-state EEG 15 min after application. We identified 4 canonical microstates (A-D) that are related to auditory, visual, salience, and attentional networks. Microstate C had less occurrence, as were bidirectional transitions between microstate C and microstates A and B during sustained pain. In contrast, sustained pain was associated with more frequent and longer duration of microsite D, as well as more bidirectional transitions between microstate D and microstates A and B. Microstate D duration positively correlated with intensity of ongoing pain. Sustained pain improved global integration within microstate C functional network, but weakened global integration and efficiency within microstate D functional network. These results suggest that sustained pain leads to an imbalance between processes that load on saliency (microstate C) and processes related to switching and reorientation of attention (microstate D)."

Towards the Objective Identification of the Presence of Pain Based on Electroencephalography Signals' Analysis: A Proof-of-Concept.	DOI: 10.3390/s22166272	"This proof-of-concept study explores the potential of developing objective pain identification based on the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Data were collected from participants living with chronic fibromyalgia pain (n = 4) and from healthy volunteers (n = 7) submitted to experimental pain by the application of capsaicin cream (1%) on the right upper trapezius. This data collection was conducted in two parts: (1) baseline measures including pain intensity and EEG signals, with the participant at rest; (2) active measures collected under the execution of a visuo-motor task, including EEG signals and the task performance index. The main measure for the objective identification of the presence of pain was the coefficient of variation of the upper envelope (CVUE) of the EEG signal from left fronto-central (FC5) and left temporal (T7) electrodes, in alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma (30-43 Hz) frequency bands. The task performance index was also calculated. CVUE (%) was compared between groups: those with chronic fibromyalgia pain, healthy volunteers with ""No pain"" and healthy volunteers with experimentally-induced pain. The identification of the presence of pain was determined by an increased CVUE in beta (CVUEβ) from the EEG signals captured at the left FC5 electrode. More specifically, CVUEβ increased up to 20% in the pain condition at rest. In addition, no correlation was found between CVUEβ and pain intensity or the task performance index. These results support the objective identification of the presence of pain based on the quantification of the coefficient of variation of the upper envelope of the EEG signal."

Electrocortical Effects of Acetaminophen during Emotional Picture Viewing, Cognitive Control, and Negative Feedback.	DOI: 10.3758/s13415-021-00866-0	Acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, may have psychological effects, such as reducing social and emotional pain. The current study (N = 173) used electroencephalography (EEG) to extend past research on acetaminophen. Healthy undergraduate students (64.7% women, age M = 18.15, SD = 3.33) were randomly assigned to ingest 1,000 mg of acetaminophen or placebo before completing emotional picture viewing (n = 143), a flanker task (n = 69), and a probabilistic learning task (n = 143) while EEG was recorded. (Sample sizes used for the analyses of each task differ from the total N due to data loss.) We observed standard event-related potentials (ERPs), including emotion-modulated late positive potentials during picture viewing and feedback-related negativity during feedback on the probabilistic learning task. We also observed standard error-related and conflict-related ERPs in the flanker task but could not adequately assess acetaminophen's effect on flanker ERPs due to excessive data loss. Acetaminophen did not alter any of the ERPs, in contrast to predictions based on prior research. Exploratory analyses revealed that acetaminophen reduced the relationship between trait behavioral inhibition system sensitivity and emotion-modulated late positive potentials. Together these findings suggest that a standard dose of acetaminophen did not reliably alter neural indicators of emotional or feedback processing. Instead, preliminary findings from our study suggested that a more nuanced relationship may exist between acetaminophen and individual differences in emotional processing, although this latter finding calls for further replication.

Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of the intravenously administered CB1 receptor agonist Org 28611 in healthy male volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/0269881108091551	CB1/CB2 agonists are reported to have sedative, amnestic, analgesic and anti-emetic properties, which would make them ideal drugs for outpatient treatments under conscious sedation. The main objective of this in human study was to assess the sedative properties of Org 28611, a potent water-soluble CB1 agonist. Single ascending doses were administered during a slow 25 min infusion and after a 1 min bolus administration to healthy male volunteers. In addition, the pharmacokinetics, amnestic properties, postural stability, electro-encephalography, behavioural and cardiovascular effects were studied. Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg was used as a positive control. The pharmacokinetic parameters were proportional to dose. No effects were observed after intravenous administration of doses up to Org 28611 1 microg/kg. Dose-related effects were observed at higher doses. Although subjects reported subjective sedation after administration of Org 28611 3-10 microg/kg, the observed sedation was considerably less than after midazolam. Org 28611 is, therefore, not suitable for providing sedation for outpatient surgical procedures and doses above the maximum tolerated dose of 3 microg/kg (either administered as a slow infusion or a bolus dose) can cause untoward psychotropic effects.

Brain protection of nicergoline against hypoxia: EEG brain mapping and psychometry.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02252925	In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial human brain function and mental performance as well as the antihypoxidotic properties of nicergoline were studied utilizing blood gas analysis, EEG brain mapping and psychometry. Hypoxic hypoxidosis was experimentally induced by a fixed gas combination of 9.8% oxygen (O2) and 90.2% nitrogen (N2) equivalent to 6,000 m altitude, which was inhaled for 23 min under normobaric conditions by 16 healthy volunteers. They received randomized after an adaptation session placebo, 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg nicergoline (NIC). Evaluation of blood gases, brain mapping and psychometry was carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 hrs oral drug administration. Blood gas analysis demonstrated a drop in PO2 from 95 to 35 and 34 mm Hg in the 14 and 23 min of inhalation, respectively. PCO2 decreased too (38 to 34 and 34 mm Hg), while pH increased (7.39 to 7.44 and 7.44). Base excess increased (-0.6 to 0.6 and 0.4) while standard bicarbonate decreased (24.4 to 24.1 and 23.8 mmol/l). Thus, blood gases remained stable between the 14 and 23 min of hypoxia during which time the neurophysiological and behavioral evaluations were carried out. EEG brain mapping exhibited an increase in delta/theta activity mostly over the parietal, temporal and central regions (left more than right), while alpha activity decreased (mostly over the parietal, central, frontal, fronto-temporal and temporo-occipital regions). 30 and 60 mg NIC attenuated this deterioration of vigilance. At the behavioral level, hypoxic hypoxidosis induced a deterioration of the noo- and thymospsyche which was mitigated by NIC. Based on 13 psychometric variables, the hypoxia-induced performance decrement was on the overall (2nd-8th hr) 43% after placebo as compared with pretreatment normoxic values, while only 29, 24 and 31% after 10, 30 and 60 mg nicergoline, respectively. The difference between placebo and the optimal dosage of nicergoline 30 mg reached the level of statistical significance (p less than 0.01, multiple Wilcoxon).

Effects on health of dietary supplementation with 100 mg d-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, daily for 6 years.	DOI: 10.1177/030006059502300504	To evaluate the clinical antioxidant effects of vitamin E, 161 healthy volunteers aged 39 to 56 years, were given 100 or 3 mg of d-alpha-tocopheryl acetate orally daily for 6 years using a randomized, double-blind design. Among the 147 volunteers who qualified for the analysis, seven of the 73 volunteers receiving 3 mg d-alpha-tocopheryl acetate daily and none of the 74 volunteers receiving 100 mg had coronary disorders including myocardial damage (P < 0.02). ST or T wave abnormalities on electrocardiograms were considered to indicate coronary disorders (four volunteers). The mean serum total tocopherol (TOC) concentration in the 100-mg group was significantly higher than that in the 3-mg group 6 months after the start of the study, and this raised value was maintained throughout the study; the level in the 3-mg group did not change significantly from the baseline value. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/total TOC ratio, a parameter of the inhibition of peroxidation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, was the only serum lipid parameter that was significantly different, at baseline, in the volunteers with coronary disorders compared with the others. These findings indicate that long-term supplementation with 100 mg tocopheryl acetate daily may prevent the early stages of coronary atherosclerosis by decreasing peroxidation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Slow cortical DC-potential responses to sweet and bitter tastes in humans.	DOI: 10.1016/s0031-9384(00)00379-6	Processing of hedonic stimulus quality is assumed to be accompanied by a tuning of cortical arousal and excitability. In this pilot study in 11 healthy humans scalp-recorded DC potentials were assessed during application of a sweet (sucrose) and bitter (quinine hydrochloride) taste, i.e., primary reinforcers of positive and negative quality. Muscular, ocular, and skin potential activity were controlled. Application of sucrose induced a widespread positive DC-potential shift with an amplitude of 40-50 microV and persisting for more than 120-s post-stimulus onset. Following administration of quinine hydrochloride, this positive shift was reduced, most distinctly between 48- and 88-s post-stimulus onset. The reduction appeared to be most consistent at anterior midline recording sites (Fz, Cz). It is assumed that the higher DC-potential positivity during sweetness than during bitterness points to a differential tuning of cortical excitability by a widespread decrease in depolarization of apical dendrites.

Two subgroups of antipsychotic-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients identified with a Gaussian mixture model on cognition and electrophysiology.	DOI: 10.1038/tp.2017.59	Deficits in information processing and cognition are among the most robust findings in schizophrenia patients. Previous efforts to translate group-level deficits into clinically relevant and individualized information have, however, been non-successful, which is possibly explained by biologically different disease subgroups. We applied machine learning algorithms on measures of electrophysiology and cognition to identify potential subgroups of schizophrenia. Next, we explored subgroup differences regarding treatment response. Sixty-six antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients and sixty-five healthy controls underwent extensive electrophysiological and neurocognitive test batteries. Patients were assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) before and after 6 weeks of monotherapy with the relatively selective D2 receptor antagonist, amisulpride (280.3±159 mg per day). A reduced principal component space based on 19 electrophysiological variables and 26 cognitive variables was used as input for a Gaussian mixture model to identify subgroups of patients. With support vector machines, we explored the relation between PANSS subscores and the identified subgroups. We identified two statistically distinct subgroups of patients. We found no significant baseline psychopathological differences between these subgroups, but the effect of treatment in the groups was predicted with an accuracy of 74.3% (P=0.003). In conclusion, electrophysiology and cognition data may be used to classify subgroups of schizophrenia patients. The two distinct subgroups, which we identified, were psychopathologically inseparable before treatment, yet their response to dopaminergic blockade was predicted with significant accuracy. This proof of principle encourages further endeavors to apply data-driven, multivariate and multimodal models to facilitate progress from symptom-based psychiatry toward individualized treatment regimens.

Neural oscillatory activity serving sensorimotor control is predicted by superoxide-sensitive mitochondrial redox environments.	DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2104569118	Motor control requires a coordinated ensemble of spatiotemporally precise neural oscillations across a distributed motor network, particularly in the beta range (15 to 30 Hz) to successfully plan and execute volitional actions. While substantial evidence implicates beta activity as critical to motor control, the molecular processes supporting these microcircuits and their inherent oscillatory dynamics remain poorly understood. Among these processes are mitochondrial integrity and the associated redox environments, although their direct impact on human neurophysiological function is unknown. Herein, 40 healthy adults completed a motor sequence paradigm during magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG data were imaged in the time-frequency domain using a beamformer to evaluate beta oscillatory profiles during distinct phases of motor control (i.e., planning and execution) and subsequent behavior. To comprehensively quantify features of the mitochondrial redox environment, we used state-of-the-art systems biology approaches including Seahorse Analyzer to assess mitochondrial respiration and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure superoxide levels in whole blood as well as antioxidant activity assays. Using structural equation modeling, we tested the relationship between mitochondrial function and sensorimotor brain-behavior dynamics through alterations in the redox environment (e.g., generation of superoxide and alteration in antioxidant defenses). Our results indicated that superoxide-sensitive but not hydrogen peroxide-sensitive features of the redox environment had direct and mediating effects on the bioenergetic-neural pathways serving motor performance in healthy adults. Importantly, our results suggest that alterations in the redox environment may directly impact behavior above and beyond mitochondrial respiratory capacities alone and further may be effective targets for age- and disease-related declines in cognitive-motor function.

Cerebral gustatory activation in response to free fatty acids using gustatory evoked potentials in humans.	DOI: 10.1194/jlr.M086587	There is some evidence of specific oro-detection of FFAs in rodents and humans. The aim of this study was to record gustatory evoked potentials (GEPs) in response to FFA solutions and to compare GEPs in response to linoleic acid solution with GEPs obtained after stimulation with sweet and salty tastants. Eighteen healthy men were randomly stimulated with fatty (linoleic acid), sweet (sucrose), and salty (NaCl) solutions at two concentrations in the first experiment. Control recordings (n = 14) were obtained during stimulation by a paraffin oil mixture without FFA or by water. In the second experiment, 28 men were randomly stimulated with five FFA solutions and a paraffin emulsion. GEPs were recorded with electroencephalographic electrodes at Cz, Fz, and Pz. GEPs were observed in response to FFA in all participants. GEP characteristics did not differ according to the quality and the concentration of the solutions in the first experiment and according to the FFA in the second experiment. This study describes for the first time GEPs in response to FFA and demonstrates that the presence of FFA in the mouth triggers an activation of the gustatory cortex. These data reinforce the concept that fat taste could be the sixth primary taste.

Single-Dose Memantine Improves Cortical Oscillatory Response Dynamics in Patients with Schizophrenia.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2017.81	Aberrant gamma-band (30-80 Hz) oscillations may underlie cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (SZ). Gamma oscillations and their regulation by NMDA receptors can be studied via their evoked power (γEP) and phase locking (γPL) in response to auditory steady-state stimulation; these auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) may be biomarkers for target engagement and early therapeutic effects. We previously reported that memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, enhanced two biomarkers of early auditory information processing: prepulse inhibition and mismatch negativity (MMN) in SZ patients and healthy subjects (HS). Here, we describe memantine effects on γEP and γPL in those subjects. SZ patients (n=18) and HS (n=14) received memantine 20 mg (p.o.) and placebo over 2 test days in a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over design. The ASSR paradigm (1 ms, 85 dB clicks in 250-0.5 s trains at a frequency of 40 Hz; 0.5 s inter-train interval) was used to assess γEP and γPL. SZ patients had reduced γEP and γPL; memantine enhanced γEP and γPL (p<0.025 and 0.002, respectively) in both SZ and HS. In patients, significant correlations between age and memantine effects were detected for γEP and γPL: greater memantine sensitivity on γEP and γPL were present in younger SZ patients, similar to our reported findings with MMN. Memantine acutely normalized cortical oscillatory dynamics associated with NMDA receptor dysfunction in SZ patients. Ongoing studies will clarify whether these acute changes predict beneficial clinical, neurocognitive and functional outcomes. These data support the use of gamma-band ASSR as a translational end point in pro-cognitive drug discovery and early-phase clinical trials.

Effects of NMDA receptor antagonist memantine on mismatch negativity.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2007.01.007	Mismatch negativity (MMN) and its magnetic counterpart (MMNm) have been shown to be altered in patients with various psychiatric and neurological disorders, e.g. Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, indicating deficits in involuntary attention. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated glutamate dysfunction is suggested to underlie these deficits. However, the role of NMDA receptors in involuntary attention is poorly understood. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to investigate whether a single dose of memantine would affect MMN/MMNm in healthy subjects studied with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Monaural left-ear auditory stimuli were presented in a passive oddball paradigm with infrequent deviant tones differing in frequency and duration. Neuronal activity was recorded in 13 healthy subjects after oral administration of 30mg of memantine or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. MMNm was analyzed using equivalent current dipoles. MMN was evaluated from frontocentral electrodes. Memantine lowered subjects' arousal level as measured by visual analog scales, and enhanced the amplitude of MMN in EEG. No differences in MMN latency were observed in MEG or EEG. Memantine did not affect the location, strength, amplitude or latency of MMNm, P1m, and N1m components. No changes in amplitude or latency were observed for P1 and N1 peaks. These results indicate that memantine affects involuntary attention without otherwise changing auditory processing of the stimuli. As memantine-induced changes in MMN were detected only in EEG, we suggest that the effect is mostly related to the frontal cortex.

Genetic variability in the human cannabinoid receptor 1 is associated with resting state EEG theta power in humans.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bbr.2014.08.003	It has long been postulated that exogenous cannabinoids have a profound effect on human cognitive functioning. These cannabinoid effects are thought to depend, at least in parts, on alterations of phase-locking of local field potential neuronal firing. The latter can be measured as activity in the theta frequency band (4-7Hz) by electroencephalogram. Theta oscillations are supposed to serve as a mechanism in neural representations of behaviorally relevant information. However, it remains unknown whether variability in endogenous cannabinoid activity is involved in theta rhythms and therefore, may serve as an individual differences index of human cognitive functioning. To clarify this issue, we recorded resting state EEG activity in 164 healthy human subjects and extracted EEG power across frequency bands (δ, θ, α, and β). To assess variability in the endocannabinoid system, two genetic polymorphisms (rs1049353, rs2180619) within the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) were determined in all participants. As expected, we observed significant effects of rs1049353 on EEG power in the theta band at frontal, central and parietal electrode regions. Crucially, these effects were specific for the theta band, with no effects on activity in the other frequency bands. Rs2180619 showed no significant associations with theta power after Bonferroni correction. Taken together, we provide novel evidence in humans showing that genetic variability in the cannabinoid receptor 1 is associated with resting state EEG power in the theta frequency band. This extends prior findings of exogenous cannabinoid effects on theta power to the endogenous cannabinoid system.

Disrupted gamma-band neural oscillations during coherent motion perception in heavy cannabis users.	DOI: 10.1038/npp.2014.166	Previous work in animals and humans has shown that exogenous cannabinoids disrupt time-locked, evoked gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz). However, no studies to date have examined the effect of cannabis on non-time-locked, induced gamma oscillations during more complex Gestalt perception. The current study therefore utilized electroencephalography (EEG) to examine gamma oscillations during coherent motion perception in heavy cannabis users and controls. Chronic cannabis users (n = 24; 12 h abstinence before study; positive 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol urine levels) and cannabis-naive controls (n = 23) were evaluated. Stimuli consisted of random dot kinetograms (RDKs) that subjects passively viewed during three different conditions: coherent motion, incoherent motion, and static. Time × frequency analysis on EEG data was performed using Fourier-based mean trial power (MTP). Transient event-related potentials (ERPs) to stimulus onset (visual N100 and P200 components) were also evaluated. The results showed that the coherent motion condition produced a robust increase in neural activity in the gamma range (induced power from 40 to 59 Hz) as compared with the incoherent motion and static conditions. As predicted, the cannabis group showed significant reductions in induced gamma power in the coherent condition relative to healthy controls. No differences were observed between the groups in the N100 or P200 components, indicating intact primary sensory processing. Finally, cannabis users showed a trend toward increased scores on the Chapman Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) that was positively correlated with total years of active cannabis use. These data suggest that cannabis use may interfere with the generation of induced gamma-band neural oscillations that could in part mediate the perceptual-altering effects of exogenous cannabinoids.

Electroencephalographic Fractal Dimension in Healthy Ageing and Alzheimer's Disease.	DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0149587	"Brain activity is complex; a reflection of its structural and functional organization. Among other measures of complexity, the fractal dimension is emerging as being sensitive to neuronal damage secondary to neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here, we calculated Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD) in resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 41 healthy controls (age: 20-89 years) and 67 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients (age: 50-88 years), to investigate whether HFD is sensitive to brain activity changes typical in healthy aging and in AD. Additionally, we considered whether AD-accelerating effects of the copper fraction not bound to ceruloplasmin (also called ""free"" copper) are reflected in HFD fluctuations. The HFD measure showed an inverted U-shaped relationship with age in healthy people (R2 = .575, p < .001). Onset of HFD decline appeared around the age of 60, and was most evident in central-parietal regions. In this region, HFD decreased with aging stronger in the right than in the left hemisphere (p = .006). AD patients demonstrated reduced HFD compared to age- and education-matched healthy controls, especially in temporal-occipital regions. This was associated with decreasing cognitive status as assessed by mini-mental state examination, and with higher levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper. Taken together, our findings show that resting-state EEG complexity increases from youth to maturity and declines in healthy, aging individuals. In AD, brain activity complexity is further reduced in correlation with cognitive impairment. In addition, elevated levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper appear to accelerate the reduction of neural activity complexity. Overall, HDF appears to be a proper indicator for monitoring EEG-derived brain activity complexity in healthy and pathological aging."

An observational study on the influence of the APOE-epsilon4 allele on the correlation between 'free' copper toxicosis and EEG activity in Alzheimer disease.	DOI: 10.1016/j.brainres.2008.03.066	Since many years the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (APOE-epsilon4) is known to be associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) but the mechanisms of these associations remained unclear. In the last years, the potential pathogenetic role of 'free' copper (i.e. non-ceruloplasmin bound copper) has been evidenced in AD. Recently, elevated 'free' copper was found to be correlated with slowing of cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms. The present work aimed to check the hypothesis that the strength of the correlations between free-copper and alterations of cortical rhythms might be different in carriers and non-carriers of the APOE-epsilon4 allele. Fifty-four AD patients and 20 healthy controls were included in the study. In all of them 1) APOE genotyping was performed; 2) total serum copper and ceruloplasmin was determined in order to calculate the serum 'free' copper; and 3) resting eyes-closed EEG rhythms were recorded and spectral brain activity was estimated via LORETA. A 'two correlation coefficients comparison' test was used to test the strength of the correlation in APOE-epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers. 'Free' copper levels were higher in patients than in controls and correlated positively with parietal-temporal delta and negatively with parieto-temporal alpha-1 activities. The correlation between 'free' copper and temporal alpha-1 activity was stronger in APOE-epsilon4 carriers than in non-carriers. Peroxide levels correlated with higher temporal delta in the AD group. APOE-epsilon4 appears to modulate the effect of copper on the altered AD brain activities, suggesting that modulation of oxidative stress related to copper dysfunction may be one of the mechanisms that make APOE-epsilon4 a risk factor for AD.

Prospective associations between lateralised brain function and immune status in HIV infection: analysis of EEG, cognition and mood over 30 months.	DOI: 10.1016/s0167-8760(96)00064-5	Prospective relations between individual differences in both lateralised neuro-psychophysiological functions and mood ratings with immune status (CD4 and CD8 counts) were examined in asymptomatic HIV-positive men (n = 27) over thirty months. They participated in a controlled study of zidovudine versus placebo (results published elsewhere). Measures included EEG spectra, neuropsychological tests and mood ratings. A model of reciprocal lateralised influences on the immune system was tested whereby patients with left superior to right hemispheric functions were predicted to show a less deleterious outcome than those with the opposite asymmetry pattern. Prospective relations with immune status were found in the EEG with lateralised theta, alpha and beta activity; among cognitive measures with word fluency, semantic processing, and lateralised motor and recognition memory (word/face) processes; with mood ratings including depression, confusion and the total mood score. The nature of the effects supported the laterality predictions. These unique data, showing that neuro-psychophysiological factors in HIV+ but otherwise healthy subjects predict immune competence and compromise present 2-3 years later, warrant replication in a larger cohort.

From the untreated patients in stage Walter Reed (WR) = 6, 71.4% had abnormal P3-ERP latencies, whereas in WR = 2, only 19.6% of P3-ERPs were abnormal. Fourteen patients were observed over a period of 3-16 months. P3-ERP latencies were shortened in 7 patients under treatment with zidovudine. A marked increase in P3-ERP latencies was observed in 7 untreated HIV-infected patients. It is assumed that ERPs are a useful neurophysiological method to detect early cerebral dysfunction in HIV-infected patients.

Effects of moclobemide on sleep in healthy human subjects.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1990.tb05339.x	Ten healthy, normal subjects (5 male and 5 female) aged 20-28 years participated in this experimental study of the effect of moclobemide on sleep. The design consisted of 2 sessions of 5 nights each, comprising 1 adaptation night, 2 nights on placebo and 2 inputs of moclobemide 4 mg/kg (session B). The 2 sessions were separated by at least 15 days and their order was balanced and randomized. During the last 4 nights of each session, sleep parameters were recorded throughout the night according to standard procedures. Moclobemide at a dose of 4 mg/kg induced moderate changes in the sleep-wake balance: a significant increase in stage 1 on the second drug night, a slight increase in stage 2 and a significant decrease in paradoxical sleep on the 2 drug nights. There was also a moderate reduction in the number of rapid eye movements (REM) during paradoxical sleep, but the number of cycles and latency to paradoxical sleep were unchanged, as well as all other sleep parameters measured. With 6.5 mg/kg, the changes were more pronounced: total sleep time was diminished, but this was significant only on the second and third nights. Transient awakenings increased significantly on the first drug night, and wakening latency decreased. The only modification of orthodox sleep was an increase in the percentage of stage 2 on the first drug night, whereas slow-wave sleep was unchanged. Paradoxical sleep was reduced on the first 2 drug nights, but tolerance appeared on the third night. The decrease in paradoxical sleep was exacerbated in the last part of the night. REM were decreased during paradoxical sleep.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	['Adult', 'Benzamidespharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electroencephalographydrug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Moclobemide', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Sleep Stagesdrug effects', 'Sleep, REMdrug effects']	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2248081/	['Moclobemide']	[4235]	2248081	['1990']

Oscillatory functions affecting outcome of coronary heart disease: the hazard of too much or too little stability.	DOI: 10.1007/BF02691680	"The objective was to identify physiological and behavioral indicators predictive of sudden arrhythmic death in patients who had experienced myocardial infarction in the past. In a 10-year prospective study of 79 patients, 59 men and 20 women aged 36 to 76 who had suffered a well-documented myocardial infarction (MI) at some time in the past (6 weeks-5 years) were individually matched with healthy controls of age, sex, race, height, weight, educational background and type of job. Both patients and controls were reexamined and retested at intervals of 6-8 weeks throughout the first 7 years of the study. Fifty-three patients died, 7 of noncardiac disorders, 2 died of suicide. Forty-four, 31 men and 13 women died suddenly of apparent MI. Thirty-one, or 70% of them were autopsied. Eleven were found to have experienced a recent MI and 20 had only an old scar. Age was not a determinant of cardiac mortality among the patients. The average age of those who died was 56 and of survivors 53. Neither was the level of serum cholesterol concentration, the LDL/HDL ratio, or the treadmill test a significant determinant of death. The measured physiological data that did significantly correlate to the cardiac deaths at the 0.01 level of confidence were low RR variability or wide mean RR variation month to month, prolonged QT interval or wide mean QT variability month to month. The findings support the view that proper physiological balance requires some degree of instability, but not too little or too much. Walter Cannon in his first paper on homeostasis (Cannon, 1926), credited Charles Richet with this perception ""The living being is stable... In a sense it is stable because it is modifiable--the slight instability is the necessary condition for the true stability of the organism"" (Richet, 1990)."

Pharmacokinetics and safety of oral eletriptan during different phases of the menstrual cycle in healthy volunteers.	DOI: 10.1177/00912700122012922	The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of eletriptan in different phases of the menstrual cycle. Female volunteers (n = 16) with a regular menstrual cycle (28 +/- 4 days) received a single oral dose of 80 mg eletriptan during each of the four cycle phases: phase 1 (menses), days 1 to 4; phase 2 (follicular), days 6 to 10; phase 3 (ovulatory), days 11 to 13; and phase 4 (luteal), days 21 to 24. Eletriptan plasma concentrations were determined from serial plasma samples taken during a 24-hourperiod after dosing. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and ECG measurements were performed at baseline, 1 and 24 hours after dosing. No significant differences between phases were observed for maximum plasma concentration (cmax, range of means = 188-234 ng/ml), time to maximum concentration (tmax, range of means = 1.8-2.5 h), or systemic exposure (area under the curve [AUC], range of means = 1194-1514 ng x h/ml). Although there was a statistically significant difference in the terminal phase elimination rate constant (kel) between phases 1 and2 (0.175/h vs. 0.158/h, p = 0.044), the corresponding difference in terminal phase half-life (t 1/2) (4.0 h vs. 4.4 h) was not considered to be clinicallyrelevant. No clinically relevant differences in blood pressure, pulse rate, or ECG were observed, and the incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events were similar in all phases. The different phases of the menstrual cycle had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics, safety, or tolerability of oral 80 mg eletriptan in healthy females.

Identifying the affected hemisphere by (1)H-MR spectroscopy in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and no pathological findings in high resolution MRI.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2006.01293.x	Up to 30% of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) remain without remarkable changes in MRI. In this study we investigated the role of (1)H-MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) in lateralizing the affected hemisphere in the mentioned patient group. Twenty-two consecutive patients diagnosed with TLE were investigated by high resolution MRI and (1)H-MRS. We examined the incidence and diagnostic accuracy of temporal metabolite alterations determined by Linear Combination of Model Spectra (L C Model) via water reference. Metabolite values of each hemisphere of TLE patients were compared with healthy controls. Results of metabolite alterations were related to intensive video EEG focus localization. Reduction of N-acetylaspartate + N-acetylaspartyl-glutamate (tNAA) in the affected hemisphere revealed identification in six of nine patients (66%) with unilateral TLE. Group comparison revealed a significant reduction of tNAA (6.1+/-0.8*) in the involved temporal lobe compared with controls (6.67+/-0.4*, P=0.026). Choline levels were significantly increased in the affected hemisphere (1.42+/-0.17*) compared with healthy controls (1.22+/-0.17*, P=0.035). The results of our study show that (1)H-MRS is able to identify the affected hemisphere of MRI negative TLE patients and can be used as an additive tool in multimodal focus localization.

What do you have in mind? ERP markers of visual and auditory imagery.	DOI: 10.1016/j.bandc.2023.105954	This study aimed to investigate the psychophysiological markers of imagery processes through EEG/ERP recordings. Visual and auditory stimuli representing 10 different semantic categories were shown to 30 healthy participants. After a given interval and prompted by a light signal, participants were asked to activate a mental image corresponding to the semantic category for recording synchronized electrical potentials. Unprecedented electrophysiological markers of imagination were recorded in the absence of sensory stimulation. The following peaks were identified at specific scalp sites and latencies, during imagination of infants (centroparietal positivity, CPP, and late CPP), human faces (anterior negativity, AN), animals (anterior positivity, AP), music (P300-like), speech (N400-like), affective vocalizations (P2-like) and sensory (visual vs auditory) modality (PN300). Overall, perception and imagery conditions shared some common electro/cortical markers, but during imagery the category-dependent modulation of ERPs was long latency and more anterior, with respect to the perceptual condition. These ERP markers might be precious tools for BCI systems (pattern recognition, classification, or A.I. algorithms) applied to patients affected by consciousness disorders (e.g., in a vegetative or comatose state) or locked-in-patients (e.g., spinal or SLA patients).

Changes in neurovascular coupling with cerebral perfusion pressure indicate a link to cerebral autoregulation.	DOI: 10.1177/0271678X221076566	Cerebral autoregulation ensures a stable average blood supply to brain tissue across steady state cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) levels. Neurovascular coupling, in turn, relies on sufficient blood flow to meet neuronal demands during activation. These mechanisms break down in pathologies where extreme levels of CPP can cause dysregulation in cerebral blood flow. Here, we experimentally tested the influence of changes in CPP on neurovascular coupling in a hydrocephalus-type non-human primate model (n = 3). We recorded local neural and vascular evoked responses to a checkerboard visual stimulus, non-invasively, using electroencephalography and near-infrared spectroscopy respectively. The evoked signals showed changes in various waveform features in the visual evoked potentials and the hemodynamic responses, with CPP. We further used these signals to fit for a hemodynamic response function (HRF) to describe neurovascular coupling. We estimated n = 26 distinct HRFs at a subset of CPP values ranging from 40-120 mmHg across all subjects. The HRFs, when compared to a subject dependent healthy baseline (CPP 70-90 mmHg) HRF, showed significant changes in shape with increasing CPP (ρCPP = -0.55, p-valueCPP = 0.0049). Our study provides preliminary experimental evidence on the relationship between neurovascular coupling and CPP changes, especially when beyond the limits of static autoregulation.

The coupling of low-level auditory dysfunction and oxidative stress in psychosis patients.	DOI: 10.1016/j.schres.2017.02.002	Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia often present with low-level sensory deficits. It is an open question whether there is a functional link between these deficits and the pathophysiology of the disease, e.g. oxidative stress and glutathione (GSH) metabolism dysregulation. Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded from 21 psychosis disorder patients and 30 healthy controls performing an active, auditory oddball task. AEPs to standard sounds were analyzed within an electrical neuroimaging framework. A peripheral measure of participants' redox balance, the ratio of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities (GPx/GR), was correlated with the AEP data. Patients displayed significantly decreased AEPs over the time window of the P50/N100 complex resulting from significantly weaker responses in the left temporo-parietal lobe. The GPx/GR ratio significantly correlated with patients' brain activity during the time window of the P50/N100 in the medial frontal lobe. We show for the first time a direct coupling between electrophysiological indices of AEPs and peripheral redox dysregulation in psychosis patients. This coupling is limited to stages of auditory processing that are impaired relative to healthy controls and suggests a link between biochemical and sensory dysfunction. The data highlight the potential of low-level sensory processing as a trait-marker of psychosis.

Lipid peroxidation and antioxidative enzyme activities in childhood epilepsy.	DOI: 10.1177/088307380201700904	This study aimed to investigate the relationship among lipid peroxidation, subsequent activation of scavenger enzymes (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase), and the presence of structural abnormality in 52 epileptic children receiving monotherapy (medically responsive) or polytherapy (medically intractable). Plasma lipid peroxidation in epileptic patients with abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings significantly increased as compared with that of 16 healthy children (P < .05), whereas antioxidant enzymes were not significantly affected. Both medically controlled and intractable children with normal MRI had higher activities of superoxide dismutase than those of controls (P < .05). The activity of superoxide dismutase in epileptic patients with structural abnormality did not significantly change as compared with controls. Activity of glutathione peroxidase in all of the epileptic children was not significantly different from controls. The activity of antioxidant enzymes or plasma malonyldialdehyde levels did not correlate with duration of epilepsy, frequency of seizures (> one seizure per month or not), and the presence or localization (focal, multifocal, or generalized) of electroencephalographic or MRI abnormalities. Increased plasma lipid peroxidation may be causally related to the presence of structural abnormality rather than ongoing epileptic activity or therapy status.

Fractal Analysis of Electrophysiological Signals to Detect and Monitor Depression: What We Know So Far?	DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-47606-8_34	Depression is currently one of the most complicated public health problems with the rising number of patients, increasing partly due to pandemics, but also due to increased existential insecurities and complicated aetiology of disease. Besides the tsunami of mental health issues, there are limitations imposed by ambiguous clinical rules of assessment of the symptoms and obsolete and inefficient standard therapy approaches. Here we are summarizing the neuroimaging results pointing out the actual complexity of the disease and novel attempts to detect depression that are evidence-based, mostly related to electrophysiology. It is repeatedly shown that the complexity of resting-state EEG recorded in patients suffering from depression is increased compared to healthy controls. We are discussing here how that can be interpreted and what we can learn about future effective therapies. Also, there is evidence that novel options of treatment, like different modalities of electromagnetic stimulation, are successful just because they are capable of decreasing that aberrated complexity. And complexity measures extracted from electrophysiological signals of depression patients can serve as excellent features for further machine learning models in order to automatize detection. In addition, after initial detection and even selection of responders for further therapy route, it is possible to monitor the therapeutic flow for one person, which leads us to possible tailored treatment for patients suffering from depression.

Robust circadian rhythm in heart rate and its variability: influence of exogenous melatonin and photoperiod.	DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2869.2007.00581.x	Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) undergo marked fluctuations over the 24-h day. Although controversial, this 24-h rhythm is thought to be driven by the sleep-wake/rest-activity cycle as well as by endogenous circadian rhythmicity. We quantified the endogenous circadian rhythm of HR and HRV and investigated whether this rhythm can be shifted by repeated melatonin administration while exposed to an altered photoperiod. Eight healthy males (age 24.4 +/- 4.4 years) participated in a double-blind cross-over design study. In both conditions, volunteers were scheduled to 16 h-8 h rest : wake and dark : light cycles for nine consecutive days preceded and followed by 29-h constant routines (CR) for assessment of endogenous circadian rhythmicity. Melatonin (1.5 mg) or placebo was administered at the beginning of the extended sleep opportunities. For all polysomnographically verified wakefulness periods of the CR, we calculated the high- (HF) and low- (LF) frequency bands of the power spectrum of the R-R interval, the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (SDNN) and the square root of the mean-squared difference of successive NN intervals (rMSSD). HR and HRV variables revealed robust endogenous circadian rhythms with fitted maxima, respectively, in the afternoon (16:36 hours) and in the early morning (between 05:00 and 06:59 hours). Melatonin treatment phase-advanced HR, HF, SDNN and rMSSD, and these shifts were significantly greater than after placebo treatment. We conclude that endogenous circadian rhythmicity influences autonomic control of HR and that the timing of these endogenous rhythms can be altered by extended sleep/rest episodes and associated changes in photoperiod as well as by melatonin treatment.

Behavioral and Neurophysiological Markers of ADHD in Children, Adolescents, and Adults: A Large-Scale Clinical Study.	DOI: 10.1177/1550059421993340	This study aimed to re-evaluate the possible differences between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subjects and healthy controls in the context of a standard Go/NoGo task (visual continuous performance test [VCPT]), frequently used to measure executive functions. In contrast to many previous studies, our sample comprises children, adolescents, and adults. We analyzed data from 447 ADHD patients and 227 healthy controls. By applying multivariate linear regression analyses, we controlled the group differences between ADHD patients and controls for age and sex. As dependent variables we used behavioral (number of omission and commission errors, reaction time, and reaction time variability) and neurophysiological measures (event-related potentials [ERPs]). In summary, we successfully replicated the deviations of ADHD subjects from healthy controls. The differences are small to moderate when expressed as effect size measures (number of omission errors: d = 0.60, reaction time variability: d = 0.56, contingent negative variation (CNV) and P3 amplitudes: -0.35 < d < -0.47, ERP latencies: 0.21 < d < 0.29). Further analyses revealed no substantial differences between ADHD subtypes (combined, inattentive, and hyperactive/impulsive presentation), subgroups according to high- and low-symptomatic burden or methylphenidate intake for their daily routine. We successfully replicated known differences between ADHD subjects and controls for the behavioral and neurophysiological variables. However, the small-to-moderate effect sizes limit their utility as biomarkers in the diagnostic procedure. The incongruence of self-reported symptomatic burden and clinical diagnosis emphasizes the challenges of the present clinical diagnosis with low reliability, which partially accounts for the low degree of discrimination between ADHD subjects and controls.

Brain Dynamics of Action Monitoring in Higher-Order Motor Control Disorders: The Case of Apraxia.	DOI: 10.1523/ENEURO.0334-20.2021	Limb apraxia (LA) refers to a high-order motor disorder characterized by the inability to reproduce transitive actions on commands or after observation. Studies demonstrate that action observation and action execution activate the same networks in the human brain, and provides an onlooker's motor system with appropriate cognitive, motor and sensory-motor cues to flexibly implementing action-sequences and gestures. Tellingly, the temporal dynamics of action monitoring has never been explored in people suffering from LA. To fill this gap, we studied the electro-cortical signatures of error observation in human participants suffering from acquired left-brain lesions with (LA+) and without (LA-) LA, and in a group of healthy controls (H). EEG was acquired while participants observed from a first-person perspective (1PP) an avatar performing correct or incorrect reach-to-grasp a glass action in an immersive-virtual environment. Alterations of typical EEG signatures of error observation in time (early error positivity; Pe) and time-frequency domain (theta band-power) were found reduced in LA+ compared with H. Connectivity analyses showed that LA+ exhibited a decreased theta phase synchronization of both the frontoparietal and frontofrontal network, compared with H and LA-. Moreover, linear regression analysis revealed that the severity of LA [test of upper LA (TULIA) scores] was predicted by mid-frontal error-related theta activity, suggesting a link between error monitoring capacity and apraxic phenotypes. These results provide novel neurophysiological evidence of altered neurophysiological dynamics of action monitoring in individuals with LA and shed light on the performance monitoring changes occurring in this disorder.
